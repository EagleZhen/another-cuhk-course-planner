      "description": "Traditional finance seeks to understand financial markets assuming that investors are “rational.” Rationality means that investors can access to and have the ability to process information correctly and that competition between investors ensures that securities are correctly priced to reflect all available information. That is, the market is efficient. However, recent studies suggest that markets are not efficient and that investors are not fully rational. For example, particular trading strategies based on past information such as past returns and accounting information are able to outperform the markets. In addition, studies find that investors are committed to certain heuristic-based biases and frame dependent such as overconfidence, optimism, self-attribution, illusion of control, loss aversion, representativeness heuristic, anchoring, availability, ambiguity aversion, hindsight, flaming, etc. Behavioral biases combined with limits to arbitrage may result in securities not to be correctly priced.This course will help students understand how individuals’ attitudes and behaviors affect their financial decisions and financial markets. In the practical side, this course will emphasize the role of investors’ psychological biases on various types of market inefficiency and show that how sophisticated investors can take advantage of these behavioral biases. This is a research oriented course with emphasis on both psychology theories and data analysis skills.",

Some of these companies are optimising scarce capital with AI and machine learning techniques, as well as back-testing models and analysing the market impact of trading large positions. Hedge funds, broker-dealers, and other firms are using AI to find signals for higher (and uncorrelated) returns and optimise trading execution.

      "description": "This course delves into the major issues surrounding equity fund-raising in China. The principal focus is on initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned issues in Chinese stocks (including H- share, ‘red-chip’, private Chinese and ‘China-concept’ issuers) listed in Hong Kong. The characteristics of the various corporate entities and the nature of the funding methods utilized are critically explored. Case analysis of major IPO and seasoned equity issues (rights issues and private placings) features to amplify these objectives. Shanghai A- share listings are also considered as well as the various reforms to its constituent issuers. These include the transformation of non-tradable stock holdings into tradable form, the development of QFII and QDII schemes and the key reforms to China’s leading state-owned commercial banks. Finally, dual listings, such as American depositary receipts, and alternative routes to listing (‘reverse takeovers’) are also assessed. Upon completion of the course, students will have developed key insights into a major global funding activity.",

The class will be conducted through both lectures and student presentations. Foundations in finance will be covered through lectures format. Note that the topics covered are an extension of (advanced) financial management, however the technical part will be reduced to a minimum. Students will be grouped and are required to present real cases in Hong Kong. It is not mandatory to work on a real project. However, students have the options to do so. The class is required to apply the efficient markets hypothesis to analyze stock markets' responses to takeover announcements. Welfare gains or losses to shareholders will also be computed. Computations for the cost of capital and intrinsic value of targets, by using the dividend discount model and the free cash model, will also be required. The final project should be a comprehensive integration of all materials learned in class.",

      "description": "This course integrates areas within financial management and investments to analyse merger and acquisition (takeover) markets. The class will be conducted using both lectures and presentations. The topics covered in lectures include an overview of takeover markets, legal aspects and restrictions, capital budgeting techniques, the efficient market hypothesis, the market model and computation of abnormal returns, the dividend discount model and the free cash flow model. The topics covered in presentations will include US and Hong Kong cases of mergers, tender offers and leveraged buyouts. Amongst other things, the efficient market hypothesis is applied to analyse the stock market response to takeover announcement as well as a range of other issues including: welfare gains/losses associated with takeover, the cost of capital for due acquiror and the intrinsic value of the target (using dividend discount and free cashflow models).",

This course will cover key fintech concepts such as virtual banking, blockchain, digital currencies, tokenization, and others. Examining a variety of case studies drawn from the industry, students will learn about recent developments in fintech from the perspectives of entrepreneurs, consumers and regulators. While Asian cases will be emphasized, some American and European examples will also be discussed so that students will acquire a global view of the subject. A few industry practitioners will be invited as guest speakers to share their entrepreneurial experience in fintech with students. This is an introductory course where computer programming is not required. However, basic knowledge in financial valuation analysis and statistics will be useful. The objective is to learn about the use of new technologies in solving business problems, and appreciate how current fintech trends will impact and shape the financial industry in the future.",

      "description": "This course provides an overview of the basic tools in machine learning, with emphases on applications in finance. Machine learning plays an important role in FinTech. Individual investors and financial institutions who are able to leverage these new tools and technology will have a significant advantage. This course discusses these new opportunities and challenges. It seeks to equip students with these highly coveted skills in the market. We will cover topics including: cluster analysis, decision trees, support vector machines, flexible discriminants, and neural networks, accompanied with the corresponding financial applications. Real world finance problems often deal with large datasets, traditionally with historical price and return as well as data on financial statements. More recently, other databases like consumer credit and online data (e.g., Google search, news media, satellite images, etc.) are also becoming more important for financial analysts. Dealing with such large datasets require tools to manipulate them, and we will introduce the use of Python and detailed instructions on how to perform analysis on large datasets. Once students become comfortable with the use of Python and manipulation of large sets, we will introduce students to tools in machine learning, which play an important role in our financial market, from approving loans, managing portfolios, to assessing risks. Advances in machine learning technology have enabled financial institutions to explore the applications of artificial intelligence in areas like customer service, personal finance, wealth management, and risk management.",

As VC is a subset of private equity, the course will discuss the management, legal and marketing issues of private equity in general. Topics include raising and structuring private equity funds, the limited partnership, and fund strategies. The course will consider the investment decision of institutional investors in private equity and how funds are structured to meet their needs. It will discuss post-subscription private equity fund management - deal screening, evaluation, negotiation, disbursement, investee management, valuation and exit - and will consider specifically the perspective of the VC investee company - alternative sources of financing, how to approach a VC to maximize chances of success, and governance issues in VC financed firms. The course may also delve into public versus private equity buyouts, valuation of buyouts and corporate restructuring under private equity.",

      "description": "Traditional finance seeks to understand financial markets assuming that investors are \"rational\". Rationality means that investors can access to and have the ability to process information correctly and that competition between investors ensures that securities are correctly priced to reflect all available information. That is, the market is efficient. However, recent studies suggest that markets are not efficient and that investors are not fully rational. For example, particular trading strategies based on past information such as past returns and accounting information are able to outperform the markets. In addition, studies find that investors are committed to certain heuristic-based biases and frame dependent such as overconfidence, optimism, self-attribution, illusion of control, loss aversion, representativeness heuristic, anchoring, availability, ambiguity aversion, hindsight, flaming, etc. Behavioral biases combined with limits to arbitrage may result in securities not to be correctly priced.This course will help students understand how individuals’ attitudes and behaviors affect their financial decisions and financial markets. In the practical side, this course will emphasize the role of investors’ psychological biases on various types of market inefficiency and show that how sophisticated investors can take advantage of these behavioral biases. This is a research oriented course with emphasis on both psychology theories and data analysis skills.",
