In this multi-dimensional society of chaos and uncertainty, the younger generation is prone to confusion and a lack of direction. This course aims to help students who have just reached adulthood to understand personal growth, to develop self-acceptance, to reflect upon their self-identity and to recognize the impact of the rapid changing society on an individual. It is hoped that the course can assist students to develop direction and values in facing various life tasks, prepare them for choices in life path and equip them with a proactive manner in future study / career.",

There are different attitudes towards these socially disadvantaged groups: discrimination, avoidance, sympathy, acceptance and understanding. The course reviews how these attitudes were constructed socially and spread in our society. The course aims to promote students’ reflection and to enhance their understanding on the causes and livelihood of the socially disadvantaged. Experiential learning opportunity such as community visits, community education projects with involvement of the disadvantaged groups in social change are means to be employed to facilitate students’ learning and to achieve the goal of empowerment. Related community resources and methods to improve the well-being of the disadvantaged group will also be discussed. This course is inter-disciplinary in focus, emphasizing social, cultural, historical, and geographical aspects of exclusion and marginalization. Theories of social exclusion, social justice, social construction etc. will be introduced.",

      "description": "(UGED1602 is double-coded with SOWK1130.)\n\nDeath is not special. It happens every day and everywhere. It is also an inevitable part of life. Yet, death is very important for us especially when we are confronted by the death and dying of our loved ones. Surprisingly, we have done little to prepare ourselves to get familiar with the topic of bereavement. Very often we learn it only from the most painful and heartbreaking moments in life—after the death of loved ones. While bereavement may induce us different grief reactions, and adjustment difficulties, it also provides an opportunity for us to experience personal growth, reflect on our values and search for the meaning in life.\n\nAs a result, this course aims to prepare students to face death, dying and bereavement that they may encounter in their life. In particular, they are facilitated to respond to a unique question, “How can I live with the grief?” This question can only be answered by the students themselves who will have an opportunity to understand more about death, dying and bereavement, as well as reflecting on their life and living through this course.",

Through different online materials and interactive exercises, students can learn how to assess the needs of different communities, define objectives, design service projects creatively, implement the projects to meet these needs, and develop methods to evaluate the outcomes. Students will be encouraged to reflect on how the knowledge and skills that they have acquired in their own disciplines may facilitate the development of S-L projects. It is designed in the form of self-paced e-Learning modules which can be taken as a standalone prerequisite to students’ self-initiated service projects.",

Apart from introducing contemporary theories and conceptual perspectives about cultural sensitivity and cultural intelligence, this course will also highlight major discourses and challenges concerning access, equity, social inclusiveness, cultural assimilation and integration which have substantial impact on ethnic minorities as well as social harmony. Through participation in small group projects, guided community tours, and face-to-face interaction with different ethnic groups, students will be able to develop an awareness of the differences in values, beliefs, life-style and interpersonal relatedness between themselves and people of other ethnic background. Basic skills, knowledge and attitude required of cultural intelligence, equal-opportunity legislations, social policies, service provision in meeting the needs of ethnic minorities, and measures to promote mutual acceptance and social inclusiveness will be discussed.",

Theories of human capital, social capital, social exclusion, and globalization will be introduced to understand the causes and impacts of poverty and social exclusion. Upon completion of the course, students are expected to apply relevant theories in the analysis and practice to alleviate the poverty and social exclusion situations of different vulnerable populations, for example welfare recipients, women, working poor and ethnic minorities. Recent trends and issues on poverty and poverty alleviation will be discussed in the social context of Hong Kong and the changing regional and global environment.",

      "description": "This course combines the concepts of expressive arts in healing and basic working principles of arts-based social work practice. It is not creative arts therapy training, but exploring the resources of expressive arts for facilitating social work practice. The course is designed for social work students who are interested in learning the application of arts in counseling, group, and community work. It is also appropriate for those wishing to awake the seeds of creativity and make use of their inner resources for both personal growth and professional development.\n\nExpressive arts are powerful verbal, nonverbal, and imaginative tools for self-expression and communication. This arts-based social work practice is action-oriented and process-focused. Students have an opportunity to experiment the use of arts for creative exploration and self-understanding so that they can synthesize their personal experience with conceptual learning.\n\nAdvisory: For majors only",

It looks at whether and how far social policy and social welfare in East Asia are different from those of the Western welfare states in terms of role and functions of state and society in the arrangement of welfare, culture and social values, policy instruments, and outcome measures. The social welfare systems in East Asia, in particular with that of Hong Kong in comparison with the rest will be highlighted. The students will be benefited from the comparative perspective for an understanding of the specific context where social policy in Hong Kong and East Asia has developed and the challenges it now faces amidst growing social disparities and economic globalization.",

      "description": "To address the digital transformation challenges faced by social services agencies, alignment of ICT strategy with organisation reality across all levels involves the development of a roadmap for ICT adoption and organisation transformation. Practitioners need knowledge and skills to grow their digital competency over time in adapting to the latest digital landscape for delivering more engaging social services.\nThe purpose of this course is to help students navigate the digital transformation maze through sound program/project management in an evidence-based context. The main goals of digital transformation are needs and competencies assessment, workflow change, and system integration of logic models in supporting data driven decision making. Social service agencies have to put the data in order and equip operation staff with the needed knowledge and skills to function effectively and efficiently.\nUse of design thinking and lean startup approach will be integrated into digital social services development and implementation as covered in this course. Furthermore, students will learn to use no-code/low-code digital tools to implement a fully integrated data driven information management and service system. The completed system can be used for ongoing data collection, statistical analysis, and data visualisation for event promotion, service program tracking, volunteer recruitment, impact evaluation, donation accounting, and funding application.",

The course furthermore examines approaches to youth work in contemporary societies, with emphases on reflective understanding of the problems and needs of today’s youth, and critical appraisal of major youth work models. Current policy issues related to human rights and well-being of young people will also be discussed.",
