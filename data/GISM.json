The course begins by introducing the basic principle of remote sensing and an overview of remote sensing applications. On one hand, individual topics covering the application of remote sensing in vegetation, urban landscape, water and hydrology are discussed. On the other hand, various kinds of remotely-sensed data including high-resolution, thermal, hyperspectral, radar are introduced. This course is taught with lectures, laboratories and individual projects. Lectures will be accompanied by laboratories for students to grasp both the theoretical and application issues of remote sensing. Students are required to initiate, present and submit individual project to complete the course requirement.",

The use of GIS in various urban applications relevant to big data will also be covered. These applications encompass urban form, public health, 3D GIS, and geodesign. Through hands-on lab exercises such as data crawling from the web, 3D urban model construction using CityEngine, and geodesign using Geoplanner, students are expected to understand how geospatial big data can be applied to address real-world challenges in the urban environment, and to grasp more advanced skills relating to GIS applications.",
