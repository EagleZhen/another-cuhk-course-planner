The course begins by introducing the basic principle of remote sensing and an overview of remote sensing applications. On one hand, individual topics covering the application of remote sensing in vegetation, urban landscape, water and hydrology are discussed. On the other hand, various kinds of remotely-sensed data including high-resolution, thermal, hyperspectral, radar are introduced. This course is taught with lectures, laboratories and individual projects. Lectures will be accompanied by laboratories for students to grasp both the theoretical and application issues of remote sensing. Students are required to initiate, present and submit individual project to complete the course requirement.",
