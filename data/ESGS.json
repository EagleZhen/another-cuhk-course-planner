      "description": "This course provides an introduction of a wide spectrum of spatial analytical models and their applications in environment, health, and public management. The course has two major aims. On the technical front, this course aims to teach students fundamental concepts and recent progress of spatial analysis. On the substantive front, this course integrates the introduction to spatial analytics with their applications in environment, health, and public management, ranging from mapping the inequality among economic and health outcomes, to environmental quality evaluation and innovative census using remote sensing and locational based service. After completing this course, students are expected to have a sound working knowledge of GIS and spatial data analysis and an ability to identify and apply proper analytical methods to problem solving, and to correctly and appropriately interpret and present analysis results.",

      "description": "This course describes broad principles of Environmental Sensor Network (SN), the integration with positioning technologies and its roles in contemporary environmental studies and smart cities developments. The integration of SN and positioning technologies offers a powerful combination of distributed sensing capacity, real time data visualization and spatial analysis and integration with remote sensing data sources. The combined technologies are greatly needed in large-scale environmental monitoring and Smart Cities developments.\n\nAnother half of the course introduces the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and other indoor positioning technologies. It covers the basic principles, advanced techniques as well as their applications in Earth System Sciences and urban management. With the background knowledge and the practical skills, students shall be able to integrate GNSS and SN in their future research and studies.",
