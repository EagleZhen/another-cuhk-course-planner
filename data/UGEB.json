      "description": "(UGEB1217 is double-coded with BMEG1217.)\n\nThis course exposes students to a range of state-of-the-arts developments in biomedical engineering. It invites students from various disciplines to discuss the long-term societal impacts and ethical implications of these technological advances, particularly in human enhancements beyond therapy. The course starts by illustrating the many amazing designs in our human body and yet how vulnerable we are in terms of injuries, diseases and ageing. Examples on how modern biomedical engineering helps us face our human conditions are given, such as musculoskeletal prosthetics and orthotics, cardiovascular implants, neuroengineering, stem cells and regenerative medicine, gene editing, bionanotechnology, intelligence and artificial intelligence and senses and artificial senses, etc. A historical account of human quest for “living” machine, including a brief coverage of modern movies on bionic human then follows. The course wraps up with some social, ethical and philosophical reflections on the above issues and on the meaning of being human, opening up questions concerning the perennial human quest of becoming super human.",

Describe some of the amazing designs in human body & their potential damages due to injuries, diseases, & ageing;\n2. Give examples on how engineering has helped in reconstructing damaged body parts and/or body functions, such as musculoskeletal prosthetics, cardiovascular implants, artificial sight, tissue & genetic engineering, etc.;\n3. Reflect on our human imagination about the bionic human of the future; and\n4. Discuss some of the philosophical, societal and ethical issues associated with such technological development.\n\nHigher-Order Learning and Literacy: Students will be given sets of thematic reading assignments (listed as common reading requirements in the Reading List and Reference section), and asked to question, discuss, and illustrate their readings using some instructor-prepared worksheets as guides. Throughout the subject, students will be drawn to reflect on their views on the distinct characteristics of being human. Each student is expected to critically review one of the selected books (given in the Reading List, total reading not less than 200 pages) in a book report (~2,500 words).\n\nLife-Long Learning: In this interdisciplinary subject, students will be constantly facilitated and drilled to learn across their disciplines. We regard such an interdisciplinary learning capacity an important skill for life-long learning.",
      "course_syllabus": "Human life is both amazing and vulnerable. Amazing – the designs and working of our human bodies are the envies of engineering science. Vulnerable – the best and the strongest are still mortal. We are susceptible to trauma, diseases, ageing and finally death. Advances in life science and engineering are bringing to us in fast cadence and big strides innovative breakthroughs and new possibilities in healing and rejuvenation, functional recoveries and health enablement. Powered intelligent prostheses for subjects with amputation, fully implantable artificial hearts for subjects with heart failures, tissue engineered skin for severely burnt subjects, stem cells therapies for impaired brain tissues are examples that our body can be fixed by replacing the defective components with artificial “spare parts” and other augmentative measures. At the same time, research laboratories are developing intelligent robots that can see, hear, smell, talk, walk, dance, think, and feel like human – following a centuries-long human quest for “living” machines. The mechanistic implications of these biomedical and engineering advances seem apparent – Is human a robot? Can robot one day become human? The artists among us are quick to perceive and even exploit these implications. The entertainment media have imaginatively presented many kinds of human-robotic hybrids, both as heroes and villains, often with power and abilities beyond those of a human. What could we tell about ourselves from our quests, pursuits, and dreams? How may one define the borderline between human and robot? What does it mean to be a human?\n\n| | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Course Syllabus | | | | | | **Week** | | **Session-1** | **Session-2** | **Session-3** | | 1 | | Introduction **Course Management** | **Amazing & Vulnerable Human** | YouTube Channels – Human Enhancement | | State of Science in Biomedical Engineering | | | | | | 2 | | DVD: Understanding Stem Cells | Lecture: **DNA Engineering** | **Artificial Intelligence** | | 3 | | DVD: The Brain: Episode 3 – Who is in control? | Lecture: **Neural Engineering** | Worksheet NAS, 2017, pg.1-13 | | 4 | | DVD: Brain Story: Episode #3 – Vision | Lecture: **Prosthetic Vision** | Worksheet Huxley,1932, pg. vii-xvii | | 5 | | TED Talk: Hugh Herr | Lecture: **Musculoskeletal Engineering** | Worksheet Buchanan, 2011, pg. 3-28 | | 6 | | DVD: The Brain: Episode 4 – How do I decide? | DVD: GATTACA | Worksheet Savulescu & Bostrom, pg. 1-22 | | 7 | | **Cardiovascular Engineering** | Lecture: **Tissue Engineering** | Worksheet Bess, 2015, pg.viii-xviii | | 8 | | DVD: Star Trek: The New Generations - the Measure of a Man | Lecture: **Humanoid Robotics** | Worksheet Sandel, 2007, pg. 1-24 | | 9 | | DVD: The Brain: Episode 5 – Why do I need you? | Lecture: **Living with Robots: Ethical & Social Issues** | Worksheet Lin et al, 2012, pg. 3-15 | | 10 | | DVD: The Brain: Episode 6 – Who will we be? | Lecture: **Optogenetics: using Light to Control Living Creatures** | Worksheet Baillie & Casey, 2005, pg.1-31 | | 11 | | Lecture **Transhumanism** TED Talk: Sebastian Seung - I am my Connectome | Lecture: **Critique of Transhumanism** | Worksheet Habermas, 2003, pg. 1-15 | | 12 | | DVD: Transcendence | Worksheet In-class reflection on personal enhancement | Lecture **Human Quest of Transformation** | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |",

      "description": "This course is designed to help students to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the global energy crisis and environmental issues our society is currently facing. The history of energy consumption shows how important energy is to the quality of life for the human beings. With the further development and the increase of the world population, our society is challenged by an unprecedented energy demand in 21st century. At the same time, the global warming and climate changes are also causing more and more attentions. How can we meet the future energy demand? What are the energy options we currently have and what are their impacts on the environment? How can we meet our energy needs without deteriorating the environment? The first half of this course will tackle the above-raised questions by examining our current energy options and their respective impacts on the environment. Then, to address both the energy and environmental concerns, possible routes to develop a green society will be discussed in the second half of this course with a focus on renewable energy resources, smart grid, eco-friendly vehicles, and carbon sequestration and carbon audit. Lab experiments are expected to be conducted to formulate and design several different renewable energy systems toward constructing a green society.

We will introduce different types of energy, from conventional fossil fuels to renewable sources, and understand their manufacturing, conversion, and utilization processes. In addition, we will discuss the environmental issues faced by modern society, such as climate change and air pollution, and explore how chemistry can provide solutions.\n\nClimate change and air pollution are closely related to energy. For examples, fossil fuel combustion can produce greenhouse gas (e.g. carbon dioxide CO2) that contribute to global warming. Combustion also produces sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) that can harm air quality and public health.\n\nThis course includes lectures, class discussion, group presentation and project report of selected topic, and final examination.",

Successful stories on the evolution of S&T in human history are introduced in the perspectives of STEM, i.e., from the discovery of fundamental Scientific (Physics) (S) principles, to applying the principles to Technological (T) innovations, solving Engineering (E) problems to make the applications viable, and with Mathematics (M) as the essential language that encompasses the whole process. Modern technology is also shown to change the ways of modern scientific investigation and accelerate human understanding of the physical world in an unprecedented speed. Science related social issues are used to help students understand the importance of using science principles and knowledge in making judgements and informed decisions. Lively demonstrations, lab visit, and STEM activities are used in class to (1) illustrate basic physics principles, (2) make physics principles more connected to students’ daily life applications, and (3) better prepare students for explaining science concepts and conducting basic educational STEM activities as an educator, publisher, reporter, and in other S&T related disciplines in the future.

The course also serves as a platform to understand and critically assess global environmental change, natural hazards, biodiversity loss, and the water-energy-food nexus, and explore potential technological and policy solutions to these problems. These objectives align strongly with the understanding and pursuit of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG#7 Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG#13 Climate Action, SDG#14 Life Below Water, and SDG#15 Life on Land. In addition to attending lectures, students will visit the Jockey Club Museum of Climate Change where it displays the way scientists examine past and current climate and the factors leading to current global temperature change. A geological field excursion will be another highlight of the course to demonstrate the scientific concepts applied to reveal Earth’s tectonic history, evolution and interaction among various spheres. With diverse scientific topics in Earth’s systems, the course shows students how each Earth’s system is interlocking with other spheres and, hence raise the awareness in the importance of sustainability.",

      "description": "The course aims at providing a short introduction to many popular physics ideas used in movies. There are many modern physics ideas that have captured the imagination of people, and many popular science fiction movies love to use these ideas for artistic or plot purposes. In this course, we will take a look at how these physics ideas are portrayed in selected movies, and have a discussion on how much of these are based on real science, or just pure fiction. The course also explores from a broader perspective how the advances in science and technology inspire the creation of art and pop culture, and how these derived ideas inspire generations of young people to unravel the mysteries of nature. Topics covered may include extraterrestrial civilization (Fermi paradox, SETI), spacetime travel, black holes, pulsars, space exploration, orbital dynamics, particle physics, antimatter, nuclear fusion/fission, quantum mechanics, superconductors, etc. Sometimes real physical phenomena can be even more bizarre than in movies!",

Where can we find them? What happens when we are near the black holes?\n3. Pulsars, SETI (Contact)\nWhat happens when stars die? What are pulsars? What are we doing to search for extraterrestrial intelligence?\n4. Orbital Dynamics, space exploration (Martian, Gravity)\nWhat are things that we need to consider if we want to colonize the solar system, or maybe beyond?\n5. 3-Body problem and Fermi Paradox (3 Body)\nWhy 3-body problem is not solvable? What is the logic behind the Fermi paradox?\n6. Asteroids and extinction events (Don’t look up)\nHow real is the danger of asteroid impacts? How did the dinosaurs go extinct?\n7. Quantum mechanics (Antman 1/2)\nWhy is the bizarre world of quantum mechanics?\n8. Anti-matter, particle colliders (Angels and Demons)\nWhat are the fundamental particles of nature?

It will examine the history and development of nature conservation in Hong Kong including legislation, designation and management of the protected areas. Specifically, country, marine parks and geopark are developed to protected terrestrial and marine habitats as well as the associated wildlife, and geodiversity, respectively. Threats and problems facing existing protected areas will be discussed. Nature conservation will be addressed through lectures, field trips and students’ projects. It will also introduce concepts and principles of nature conservation in the local and global context, including climate change, ecosystem services, geo-conservation and the global conservation efforts such as the World Summit and Convention of Biodiversity. The course helps students look at nature conservation from the perspective of sustainable development, incorporating the environmental, social and economic dimensions of development, focusing on SDG Goals 14 and 15 in particular. Both SDGs are directly linked to nature conservation efforts, focusing on preserving natural resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity, which are vital for the health of our planet, ensuring sustainable fishing/forest management practices for the benefit of communities.",

      "description": "Climate change is a subject of great interest to all concerned about the future of mankind. However, very few people realize that climate has always been changing since the formation of the Earth. Even fewer people realize that the living things in their totality exert a significant influence in shaping the evolution of the climate itself. One striking feature of the current climate change is that it has arisen from the action of one single species Homo sapiens, owing to its ability to master the use of an enormous amount of energy.\n\nThis course presents the story of the Earth's atmosphere since its inception up to the current time, illustrating the close interactions between the physical world and the living world. Observations about the life phenomenon are discussed, including the role of energy in the sustenance of life, individually and collectively. The changing climate has provided the context for the development of life on Earth, in terms of dispersion and diversity. The glacial periods have also shaped the habits and character of human beings. The arrival of the recent warm interglacial period facilitated the emergence of agriculture, enabling human beings to capture and utilize more energy in their life cycles. It brought about major changes to human beings' way of life as well as significant disruptions to the delicate balance in nature. Major turning points in history such as the emergence of civilizations, the conflict between nomads and pastoralists, wars and maritime colonialism are discussed in the climate context.\n\nIndustrial revolution and modern consumerism are discussed in terms of their energy consumption and the associated emission of greenhouse gases, which has given rise to the current man-made climate change. Other aspects of this enormous use of energy are discussed, including urbanization, the attrition of the self and human beings' increasing detachment from nature. Latest projections of the climate in the 21st century and the potential consequences are presented. How the human world would deal with the potential of hazardous climate change will be explored, including the particular problems faced by China as it is about to develop further. It would be a time to reflect on the core human values and how they are to be expressed in the new low-energy world.",

The course will discuss climate change from multiple perspectives of several physical and social sciences such as climatology, geography, geology, biology, history, and cultural and political studies. Therefore, students will not only gain basic knowledge of geophysical concepts and rules of climate, energy, and life, but also learn how climate change arises from the complex interactions between the physical environment and human society in geological and historical times. They will also learn to realize the phenomenal impacts of consumerism with its attendant energy expenditure, in the last half century on the Earth's climate. As concerned world citizens, students will need to be equipped with these capabilities and knowledge in order to better understand the emerging challenges posed by global warming and adopt mitigation measures for sustainable development.**",
      "course_syllabus": "A. The natural world:\n\nThis component covers the co-evolution of the physical world and the living world from the inception of the Earth up the point where agriculture emerged. The concept of the Earth’s atmosphere as the collective breath of life on Earth will be developed. In that process, the fundamental characteristics of life as an energy phenomenon will be discussed, to bring out ideas about energy flow and various cycles in nature. How the glacial periods and associated habitat changes shape the habits and character of human beings will be discussed.\n\nRelated course topics: 1. Introduction, atmosphere and climate; 2. Climate change, roles of greenhouse gases, aerosols and other agents in climate change;\n\nB. The world with agriculture:\n\nThis component examines the emergence of agriculture during the latest interglacial warm period and what happened afterwards as human beings have more energy at its disposal. The climate and geography of civilization emergence in association with agriculture are discussed. The subsequent changed way of life and attendant problems are examined, with a view to prompting students to re-evaluate the role of \"civilization\" in life. The broad course of human history, especially the major turning points, in the time scale of thousands of years will be discussed in the context of climate and its variability.\n\nRelated course topics: 3. Monsoon climate, Mediterranean climate, Semi-arid climate, floodplain and watershed; 4. and 5. Co-evolution of the physical world and the living world, agriculture and animal husbandry (I) (II)\n\nC. The burning world:\n\nThis component places its focus on the post-industrial revolution period in which human beings has mastered the use of even more energy. The link between the burning of fossil fuel to rapid changes in the atmospheric composition and the climate will be described. Other consequential impacts will be discussed, such as changes in the natural world and more subtly those in the human society. The inter-connection among energy, technology, urbanization, consumerism and climate change will be explored.\n\nRelated course topics: 6. Oil and war; 7. Coal and industrial revolution\n\nD. The future:\n\nThe imminent hazardous climate change in the 21st century and choices available to human beings as a species will be discussed. Various countries will be examined, to illustrate the complexity of the issues involved and the very fundamental nature of the decisions to be made.\n\nRelated course topics: 8. Global climate governance and carbon neutrality; 9. Carbon neutrality in individual countries; 10. Energy and climate geopolitics in 2050 and the rise and fall of economies",

      "description": "This course will provide an introduction of China’s major environmental crises at local, regional, national and global scales and at different stages of development. It covers topics from air pollution (both indoor and outdoor), water shortage (due to the lack of water resources and water pollution), soil pollution, waste management, desertification & deforestation, energy transition and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as climate change. The foci will not only cover the causes and seriousness of the crises from the perspectives of science, technology, society and governance, but also solutions and emerging norms related to the topics. The course endeavors to inspire students to reflect on their own communities and how to approach sustainable development goals at a variety of scales.\n\nMultiple of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals are closely relevant to the lectures, including (7) Affordable and Clean Energy, (6) Clean Water and Sanitation, (13) Climate Action, (12) Responsible Consumption and Production, (9) Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, and (17) Partnerships for the Goals.\n\nThis course uses an interdisciplinary approach to lead students through relevant key topics. Students from most departments in natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, public health, and business management will be able to find connections between these topics and their own disciplines. The approach will provide students chances to independently think about the problems beyond any discipline. Because environmental problems are frequently reflected in social and individual daily lives, the course will make students more informed in the increasingly globalizing society for their better contribution to more sustainable development.",

      "description": "Climate change, sea level rise, deforestation, forest fire, severe typhoon, glacier melt, agricultural loss, overpopulation, etc. are terms that you might have heard of. And they are also real and hot crises affecting the sustainability of human beings. How do we know these are all happening? In fact, our earth is being overseen from space every day. One good example is Google Earth that takes us any part of the globe anytime and anywhere using fingertips. Have you wondered where do these images come from? How these images are captured? How can images be used to understand the happening on our earth? Most of these images are captured by giant machines hovering in space known as satellites. “Remote sensing” is the process to collect images from the space or in the air, which is one of the key tools in the regime of spatial information technology. Important information are extracted from these images to gain better understanding of status quo and be more sustainable and responsible to our home – Earth.\n\nThis course allows students to acquire basic knowledge of remote sensing and to understand how the technology is used to the study and monitor of our earth. The course is divided into two parts. The first part elucidates the basic concept of remote sensing as well as the skills in extracting information from images. The second part unveils the applications of remote sensing images to crucial sustainability issues such as urban development, agriculture, forest management, natural disaster, climate change, etc. These applications connect with three Sustainable Development Goals including #11 (sustainable cities and community), #13 (climate action) and #15 (life on land) set by the United Nations in 2015. Loads of remotely-sensed images are used to illustrate the natural process and human activities that alter the earth surface and to explore the issue of sustainability. Together with hands-on work in tutorials and interactive class activity, students would be aware of how this novel technology is exploring the future of human beings.",

      "description": "Music is an art and a science. Questions like “how do we perceive music,” “how does music arouse emotions in us,” “can artificial intelligence (AI) perceive music like us,” “how can AI recognize emotions expressed in music,” “can AI arouse emotions in us through music” are all scientific in nature. This interdisciplinary course invites students to analyse and appreciate music from two scientific perspectives, namely, psychology and AI. It begins with musical elements, which are the basic building blocks of music, from the viewpoint of both music perception and production. The science behind those elements is explored with an emphasis on how they evoke emotions. We then examine the basic concepts of AI and its capability of producing music applications including music emotion recognition and automatic music composition. Along with interactive lectures, students will engage in hands-on experiences and class discussions that culminate towards various music-related AI projects. No prior knowledge in music or programming is required.",

      "description": "As the most populous country in the world, China is confronted by the problems of overpopulation, water scarcity, energy shortage, desertification, drought, floods, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Since 1978 the economy has grown rapidly and as of to date, it has become a rising economic power of the world. However, the environmental and ecological problems have reached a point whereby sustainable growth is jeopardized. To solve the problems of limited resource per capita, as well as encourage economic development, China has implemented and planned for a series of mega projects of far-reaching repercussions, the scale of which is unmatched in the history of mankind. They range from multi-purpose water conservancy projects to renewable energy projects and inter-provincial railway construction. These projects have been conceived for decades yet highly controversial and expensive to build. Meanwhile, China has made a commitment that it will shoulder the responsibility of implementing the 2030 development agenda (17 Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs), and seek solidarity and cooperation to constantly push the cause of global development. This course gives students a general background of these mega-projects, the problems they attempt to resolve, benefits, as well as how these projects trying to meet the SDGs (especially the SDGs 6, 7 and 13 of water scarcity, affordable clean energy and climate actions, respectively), and the potential collaborations with other countries contributing to human well-being. After taking this course, students should have a comprehensive understanding about the occurrence, nature and sustainable solutions of the various environmental problems China is facing.",

      "description": "Globalization processes have been affecting every nook and corner of the world. We are all fascinated by the mushrooming of transnational companies; the increasing cross-boundary flows of resources as well as the increasing competition among places and cities. Resource becomes a keen issue due to the growth of population, trade and economy in the age of globalization. Good management of resources will thus be both global and local concerns. In this regard and with the advent of the global agenda 2030, there is increasing enthusiasm in addressing the most pressing and challenging issues that the world is facing today, and these are Globalization and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThis course will thus focus on the interaction of man and environment in a geographical context with special reference to a selection of relevant SDGs. By adopting different perspectives, a variety of resource issues ranging from natural resources to economic and human resources will be examined. The course will be divided into two parts. The first part will be the discussion of basic concepts of globalization and resource issues in the society that are related to selected SDGs. The second part will be issue-based analyses of different resource issues that affect lives in modern societies and that could make a difference in the pursuit of the SDGs particularly in this age of globalization. Various cases in the real world will be analyzed. This course will help students to broaden their views on the SDGs and understand the importance and implications of resource issues in both developing and developed countries.",

What are the disasters caused by a hazard and how do people respond? How to manage various types of natural hazards which affect the sustainability of urban and rural development? Students will find enormous interest in seeking answers to these questions.\n\nThis course examines the physical and human dimensions of natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, landslides, tropical cyclones, floods and droughts. Through a variety of teaching and learning activities, this course will help students understand major natural hazards from a regional perspective, in terms of their causes, location and distribution, human responses to prepare, prevent and mitigate their impacts on sustainable development.\n\nEffective management and mitigation of natural hazards are essential for building safe, resilient, and sustainable cities (SDG11) and for combating and adapting to climate change (SDG13). This course provides students with real-life examples that help students understand the relevant economic, social and environmental issues caused by natural hazards. The knowledge empowers students to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation measures to minimise the impact on people, contributing to more resilient and sustainable societies.\n\nStudy of the interaction between society and natural hazards will help students better understand the man-environment relationship. An issue-based approach from a topical perspective is adopted to address a wide variety of geological, meteorological, and hydrological hazards. The importance of geographical regions in understanding natural hazards and their socio-economic impacts is highlighted throughout the course. Case studies of occurrences and natural hazard management in Hong Kong and other parts of the world are emphasized.",

Yet, few people really understand their formation and presence. This course introduces students to the concepts and processes of environmental change, such as climate change, land use change, desertification, and habitat loss.\n\nThe course adopts a scientific approach to help students understand the processes of environmental change behind some of the planet’s famous natural landscapes, landforms and natural phenomena. These shall include the natural processes (geological, atmospheric, hydrological and ecological) and anthropogenic processes (land use change, fossil fuel combustion and infrastructure development).\n\nThe course is designed around the four themes of: (i) the processes and patterns of landscape formation; (ii) the combination of natural and human-induced environmental change; (iii) benefits of natural wonders to human beings; and (iv) the methods and challenges of protecting natural wonders.\n\nThis course will cover at least three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), namely SDG13 Climate Action, SDG14 Life Below Water, and SDG15 Life On Land. The impact of climate change on various natural wonders and related human well-being will be examined, along with possible ways to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Also, the influence of human activities on terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as well as possible options for their sustainable management will be discussed.",

After the completion of Human Genome Project, scientists have already unraveled some of the mysteries of how genes manipulate our life. Biotechnology, the use of living organisms to make products, has already led to the new industrial revolution, which creates hundreds of thousand jobs and tens of billion dollars revenue in the United States. This course aims to introduce students some fundamental knowledge of how genes determine and control our appearance and behaviour. Recent discoveries of some genes in inheritable diseases (e.g. cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, etc.), aging and death will be addressed. Successful examples of using biotechnology to improve our medicinal, agricultural and environmental practices will be introduced. Some ethical, legal and social issues generated from genetic research and biotechnology will also be discussed. This course is particularly suitable to those students who are not life science majors but want to understand more on the recent research on human genome and biotechnology, and their impacts on our future worlds.",

      "course_syllabus": "This course is basically composed of **FOUR** modules:\n\n* *I. THE BASICS**\n\n* **Biology, Facts, and the Scientific Method***\n\nBiology is the study of life. The facts in biology are really attempts to state our current understanding of the natural world around us, based on observations that we make and experiments that we do. Biology is rich with examples of facts that were once widely held but have since been superseded as biologists have tramped on to a better understanding of the phenomena those facts attempted to explain. Biologists, as well as other scientists, have made new and better information available with a systematic approach called the scientific method. In this lesson, brief history of the emergence of modern biology will be introduced. Renowned scientists and how they have contributed to the discovery of cell and DNA using the scientific method are introduced, so that the students can get a sense of what the scientific endeavour is like.\n\n* **Cell: A Basic Unit of Life***\n\nCell is the basic unit of living organisms. Cells are not static but are dynamic in nature. They have the capacity to grow, to response to stimuli, to adapt to environmental changes, to become differentiated and specialized, and most importantly, they can duplicate themselves exactly by divisions. Nearly all the genetic information needed to direct these activities are contained within the chemical **deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** inside the nucleus. During this lecture, some structural, functional and genetic characteristics of a living cell will be introduced.\n\n* **The Central Dogma of Directional Flow of Genetic Information***\n\nDNA from all organisms is made up of the same chemical and physical components. The DNA sequence is the particular side-by-side arrangement of bases along the DNA strand. This order spells out the exact instructions required to create a particular organism with its own unique traits. The **genome** is an organism's complete set of DNA, and the DNA in the human genome is arranged into 24 distinct **chromosomes.** Each chromosome contains many genes, the basic physical and functional units of heredity. **Genes** are specific sequences of bases that encode instructions on how to make proteins. Although genes get a lot of attention, it is the **proteins** that perform most life functions and even make up the majority of cellular structures. In this lesson, the central dogma of directional flow of genetic information will be addressed, which provides the background knowledge for the following lectures.\n\n* **The Book of Life***\n\nThe **Human Genome Project (HGP)** is an international research programme, involving more than 2000 scientists at 20 institutions in 6 countries, to characterize the genomes of humans and other organisms, to develop novel technologies for achieving the goals, and to address the ethical, legal and social impacts of this new information. Although the possibility of sequencing human genome was first discussed in the mid-1980s, the project was only officially started in 1990. After a 13-year work, which is 2 years shorter than it was initially expected, the finalized sequence of the human genome, with 99.99% accuracy, was publicly announced on 14 April, 2003. Some of the novel insights and interesting findings about the human genome will be addressed in this lecture.\n\n* *II. ETHICAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES**\n\nAcoin has two sides. Although human genome research and biotechnology improve our living quality, they also introduce us some ethical, legal and social problems that greatly attract public attentions and worldwide debates. Some of these foreseeable issues will be discussed, including:\n\n* **Privacy, confidentiality and fairness in the use of genetic information***\n\nWho should have access to personal genetic information, e.g. employers, courts, schools, government agencies, etc.? How will it be used?\n\n* **Commercialization of genetic information and its products***\n\nShould the genetic information donors or the commercial companies own the property rights of the developed products?\n\n* **Psychological impact, stigmatization, and discrimination***\n\nHow does personal genetic information affect self-identity and society's perceptions?\n\n* **Uncertainties associated with gene tests for susceptibilities and complex conditions***\n\nShould testing be performed when no treatment is available? Should children be tested for susceptibility to adult-onset diseases?\n\n* **Health and environmental issues***\n\nAre genetically modified (GM) foods and other products safe for human and the environment? How will these technologies affect developing nations' dependence on industrialized nations?\n\n* *III. GENES, HEALTH, AND DISEASES**\n\nModern genetics has had a profound impact on medicine. Although connections between certain diseases and inheritance were made centuries ago, only during the past decades that geneticists become understood the metabolic basis of several hundred inherited disorders. Detective genes that result in the inherited disorders have been isolated. The genes in normal individuals are called wild-type genes; those with defects that result in the synthesis of nonfunctional products are called mutant genes. They result in abnormal or mutant conditions. These detects in mutant genes are called mutations. In this lecture, some of the better-characterized genetic diseases will be introduced, and the connections between gene mutations and inheritable diseases will be addressed:\n\n* **What Causes Cancer? How Cancer Arises?***\n\nCancer is one of the leading causes of mortality in our society. Incidence and development of cancer is affected by both heritable gene mutations and environment (including our living lifestyles). Recent studies have shown that cancer is a result of unnecessary cell divisions and resistance to proper cell death. Although gene mutations cannot be prohibited, improving our living quality can markedly reduce the incidence of cancer. Recent knowledge on the causes and development of cancer will be introduced, and some preventive living practices and the recent and prosperous future curative methods will also be discussed during the lesson.\n\n* **Why Do We Age?***\n\nAging is the chronological process of an individual's life along a time axis, and senescence is the deterioration process associated with aging. Aging cannot be halted but senescence can be slowed down. Several theories accounting for the significance of individual's aging to the population will be introduced in this lesson. Moreover, some classical studies showing causes of senescence and corresponding ways to slow down the process will also be discussed. Results of these studies have already paved the route of development a number of so called \"anti-aging\" nutraceuticals or food supplements in our market. Finally, a genetic disease called Werner Syndrome, which is caused by the mutations of *WRN* gene and pre-mature senescence, will also be addressed.\n\n* *IV. BIOTECHNOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY IN DAILY LIVINGS**\n\n* **Biotechnology for Improving Our Quality of Life***\n\nNowadays, researchers can cut apart the genome to figure out what the individual parts do. They can make changes to a gene and replace one gene with another. This \"cutting and pasting\" is called genetic engineering, which is the heart of a whole new industry called **biotechnology**, the use of living things to make products. While many biotechnology creations are still in the experimental stage, a number of them are already on the market. During the lecture, some of the successful examples of using biotechnology to improve our medicinal and agricultural practices will be introduced, e.g. replacement of genes for repairing the genetic defects, duplication of organisms as donors of tissues and organs for transplantation, engineering of some crops to make them more resistant to insects and diseases, creation of new crops with bigger harvest or containing more proteins so that they are more nutritious, etc.\n\n* **Molecular Biology for Finding the Truth***\n\nCourt cases hinge on scientific evidence, and forensic science serves as an interface between law and science. Instead of depending solely on the smudged fingerprints left at the scene of a crime, because of the advancement of molecular biology, investigators could now look at a new kind of \"fingerprints\" called DNA fingerprints, which is the unique signature found in each person's genetic makeup. This DNA-fingerprinting technology, which has been regarded as a revolutionary tool in forensic science, has already helped a number of court cases to condemn the guilty or to exonerate the innocent. In this lecture, the theory and procedures in preparing the DNA fingerprints and its analysis will be introduced. Some of the best-known cases involving DNA evidence will also be considered, as an illustration of the value and vulnerability of using DNA as evidence.",

      "description": "The Earth is an intricate and fragile system. Slight differences in the terrain of neighbouring areas on the Earth can lead to variations in climate, geology, and marine resources. The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is located in the southern coastal area of China and has a subtropical climate influenced by the East Asian Monsoon. Two cities of the GBA, Hong Kong and Shenzhen, are geographically neighbours on the eastern side of the Pearl River estuary. Still, the interaction of oceanic, geologic, and atmospheric systems has shaped their local weather patterns and influenced the availability and distribution of natural resources.\nThis course highlights the geophysics, macroclimate, and marine science of the GBA and the microclimate in Hong Kong’s and Shenzhen’s areas. It aims to engage students in exploring the interconnectedness of the Earth and the sky through interdisciplinary subjects, thereby reflecting on human responsibilities to the natural environment, including the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems and the sustainable use of marine resources. The topics to be covered include the physics of meteorology, the principles of geology, astronomical relevance to climate, human influence on long-term climate, and natural disasters.

      "description": "Throughout human history, we have developed different ways to strive for living in nature. Among which, agriculture is the foundation of all sedentary civilizations as it systematically provides food and other products to sustain human lives. It is an art that integrates knowledge of nature with human needs and values, evolving side by side with the development of science and technology. Today, with the advancement of scientific technology, the highly industrialized modern agriculture has greatly increased food production to support the global population growth. Yet it also brings global ethical concerns regarding sustainability, food safety, biotechnology, pollution, etc. In the past decades, increasing attention has been given to permaculture, an alternative agricultural practice that emphasizes the development of durable and self-sufficient ecosystems in farming. Permaculture is not only a practice of sustainable food production, it is also a philosophy of living with nature.\n\nIn this course, students will learn through lectures the basic knowledge about modern agriculture and its applications of science and technology; understand the fundamental principles, philosophy, and practice of permaculture; discuss the ethical issues related to the use of science and technology in modern agriculture; reflect on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, such as “Zero Hunger”, “Affordable and Clean Energy”, “Sustainable Cities and Communities”, and “Responsible Consumption and Reproduction”. Students will also experience the practices of modern agriculture and permaculture by making site-visits to enterprises of the agricultural industry, and to institutes practicing permaculture. Students who finish this course will be able to describe and compare the major principles and practices of modern agriculture and those of permaculture, analyze the ethical issues related to modern agriculture in contemporary societies, and formulate personal views on how to live more ethically with nature.",

In contrast to modern agriculture, permaculture promotes high-science and low-technology. The following issues about permaculture will be covered:\n\n– Basics principles of permaculture\n\n– Philosophy of living with nature\n\n– Practical knowledge of permaculture\n\nStudents’ understanding of permaculture will be reinforced by site-visits and hand-on practice in permaculture institutes.\n\n* *(3) Agricultural ethics**\n\nModern agriculture has brought not only increased food supply, but also global concerns of ethical issues. The following issues will be covered:\n\n– Sustainability and SDGs\n\n– Food safety\n\n– Biotechnology\n\n– Pollution\n\nStudents will learn the agricultural ethics related to the use of science and technology in modern agriculture. By comparing modern agriculture and permaculture, students will be able to reflect on the ethical issues in modern agriculture and ponder on how an ethical way of living with nature can be developed. Students will also reflect on sustainability related to SDG #2 “Zero Hunger”, SDG #7 “Affordable and Clean Energy”, SDG #11 “Sustainable Cities and Communities”, SDG #12 “Responsible Consumption and Reproduction”, SDG #13 “Climate Change”, SDG #14 “Life below Water” and SDG #15 “Life on Land”. The reflection will be deepened by the site-visits to the modern farmlands and permaculture institutes, and group discussion with the course instructor and classmates.\n\nThe courses will be designed in three parts:\n\nPart I Lectures in CUHK\n\n– Two whole-day lectures will be given to introduce the three main topics mentioned above. Students are required to take a quiz after the lectures.\n\nPart II Study-trip\n\n– By experiencing modern agriculture and permaculture in real-life situations and hand-on practices, students will understand better the situations, dilemmas and ethical issues of global concern regarding modern agriculture. A six-day study-trip visiting modern farmlands and permaculture institutes will be organized to deepen students’ understanding and reflection on the three main topics mentioned above. In the study-trip, there will be site-visits, talks, practices and discussion sessions covering modern agriculture, permaculture, agricultural ethics and SDGs.\n\n– Australia is at the top priority for the study-trip because she has well-established modern agriculture industry and permaculture practice. She is also the origin of permaculture. Taiwan is the second priority for the trip because it also has good modern agriculture industry and permaculture practice, although the scale is smaller than Australia. Due to the increasing popularity of permaculture worldwide, other countries and regions with good permaculture practices will also be considered..\n\nPart III Seminar in CUHK\n\n– A seminar will be organised to consolidate the ideas covered in the lectures and the study-trip. Students are required to give group presentations to apply what they have learnt in the lectures and the trip. They are required to write individual final paper afterwards.",

      "terms": [],
      "description": "Environmental protection is an important part of modern civilization for the fact that human life and the sustainable development of society are based on natural resources from the environment. While there are common principles and practices for protecting the environment, local contexts might add to the intricacy between humans and their environment, and thus create multiple perspectives for intellectual pursuits. For example, cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) share and enjoy a lot of marine resources in the Pearl River Delta. However, coastal cities in the GBA, including Hong Kong and Shenzhen have been heavily impacted by pollution arising from rapid economic transformations and industrial developments in the last few decades. For such a global issue, concerted efforts have been made in scientific studies, implementation of international policies and strengthening of local governance to restore the damaged environment and properly manage our natural resources. Progress has been made but environmental issues remain a huge challenge to mankind.\n\nThis course aims to engage students in re-examining some current strategies for environmental protection at national, regional, local and even personal levels, by guiding them to study selected prevailing environmental problems, general practices of the society and some representative interregional collaborations in the GBA. While general principles in environmental science will be outlined, this course will focus on water resources, management of pollution in the coastal area and regional collaborations upon the issues. To gain first-hand experience in the present situation of their own city and neighbouring regions, students from CUHK and CUHK(SZ) will participate in field trips and scientific investigations. Tutorial discussions and writing assignments are learning opportunities for students to reflect on and evaluate the implementation of current environmental policies and interregional collaborations in the Greater Bay Area, in terms of the possibilities those policies and collaborations have brought, their significance and issues arising from them. The course serves as a platform across human experience and knowledge for students to exchange ideas, propose new ideas and embark on the journey to a better world as local inhabitants and global citizens.",

      "description": "This course is designed to educate students with little or no technical background and experience to have a general understanding and a fun learning experience of the charismatic subject of robots. Our society is on the verge of a new era of technology convergence: robotic devices are envisioned to become a nearly ubiquitous part of our day-to-day lives. New technologies such as wireless communication and voice and visual recognition will make robots become behaviour-based, cognitive and biologically inspired humanoids. Fundamental social, economical, and technological issues of a human-machine society will be identified and discussed in interactive sessions. This learning process transcends the conventional boundaries between technology and other disciplines, and it is facilitated with a series of demonstrative sessions which present students with opportunities to observe, evaluate, examine, and interact with a variety of commercial robots and humanoids. Guided by internal and external experts, students will also focus on a specific social, business or technology issue, identifying and exploring potential solutions with robotic and automation technology that could potentially impact the quality of our life. In this exploration process, students are encouraged to apply their personal background and interest to conceive and experiment with the aid of popular robot kits. The course will cultivate students with enriched perspectives of a future society.",

      "description": "Biology is the study of life. Complex life is built from some molecules that slowly evolved into diverse living organisms, which then interact with the environment to form ecosystems and finally shape the biosphere where we all live in. Studies of the biological world allow us to understand more on how life has evolved and lead to significant advancement in our ability to improve living quality, but at the same time create a lot of controversies and problems. This course firstly aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive view on the biological world, starting from the simplest DNA to simple single-celled organisms, and then to more complicated living organisms, and finally to the most complex ecosystems and biosphere; and to guide students to appreciate the Wonders and majesty of the biological world. Students will also be introduced examples of how insights from studying the biological world can improve our health, living quality and environment, and may affect the future societal development. Students will be introduced to examples that are relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals including SDG #3 “Good Heath and Well Being, SDG #7 “Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG #13 “Climate Action” and SDG #15 “Life on Land”. The important roles of biotechnology will be discussed, such as how human diseases can be prevented and treated, and how global climate change can be mitigated.",

      "description": "In modern cities, a wide assortment of food products is available in the markets and consumers are able to enjoy these delicious foods conveniently and safely. Behind the scenes of food enjoyment, lots of science and technology has been applied in their manufacturing processes to ensure that the food products are preserved in high standards of quality, nutrition and safety. Among those food manufacturing and processing methods, however, some of them are quite controversial and thus arouse many public concerns over food safety and security issues.\n\nThis course is designed for the general students to provide them with some key concepts and scientific knowledge in food preservation, processing technology and food safety control, as well as to explore the interactive relationships between them. Through learning the basic properties of foodborne hazards, which are the origins of most food safety problems, students are able to enhance the understandings on the principles and practices of respective food preservation methods and processing technologies. Meanwhile, the potential risks and adverse effects of particular food processing technologies will be discussed. Furthermore, some highly concerning topics and incidents about food safety will be analysed based on scientific facts and discussed from different perspectives. After finishing the course, students are encouraged to use the acquired knowledge to make better food choices, distinguish the fallacies about food and appraise the impact of modern technology on human food safety and security.",

Biodiversity, conservation, environmental management, and related technologies are essential and are brought together under this bigger theme of sustainability. Biotechnology, here thus plays a great role, as it infiltrates in different part of our lives — from the food we eat to how we collect them, the drugs we take to treat illnesses, the fuel we use to power up devices and even the conservation of biodiversity and the environmental health. While biotechnology is a broad discipline that exploits different biological processes, organisms, cells or cellular components to develop new and effective technologies and is a newly emerged and an ongoing field in biological sciences, it offers opportunities to aid achieving different global matters that are happening currently or in the foreseeable future, especially issues relating but not limited to food crisis, one health, energy shortage, sustainable infrastructure and biodiversity in different habitats, etc.\n\nThis course provides a wide scope of knowledge relating to biotechnology that aims to stimulate thoughts and broaden the horizon of students from different background. It also allows the students to embrace the beauty and understand the constraint, including ethical, social, environmental and technological challenges of biotechnology. This course focuses on three major themes: 1). Introduction of the basic biotechnology knowledge of genetics and extended biotechnology techniques, 2). Showcases of the latest biotechnological developments and applications in various aspects of life sciences, 3). Discussion of key values of biotechnology and the philosophical, moral and ethical issues of biotechnology. Ultimately, this course aims at raising the awareness and promote the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are related to SDG#2 Zero Hunger, SDG#3 Good Health and Well-being, SDG#7 Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG#9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG#11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG#14 Life Below Water and SDG#15 Life On Land, to the students.",

The formation of astronomical structures (galaxy clusters, galaxies, stars).\n4. The appearance of heavy elements in various stages of star evolution.\n5. The formation of planets.\n6. The appearance of simple and complicated molecules.\n7. The emergence of elementary life forms.\n8. The process of evolution on Earth and history of life.\nThe brief overview of all these steps will provide the students with a mental map of how different pieces fit into the big picture.\n\nThen some of the major topics will be discussed in depth. For each of those chosen topics, the discussion will be about what the latest understanding is, and how we arrived at the understanding. The latter part will focus on the logical arguments in understanding observations and experiments, so that the students can develop a solid understanding of how scientific method is applied throughout the process.\n\nIn particular, the topics which would be covered in depth are Topics 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8. They are chosen because we understand them the best, and because all of them can be explained in relatively simple way to non-experts.\n\nFinally, the course will cover some latest developments of the research on the various steps. Some of the results could be more speculative, and would lead to some open questions for the students. If time permits, the course will also cover some topics about the implications of the whole “story”, e.g., are we alone in the universe?",

      "description": "Hong Kong is very famous for its superb cuisine, which is a fantastic fusion of eastern and western styles.\nCooking is both an art and a science. Good tasting foods and drinks are the results of perfect matches of ingredients and cooking methods. Foods and drinks is related to chemistry closely. Having some understanding about the chemistry of the food ingredients and the various cooking methods can help appreciating the connections between science and human life. This course will discuss the Hong Kong cuisine culture from the chemistry perspective, to explain why these famous foods and drinks are so tasty and popular. Examples include Chinese rotisserie (Siu Mei), wonton noodles, steamed seafoods, stewed beef brisket, silk stocking milk tea, and century egg with pickled ginger, etc. Consuming food and soups that carry health and therapeutic values is also a unique food culture in China and Southeast Asia. The course will introduce several types of food that are traditionally considered to have some specific functions, and discuss their scientific justifications from the chemistry point of views. Besides, pre-packaged food and fast food is an important eating culture of modern urban people. Some important issues about pre-packaged food and fast food, such as food storage and packaging, uses of approved (and sometimes prohibited) food additives, alternative ingredients, and food testing, will also be discussed.",

This course investigates long-term evolutionary perspectives on the human species. The basics of evolution and natural selection as scientific theories are clearly set out and examined, and common misconceptions discussed. Evidence for the evolution of mammals and primates is reviewed and discussed, and the common characteristics of these species are highlighted, demonstrating the connections between humans and other forms of life. The course covers what we know about human ancestors and the evolution of modern humans. Students are introduced to the wide range of human adaptations to local conditions across contemporary cultures and the variety of relationships that human populations have with the environment. Students are encouraged to use the knowledge they have acquired to ask: are these relationships always sustainable? Looking to the future: what are our responsibilities both to future generations of humans and towards other species with which we share our world? This course aims to give students an understanding and appreciation of evolutionary perspectives on the place of humans in the world, the variety of contemporary human societies, and a broad perspective on the complexity of the relationship between humans, the environment and other species.",

Archaeology is a dynamic discipline that has tremendously expanded our knowledge about the past, but this subject is not just about digging and doing fieldwork. A wide range of new techniques (e.g., metallurgy, zoology, and 3d stimulation) and research methods have been incorporated into current archaeological research, and eventually transformed the understanding of ourselves and our culture in many ways. This course provides a general introduction in terms of two specific domains:\n1) basic archaeological science that changed the research paradigm of human culture and history; 2) an overall history about ancient technology illustrated by new research techniques to explain how this modern world took shape. Moreover, this course provides hands-on practice to cultivate students’ cross-disciplinary research skills and prepare them for the arrival of a new, digitalized research era.",

      "course_syllabus": "The course is roughly divided into two blocks with the first half mainly introducing the perpetuation of life and maintenance of the life processes and the second half emphasizing more on the health issues and physical disorders. All lectures will be conducted by teachers from the School of Biomedical Sciences. Each lecture will start by introducing some basic knowledge of the topics and then move into relating its relevance to the understanding of disease conditions. The impact of some latest advances in medical sciences on mankind will also be discussed.\n\n* *Perpetuation of life and maintenance of life processes**\n\nMedical sciences help us to better understand the upholding of the healthy, normal status of our body. The seven lectures in this area will illustrate the general anatomical and physiological concepts for understanding the sophisticated yet highly coordinated mechanisms involved in the conception of life and normal functioning of the human body.\n\n* *Topics include:**\n\n| ***Topics*** | ***Learning Contents*** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Fertility and infertility** | Reproduction is essential for the continued existence of a species. This lecture provides a brief overview on the physiological control of gamete production in men and women, and various factors that determine fertility and contribute towards infertility. Various methods of contraception and how they work will be introduced. |\n| **Miracle of life** | This lecture gives an account of the human reproductive system and the prenatal development of the human embryo inside mother’s womb. It covers the human embryonic development starting from a fertilized egg which then grows to a cluster of cells and gradually changes and develops into a fetus during pregnancy. It also touches on test-tube baby and techniques for assisted reproduction. |\n| **A beautiful mind: wonders of the brain** | Our memories, emotions and actions determine who we are. All these are functions of the brain and this lecture will reveal the important features of this mysterious anatomical structure. |\n| **Body composition and body fluid** | Water makes up of about 60% of our body weight. The various functions of water in humans and the physiological regulation of total body water volume and its contents will be outlined. |\n| **Cardiovascular diseases and treatments** | Cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and ischemic heart diseases are the most prevalent medical conditions in the Western society. This lecture will briefly cover the organization and physiological control of the cardiovascular system. Besides, the common causes of cardiovascular diseases and the basis of current drug treatments will be introduced. |\n| **Wireless control in our body: hormones** | Hormones are chemical messengers which act as wireless control of life processes in the human body. Travelling from the site of synthesis to distant target tissues or organs via the bloodstream, hormones can exert widespread influences over a long distance. In this lecture, the control and function of various endocrine systems, as well as the causes and symptoms of common endocrine diseases will be discussed. |\n| **Life at the extremes** | Majority of the human population live in areas close to sea level. The body is highly adapted to the air pressure and oxygen content at this altitude. When a lowlander ascends, the pressure becomes lower and oxygen content reduces, body has to adapt to this new environment. A highlander lives at high altitude for thousands of years and their physical performance is much better than a fully adapted lowlander. The physiological and genetic adaptation process will be described. |\n\n* *Health issues and physical disorders**\n\nAn understanding of the body defense system and disease mechanisms is important for the maintenance of health and the choice of effective treatments. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in physical disorders induced by deterioration of normal physiological functions or by exposure of the body to foreign substances/organisms will be examined.\n\n* *Topics included:**\n\n| ***Topics*** | ***Learning Contents*** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Body defense** | Our defense system is a body-wide network consisting of organs, tissues, cells, and small molecules that work together to fight against “foreign” invaders and different kinds of stressors. This lecture aims to introduce the mechanism of body defense and response to infection as one source of body immune reaction. The common hospital-acquired infections and epidemiology will also be discussed. |\n| **Targeting our genes** | In human, genetic codes are stored in DNA. The human genome contains 3 billion base pairs of nucleotides. Any mutations in the DNA sequence may lead to genetic diseases. The goal of the Human Genome Project is to determine the complete DNA sequence in human. In this lecture, basic knowledge of genetics as well as the causes of genetic diseases will be introduced, and the importance of the human genome project in the study of genetic diseases will be discussed. Enormous progress on genome editing has been made in the past few years. The genome editing tools and prospects of this technology will also be discussed. |\n| **Avoiding the top killer - cancer** | Cancer is a major killer disease that has long haunted mankind. Carcinogenesis refers to the development of cancerous cells from normal cells. In this lecture, different causes of carcinogenesis and the impact of human activities on the development of cancer will be discussed. |\n| **Drugs that we take** | This lecture aims to provide students with a basic understanding on what are drugs, how they are discovered, and how they work. General pharmacological principles which are important for understanding the proper use of drugs as medicines will be discussed. Drug abuse and its harmful effects will also be described. |\n| **Healthy aging** | Aging is a natural process that causes a gradual slowdown of body function and increases the risk of developing diseases. This lecture will explore the effects of aging on different body functions and discuss the strategies that can be used to delay the process of aging and prepare the body and mind for a healthy aging. |",

All animals begin life as a fertilized egg. After several round of cell division, the fertilized egg will develop into an embryo, and then a fetus. During development, stem cells can differentiate into different types of cells in our body. Each cell inherits the same set of DNA, but only selected genes are activated. However, any error in the genetic code will result in defects and pathological changes. Currently, prenatal diagnosis and genetic disease tests are employed to detect these defects. With the diagnosis of such defects, we could devise therapeutic interventions or other treatment regimens to minimize the impacts of these defects. Besides genetic diseases, some common problems might also arise during childhood development, like hearing and speech impairment, visual impairment, delay for motor skills, and mental retardation.\n\n* *1.****Prenatal diagnosis and genetic disease tests**\n\nThe genetic code is hidden in DNA. The genetic information stored in the DNA sequence is transferred through mRNA and then finally to proteins. When there are mutations in the DNA sequences, genetic diseases may arise. Prenatal diagnosis is very important in increasing the chance of delivering a healthy baby.\n\n* *2.****Stem cells and tissue regeneration**\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2012 was awarded to Sir John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent stem cells. This discovery is an important breakthrough in medicinal research. In this lecture, the definition and characteristics of stem cells will be introduced. Methods for stem cell preparation and the potential applications of stem cells for medical therapy will be explained. Current problems and ethical issues on stem cell usage will be discussed.\n\n* *3.****Sense and sensibility**\n\nThe molecular and cellular basis of different sensation will be introduced. Common sensory disorders and the effects on childhood development will be explained. Current advances in diagnosis and treatment will be discussed.\n\n* **B******.******Growing up***\n\nThe immune system in our body helps to protect us against disease by identifying and killing any pathogens from entering the body. However, over-reactivity of this life-saving system will cause allergy that will make troubles for us. Allergic diseases that are commonly found in Hong Kong, like rhinitis and asthma, will be introduced.\n\nBeside allergic diseases, other problems may arise when we grow up from childhood and enter into adulthood. In the past, under-nutrition is a problem in many parts of the world. Nowadays, the problems of over-nutrition and unbalanced diet are becoming more serious in many countries.\n\nCoupled with the lack of exercise, obesity is a common problem among many working adults in Kong Kong. Also, a stressful working environment together with the bacterial infection has made gastric problems commonplace in Hong Kong. If we continue to neglect the warning signals from our bodies, we may finally suffer from lethal organ failure.\n\n* *1.****Allergy**\n\nThe immune system protects us against disease by killing the pathogens that enter our body. Disorders of immune system occur when the immune response is hypersensitive, or lacking. Allergy is an immune response excited by allergens. Allergens that are commonly found in Hong Kong include house dust mite, cockroaches, and house moulds.\n\n* *2****. Obesity**\n\nThis topic will discuss diet, energy balance, healthy body weight, life styles, genetics and environmental factors in relation to overweight and obesity. It will also emphasize how obesity increases the risk of chronic diseases. The methods to treat obesity will be briefly introduced, including dietary intervention, behavior modification, medications and surgery.\n\n* *3.****Gastric problems**\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology & Medicine for 2005 was awarded to Barry J. Marshall and J. Robin Warren for establishment of the linkage between *Helicobacter pylori* and gastric diseases. The bacteria colonized in the stomach induce many changes in gastric secretion. This topic will address the basic science and clinical manifestation of gastric diseases.\n\n* **C.******The invaders***\n\nThe human race is in a state of constant battle with our environment. This struggle for survival includes the fight against microorganisms in the environment. In the past, bacterial infections caused much mortality and morbidity to the human race. With the development of antibiotics, this problem is now under control. However, we are less successful in the development of effective anti-viral drugs. Thus, viral infection has become a serious problem. In this part, three viral infected diseases will be introduced. These include influenza (caused by influenza virus), hepatitis B (caused by hepatitis B virus), and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (caused by human immunodeficiency virus).\n\n* *1.****Hepatitis B and liver cancer**\n\nIn Hong Kong, it was estimated that about 10% of the whole population are hepatitis B carriers. The long-term consequences of chronic viral hepatitis infection include liver cancer, chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis. Local studies showed that approximately 80% of patients with liver cancer were hepatitis B carriers. In this module, the relationship between hepatitis B virus and liver diseases will be explored.\n\n* *2.****Influenza**\n\nThe annual epidemic and the potential threat of a pandemic render influenza a major infectious disease in the world. Effective control of influenza entails a combination of good sanitary habits and the employment of effective vaccines, diagnostic tests and antiviral drugs.\n\n* *3.****HIV and AIDS**\n\nAcquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. According to the statistics from the World Health Organization, AIDS accounts for the highest number of deaths in the world. In this module, the structure and organization of HIV, the route of transmission of AIDS, as well as the diagnosis and therapy of AIDS will be discussed.\n\n* **D.******Growing old***\n\nAging is a natural process of all human beings. Associated with aging, many physiological aspects of the body would start to deteriorate. These include the deterioration of joint functions (which will lead to arthritis), bone functions (which will lead to the development of osteoporosis), and brain functions (which will lead to the development of Alzheimer’s disease). The proper management of these conditions is a concern for the aging population.\n\n* *1.****Arthritis**\n\nArthritis is a major burden of mobility for the elderly. The development of arthritis is a multifactorial process. This topic will introduce the basic science and the clinical treatment for the disease.\n\n* *2.****Osteoporosis**\n\nOsteoporosis is one of the most common health problems among the elderly, characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissues leading to increased bone fragility and fracture risk. In this topic, the causes, preventive measurements and treatments of osteoporosis will be discussed.\n\n* *3.****Alzheimer’s disease**\n\nThe molecular basis of interneuron communication (neurotransmission) will be introduced. Clinical signs and problems of the aged brain will be explained. Advances in understanding and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease will be discussed.",

      "description": "One in every 10 people suffers from at least a kind of communication disorder. It is almost inevitable for people to have encountered individuals with unclear speech, hoarse voice, stuttering, autism spectrum disorder, hearing impairment and dementia etc. in their lifetime. Students without a background in speech and hearing sciences may not have solid understanding of the essentials of human communication and its disorders. This course thus aims to provide tailor-made content suiting all students to cover the fundamentals of these topics from the perspective of speech-language-pathology.\n\nThe course consists of 3 major components. The first one brings out the essential elements in normal communication. The second component covers what goes wrong in the chain of communication which leads to various communication disorders. The third component introduces various communication disorders in terms of the general characteristics and the practical tips on how to interact with them through case studies.\n\nBy learning the essential elements of effective communication skills as well as gaining knowledge on how to facilitate interaction with people who have diverse communication and educational needs, this course also helps students to better understand the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) relating to #3 Good Health and Well-being, #4 Inclusive Quality Education and #10 Reduced Inequalities.",

      "description": "A communication disorder is an impairment in the ability to receive, send, process, and comprehend concepts or verbal, nonverbal and graphic symbol systems. A communication disorder may be evident in the processes of hearing, language, and/or speech. A communication disorder may range in severity from mild to profound.\n\nSpecifically, speech and language impairment (SLI) refers to any one or combination of the following conditions that may lead to communication difficulties – a) speech sound disorders, b) voice disorders, c) fluency disorders, d) language disorders. Students with SLI may encounter difficulties in communicating effectively with others, which may affect one’s self-esteem and development of social relationships. They may have difficulties in understanding and / or giving oral presentations, struggle in following rapid verbal exchanges which may limit their participation in classes. They may also lack confidence in speaking in front of public or a large group of people. They may thus have trouble adapting to the course work and university life. This is partially attributable to the lack of awareness of SLI among university students and teachers.\n\nThe course aims to provide general education on knowledge and skills relating to daily communications with students with Speech and Language Impairment (SLI) in academic or social settings, and facilitate equal access to quality education.\n\nThis course is an SDG-GE course, which aims to promote good health and well-being in the university population, reduce inequality among students with different abilities, and thus facilitate equal access to quality education. The course also helps students to understand the social and economic considerations relevant to speech and language impairment (SLI).",

The main themes of the course include the ocean processes, the marine ecosystems and their inhabitants, and the relationships between oceans and mankind. Emphasis will be placed on how natural processes shape the oceans, how the inhabitants survive the marine environment, how we depend on the oceans, the impact of anthropogenic processes on the oceans, and how the future of mankind is affected by the oceans. Examples of topics covered include: the Earth and the oceans, ecosystems of the oceans, marine organisms and their adaptations to the marine environment, exploitation of the oceans, and the management and conservation of the oceans. Altogether, this course also aims to raise awareness and promote the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are related to SDG#13 Climate Action and SDG#14 Life Below Water. A laboratory visit to the Simon F.S. Li Marine Science Laboratory will be included to demonstrate the methodology and instruments used in marine research.",
