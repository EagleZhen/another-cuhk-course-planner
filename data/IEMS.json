It is also now one of the essential components in many online services, for example, to generate personalized recommendations on e-commerce platforms, perform face detection and recognition or predict the arrival time of delivery, etc. Given the widespread usage of machine learning, it is important that complex machine learning models can be deployed in an efficient way to support real time services at scale and to allow seamless update of the models. This course will first introduce fundamental concepts in the architecture of scalable internet-based services, distributed/network programming and infrastructure support for content delivery. It then goes on to introduce how scalable online services can be created and maintained, with a focus on services that involve machine learning. Topics will include asynchronous programming, distributed message queues and brokers, load balancers, micro-services, distributed caches and databases, and challenges and solutions in building and deploying various machine learning models/services in a production environment.Advisory note: Students are expected to have background in computer networking and machine learning.",
