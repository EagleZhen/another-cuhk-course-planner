      "description": "[This course is offered via asynchronous online mode. Students should register the course via KEEP, a CUHK eLearning platform where the course materials are uploaded.]This online course enables students to acquire some basics of Hong Kong Sign Language and the general principles for communicating with deaf people in a visual-gestural modality. With different videoed scenarios, students are systematically guided to acquire elementary signing skills for fulfilling basic communication needs in everyday situations. Emphasis will be placed on a range of simple, general-purpose expressions, which allow students to converse with local deaf people, as well as prepare themselves for learning the language further.",

CEFR profiles a learner’s language proficiency in a number of illustrative descriptors in six major levels (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2). The descriptors covers signing competences of sign language repertoire, diagrammatical accuracy, sociolinguistic appropriateness and cultural repertoire, sign text structure, setting and perspectives, language awareness and interpretation, presence and effect, processing speed, and signing fluency. Developing the competences at Level Pre-A1, students are treated as novice to Hong Kong Sign Language who are yet to acquire a generative capacity and will rely upon a repertoire of signs and formulaic expressions to\n● introduce themselves by fingerspelling their name and stating their hearing status;\n● use some basic greetings;\n● sign yes, no, thank you, sorry;\n● ask and tell time, day of the week, and month; and\n● make simple requests where pointing or other gesture serves to make reference to objects and events.",

To facilitate discussion, deaf and hearing guests will be invited to offer their unique perspectives on practical, educational and social aspects of being deaf.
