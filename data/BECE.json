On top of designing, implementation and evaluating the integrated activities for young children, students are required to conduct their classroom teaching through observation, assessment and reflection. In this course, the rationale of “assessment inform teaching” is highlighted. Students have to identify a problem in their classrooms and then design tailor-made classes based on theories and approaches which they have learnt in the programme. The concepts and practices on evaluation and reflection of the classroom teaching performance are emphasized. Students are expected to apply advanced strategies of classroom management and environment setting to respond to their teaching reflections.",
