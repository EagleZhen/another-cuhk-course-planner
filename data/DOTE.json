Students will be exposed to the problems and issues confronting operations managers in the business world today. Students will also be provided with the language, concepts, insights and tools to address operations management issues. How companies can gain competitive advantage through operations will be discussed. This course will emphasize applications rather than theories. However, the underlying logic of the concepts will be examined so that students can understand the principles upon which their approach is based.",

      "description": "The course begins by constructing a simplified model of the macro economy. This is intended to help organize your discussion of issues confronting an economy. Every opportunity is taken to reinforce the economic concepts with current data, particularly for the U.S. and China. We then proceed to examine the policy instruments used to steer an economy towards the objectives of sustainable growth, stable inflation and low unemployment. Broadly speaking, these policy tools are monetary policy, implemented by a country's central bank, and fiscal policy implemented by the government when it makes expenditure and taxation decisions. We extend our exposition of traditional monetary policy to explain the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing, as well as the essential factors contributing to the financial crisis which necessitated this unconventional monetary policy. We then move onto the interactions between economies as captured in their respective balance of payment accounts and exchange rate movements. Fluctuations in China's RMB will be closely analyzed at this point and open the door for an in-depth look into China's domestic imbalances. We also examine Hong Kong's unique currency board system under-pinning our linked exchange rate.",

Time-series analyses aim to explain the important influence of time-dependence in making economical predictions. Regression models cover CAPM as well as multifactor models to connote the cross-section relations among financial returns. GARCH and other volatility models introduce the related applications in risk management context. The course involves extensive use of real data examples and hands-on examples.",

The advances of information technology have given business strategies a new dimension: building computer-mediated networks to facilitate transactions over e-platforms. The examples include Amazon, Google, Spotify, iTunes, Alibaba, Uber, Airbnb, and many other B2B, B2C, and C2C platforms. The e-platform business has network effect following demand-side scale economies that sees the value of a product from the willingness-to-pay of customers. This creates new perspectives of business strategies on pricing, platform products, envelopment attacks, winner-takes-all effect, and cannibalization. This course discusses how to run a successful business with e-platforms.",

For each system we study its objective, structure, and actual performance. We will focus on the theoretical aspects of these systems, but will also examine empirical findings on how well they function. The second half of course surveys modern methods of applied micro-econometric research. We will begin by reviewing the Rubin Causal Model, its relationship with structural models, and the econometric definition of identification. We will then proceed to consider a number of econometric estimators, research designs, and inferential methods.",

In the past, business intelligence used to be in the domain of IT specialists. With the advent of self-service data visualization and business intelligence tools, such as Excel BI toolkit, now anyone with adequate training can produce their own analyses with minimal support from central IT. The aim of this course is to introduce to students the Excel BI toolkit that has become an integral part of Excel since Excel 2013. Designed to handle very large amount of data, the toolkit consists of four add-ins, namely, Power Query, Power Pivot, Power View, and Power Map. Students will learn how to use these add-ins to gain business intelligence. Students who are interested in taking this course are expected to have at least intermediate level and preferably advanced level of Excel skills.",

      "description": "Advance in information technology has already started a revolution in the financial industry. Every part of the financial service system is affected, from daily payment to long-term investment, from efficiency gain to logic transformation. The pace of change is fast. Too fast to catch, yet too critical to miss. Institutions which can leverage the new technologies gain superior market insights, create new business models, and will become the future leaders of the financial service industry. Individuals who can understand and work with FinTech open new gates for investment and career development. This course introduces FinTech and examines opportunities and challenges. It seeks to equip students with both a deep and practical understanding of emerging technology in the FinTech arena as well as the necessary coding skills to tackle future demand. We are going to cover topics such as the fundamentals of the financial service system, technology disruption, data management and visualization, financial data mining (Python), quantitative trading and artificial intelligence, crowdfunding, blockchain technology, and RegTech.Applications on practical FinTech problems are emphasized with case discussions and programming assignments. While we will work with computer codes, this course does NOT assume any programming background from students.",

The course is divided into two parts. Broadly, the first two-thirds of the course focuses more on analytic and strategic frameworks for managing innovation. This segment examines patterns of technological change and their impacts, planning for technological transitions, means for capturing economic benefits from innovation, and planning of innovation projects over time. The last third of the course examines more organizational issues involved in implementing strategies. These issues include management of teams and partnerships, learning within and across projects, the manager's role in forecasting and funding, directing and stopping innovation projects, technological entrepreneurship, and barriers to innovation. Case studies, both written and video-based, are used extensively to illustrate a range of technologies and the problems associated with developing them and bringing them to market.",
