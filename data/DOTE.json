Modern information technology is now available to facilitate knowledge creation out of existing data sources, codify and store knowledge for subsequent sharing and applications that create value. This course studies the basic methods, models and techniques of data and knowledge management. Specifically, it will achieve the following goals:\n\n1. Discuss database design, processing, and management in the context of relational systems. Topics such as normalization, integrity controls, and query languages (SQL) are emphasized.\n2. Develop competence in data modeling. Entity-Relationship models and other semantic data modeling methods are studied and their use for database design is illustrated.\n3. Gain hands-on experiences with database systems development using CASE tool and RDBMS.\n4. Cover knowledge acquisition, representation and applying knowledge through expert system.\n5. Introduce business intelligent that involves discovery knowledge from disparate data sources. Data warehouse, OLAP, data mining and big data are studied.",

      "description": "The course begins by constructing a simplified model of the macro economy. This is intended to help organize your discussion of issues confronting an economy. Every opportunity is taken to reinforce the economic concepts with current data, particularly for the U.S. and China. We then proceed to examine the policy instruments used to steer an economy towards the objectives of sustainable growth, stable inflation and low unemployment. Broadly speaking, these policy tools are monetary policy, implemented by a country's central bank, and fiscal policy implemented by the government when it makes expenditure and taxation decisions. We extend our exposition of traditional monetary policy to explain the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing, as well as the essential factors contributing to the financial crisis which necessitated this unconventional monetary policy. We then move onto the interactions between economies as captured in their respective balance of payment accounts and exchange rate movements. Fluctuations in China's RMB will be closely analyzed at this point and open the door for an in-depth look into China's domestic imbalances. We also examine Hong Kong's unique currency board system under-pinning our linked exchange rate.",

Although the course is quantitative in nature, we will try to avoid dealing with complicated mathematical theories whenever possible and, instead, stress on the intuition and logic behind the mathematical models and their managerial implications. Except for some illustrative examples in which problems may be solved manually, we will make heavy use of the popular Microsoft Excel and some of its add-in programs (e.g., Solver and StatTools) to solve most of the problems. It is our hope that, by the end of the term, you will feel comfortable about using Excel to analyse data and solve many of your business problems. More importantly, after completing this course, we hope you will develop a habit of thinking your problems in logical ways.",

The first part will cover fundamental econometrics topics such as ordinary least squares, instrumental variable estimation, panel data models, and generalized linear model. The second part will cover topics about business causal inference by either randomized field/lab experiments or natural experiments such as matching, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity design. This course is a graduate econometrics course that emphasizes application in pratice. Knowledge of multivariate calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and econometrics at the undergraduate level is preferred.",

It shows students how to apply such techniques in the context of finance. For example, discussion of a number of distributions pays special attention to heavy tail, skewness and other distribution features with regard to financial return analysis. Time-series analyses aim to explain the important influence of time-dependence in making economical predictions. Regression models cover CAPM as well as multifactor models to connote the cross-section relations among financial returns. GARCH and other volatility models introduce the related applications in risk management context. The course involves extensive use of real data examples and hands-on examples.",

For each system we study its objective, structure, and actual performance. We will focus on the theoretical aspects of these systems, but will also examine empirical findings on how well they function.\n\nThe second half of course surveys modern methods of applied micro-econometric research. We will begin by reviewing the Rubin Causal Model, its relationship with structural models, and the econometric definition of identification. We will then proceed to consider a number of econometric estimators, research designs, and inferential methods.",

Since most applied economic research examines questions with direct policy implications, this course will focus on methods for estimating causal effects.

      "course_syllabus": "Markets, organizations, and individuals use a wide variety of structures to co-ordinate resource production and allocation. Dramatic changes in information technology (IT) and business activities are forcing firms to come up with new ways of organizing work. Similarly, new types of digital information goods, much lower search costs, innovative ways of doing marketing, management, finance and human resource all lead to the disruption of old business models and creation of new ones.\nThis course uses economic theory to investigate the roles of information and technology in the existing diversity of organizations and markets and in enabling the creating of new organizational forms. The class is designed for PhD students in management, economics, information technology, marketing, operations management, organizational behavior and related disciplines. For economists, this class offers the opportunity to apply economic tools to understand how information technology and information in general affect organizations and markets. For non-economists, this class offers an exposure to fundamental ideas in the economics of information, organizations, and markets. This course covers quantitative research methodologies in Economics of IS. It consists of three components: Methodology, Economics of IS Research Topics, and Writing and Publishing. The main goal is to prepare PhD students to produce publication quality research using tools from information economics.\nWe will cultivate a culture of collaborative learning. In particular, in this seminar class, students come prepared to engage in thoughtful discussions of the materials. Students are asked to write informal, short memos prior to several of the classes. These memos will generally be responses to some questions or issues we pose prior to each class. In addition, each student will be asked to present at least one of the research papers as part of the class discussion.",

This segment examines patterns of technological change and their impacts, planning for technological transitions, means for capturing economic benefits from innovation, and planning of innovation projects over time. The last third of the course examines more organizational issues involved in implementing strategies. These issues include management of teams and partnerships, learning within and across projects, the manager's role in forecasting and funding, directing and stopping innovation projects, technological entrepreneurship, and barriers to innovation.
