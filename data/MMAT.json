Theoretical/statistical/mathematical/computational models and their applications with respect to social and network data from development and labor economics are studied. Essential topics/case-studies are selected from, but not limited to, network formation, peer effects and the social multiplier, social capital and trust, information aggregation in networks, social learning, trading in networks, technology diffusion, job search, and other related topics.",

Students will become familiar with essential mathematical techniques for imaging tasks, such as image processing in the spatial domain (using gradient, Laplacian, convolution) and frequency domain (using Fourier / wavelet transform). Variational models and PDE-based techniques will be discussed. Deep-learning based techniques will also be explored. Students are expected to have basic knowledge in calculus, linear algebra and MATLAB language. Some background in numerical analysis, Fourier analysis and partial differential equations will be helpful, although the necessary concepts will be discussed as they are used.",
