Through the food processing practicum, the principles, techniques and applications of conventional food processing technologies and equipment are introduced. Topics include frying, packaging, dehydration, concentration, sterilization, fermentation, protein coagulation, emulsification, baking, dough formation and candy making. This course also covers the techniques in formal sensory evaluation, and the principles of the common instruments for physical and chemical analyses of food quality. Besides, it contains an interactive workshop to explore the procedures in food product development in the contemporary catering and food industries.",

      "description": "Community nutrition recognizes that the control and prevention of nutrition problems are not merely biomedical in nature, but are embedded in the community of the affected individuals. A community nutritionist assesses and monitors not only physiological and dietary, but also social, cultural, technological and psychological information from many sources to determine needs and identify opportunities for sound, appropriate interventions that improve nutritional health. Because well-conceived nutrition surveys are basic tools for prioritising problems and deciding program plans and evaluations to provide better nutrition services to the public, the course will first introduce community nutrition survey design to the students. Making healthier choices, however, requires lifelong change in thinking and action at both individual and community levels. The rest of the course examines applications of current individual and group nutritional behaviour change theories to promote healthier diets.",

      "description": "Food can be contaminated at any stage of its production and handling with naturally occurring toxicants and/or man-made chemicals that have adverse health effects to humans. The objective of this course is to gain knowledge on the key concepts and principles of food safety and toxicology. Students are expected to develop an understanding of the nature and properties of the toxic substances in foods as well as the nature and magnitude of the hazard they represent to humans, with the aim of preventing health risks due to food intake. Topics on food safety include food hygiene, food poisoning, food legislation and food safety control systems. Topics on food toxicology include its general principles, biochemical and physiological mechanisms of action of food toxicants, and methods for food safety assessment. Emphasis will be placed on the evaluation of current issues in food safety toxicology including risk assessment and management.",
