This module acts as a bridge linking the fundamental theories and various clinical subjects in Chinese medicine, and thus remains as one of the key components within the framework of Chinese medicine’s specialties. Through the studies of this course, the students will be able to master the basic theories, fundamental knowledge and skills concerning the four diagnostic methods in Chinese medicine including observation, olfaction and auscultation, inquiring and palpation. Upon the completion of the course, the students will be capable of making clinical diagnosis using common pattern differentiation methods encompassing eight rubrics, etiology & qi, blood and body fluids, visceral differentiations. In addition, the students will be familiar with six channels differentiation, wei-qi-ying-xue differentiation, sanjiao differentiation and meridian differentiation methods. Emphasis will be placed on the training students’ practical skills in four diagnostic methods, differentiating clinical patterns and writing clinical case notes, so that the course will lay a solid foundation for future studies of clinical subjects. The module Basic Concepts in Chinese Medicine is a pre-requisite for this course.",

      "description": "As one of the most important classics in Chinese Medicine, Treatise on Exogenous Febrile Diseases (Shang Han Lun) focuses on the treatment of cold-attack disease and forms a recognition system with theory, therapy, formula and herbs, which is termed as theoretical system of treatment based on syndrome differentiation. Such thinking way and treatment system have played a great impact on the development of Chinese medicine in clinical treatment for thousands of years. By means of studying the original texts, students should learn to understand the method of syndrome differentiation, especially for the cold-attack disease and further to understand its important significance in clinical treatment, which will enable them to establish a solid foundation for the study of various clinical courses.",

Through the studies of this course, the students will be able to master the basic theories, fundamental knowledge and skills concerning the four diagnostic methods in Chinese medicine including observation, olfaction and auscultation, inquiring and palpation. Upon the completion of the course, the students will be capable of making clinical diagnosis using common pattern differentiation methods encompassing eight rubrics, etiology & qi, blood and body fluids, visceral differentiations. In addition, the students will be familiar with six channels differentiation, wei-qi-ying-xue differentiation, sanjiao differentiation and meridian differentiation methods. Emphasis will be placed on the training students’ practical skills in four diagnostic methods, differentiating clinical patterns and writing clinical case notes, so that the course will lay a solid foundation for future studies of clinical subjects. The module Basic Concepts in Chinese Medicine is a prerequisite for this course.",

Such thinking way and treatment system have played a great impact on the development of Chinese medicine in clinical treatment for thousands of years. By means of studying the original texts, students should learn to understand the method of syndrome differentiation, especially for the cold-attack disease and further to understand its important significance in clinical treatment, which will enable them to establish a solid foundation for the study of various clinical courses.",

It deals with research methodologies in two major streams: ancient classics and modern literature. Students are encouraged to critical appraise different types of scientific evidences in CM studies and apply their training to analyze clinical problems, to make clinical decisions, to identify prevention and treatment of diseases, and to further develop their own CM research. It covers literature search, literature review on CM classics, data management & statistics analysis, systematic review & meta-analysis. Moreover, this module prepares students to gain an analytical mind and critical thinking, and to train up their skills in thesis writing. Students need to draft a research protocol at the end of the course and perform an oral presentation. They will continue their studies in the next semester and submit a final thesis after attending BCME 6123 “Research methodologies and essay writing (II) ”. These two courses are geared towards equipping graduates to continue with doctoral studies or research development in tertiary institutions or Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Hospital in the future.",

Students need to draft a research protocol at the end of course. They will continue their studies in the next semester and submit a research paper or review paper after attending BCME6330 “Research Methodologies and Thesis Writing in Chinese Medicine and Placement (II)”.Students are also required to attend a placement scheme. During the period of the scheme, students will engage in on-site visits and be placed in research laboratories / Institute for Food and Drug Control / Chinese medicine herbal companies / proprietary Chinese medicine companies to perform duties under the guidance of field supervisors. The placement scheme will help students to broaden their views in the industry and deepen their understanding in the application of advanced technologies to research and development of CM drugs.",
