Students will learn how to observe, collect, analyze and evaluate evidence found at crime scenes. The first part addresses the identification of biological fluids such as blood, semen, and saliva from crime scene. The emphasis will be on the biochemical technologies used in the presumptive and confirmatory tests. The second part covers DNA analysis using RFLP and PCR-STR typing methods, interpretation of DNA typing results, and court presentation of such biological evidence. Mitochondrial DNA typing and Y chromosome DNA typing will also be discussed. It is anticipated that students will apply the biochemistry knowledge they have acquired in junior years in the course. In addition to the core academic knowledge, various in-class activities will also be integrated for students to appreciate the importance and to apply the knowledge they have learnt in class. Teaching takes place in the evening. Part of the class will be taught with MSc students under different course code and assessment scheme.",
