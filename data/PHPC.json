The objective of the course is to provide a broad intellectual perspective of public health and presents both local and global public health challenges that are facing our society in the 21st century. The various academic disciplines within the domains of public health that include environmental health sciences, health policy and management, social and behavioral sciences and basic science will be introduced and discussed. The impact of these public health problems in relation to our society and our everyday lives will be emphasized. An analytic public health problem solving framework will be used to enable students to appreciate and learn the problem solving methodology in evaluating and appraising various public health problems.",

With the study tour, students can gain first-hand experiences and grasp certain knowledge about the health system, its structure, governance, financing and service delivery provision in specific jurisdiction which may varies in each year depending on the site arrangement of corresponding study tour. Students will identify the strengths of the system, how it produces good outcome and what challenges it tackles in order to achieve the good health and high quality of healthcare in population. The study tour also ties policy with health system in a broader context.\n\nStudents are required to select a study topic of interest, for example, healthcare financing and universal coverage, long term care, quality of healthcare delivery, and impact of policy in population health and then to review literature, to collect information from the places visited and seminar, and to deliver a presentation in the class.\n\nThis course will be held during term breaks under the supervision of one or more faculty members. Students are responsible for all travel expenses in the study tour, including air fares, accommodation, food, transportation and travel insurance.\n\nThe objectives of the course are three-fold:\n(1) to offer students a field-based education in their undergraduate programs for the extension of classroom learning through direct observation, sharing and experience;(2) to deepen students’ understanding on health system in a broader context including its structure, governance, financing and service delivery provision; and\n(3) to provide students a comprehensive view on local and regional public health issues in health system.",

      "description": "This field study course is supplementary to the three classroom-based courses CHPR2001, PHPC2009 and PHPC3016 on the environmental factors in public health. Students can gain first-hand experiences and grasp certain practical skills by conducting the field studies in Hong Kong, China and other areas. Environmental health is about how the environmental factors may adversely impact the public health and what we can do to prevent or minimize these impacts. By the scale, the hazards can be local (e.g., industrial and household pollution, traffic exhaust), regional (e.g., deteriorating regional air quality), or global (e.g., climate change); by the relationship to social development, the hazards can be traditional (e.g., household hygiene) or modern (e.g., new chemicals). Without field studies, the students may have difficulties in understand the broad scopes of environmental health practice. This course is to fill in this gap by conducting local and regional field studies and equipping the students with practical skills (e.g., air sampling techniques) in environmental monitoring, risk assessment and management. Students are first required to select a study topic of interest, for example air pollution and respiratory diseases, water pollution and metal industry, and social development and sustainability, and then to review literature, to collect information from the places visited, and to write up a final report.\n\nThis course will be held during term breaks under the supervision of one or more faculty members. Students are responsible for all travel expenses in the field study, including transportation, food, accommodation, and travel insurance.\n\nThe objectives of the course are three-fold: (1) to offer students a field-based education early in their undergraduate programs for the extension of classroom learning through direct observation and experience; (2) to deepen students’ understanding on relationships between environment and health, with emphasis on pollution, social development, and sustainability; and (3) to provide students a comprehensive view on local and regional public health issues.",

This course is designed for public health and biomedical students to understand the concepts and practices of data science, as well as to develop skills in querying epidemiological data to make informed decisions for health and biomedical studies. It will discuss various aspects of data processing, analysis, and visualization techniques in the R computing environment and the use of modern coding approach to streamline the progress from mining data to presenting findings. Students will be introduced to modern data-driven techniques to identify important non-genetic factors. The course will also cover advanced topics, including omics and precision medicine, artificial intelligence (AI)/ machine learning (ML) in biomedical decision-making, and investigations with real-world data.

We will explore questions such as: What are the social meanings of illness? What is social production of health and illness? How do social ties and social capital affect health? How does the social environment interact with genes to influence health? What is medicalization and what are possible consequences of medicalization? How should health care systems be organized? In this course, we will examine some of these issues in the contexts of Chinese societies, such as mainland China and Hong Kong, and also offer comparative perspectives.",
