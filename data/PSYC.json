      "required_readings": "Course handout. Due to the extraordinarily wide scope and interdisciplinary nature of this course, there is no single specific reading we think is essential for every student. Instead we give a long list of suggested readings for each major topic covered (see in attachment). Students can choose a topic to write deeply about in their final paper. MORE IMPORTANTLY, we have set up 8 web discussions for which students have to provide their ideas for various topics (see below). To provide informative and insightful ideas and thus get good marks for these questions, students will not only have to understand the lectures, but also do extra readings. Therefore although only the course handout is put here as the required reading, students actually are expected to read a lot more than that to fulfil the requirement. It is just that we do not stipulate the exact readings they have to do.\n\n###### ## WEB DISCUSSION TOPICS ##########\n\n* *Web Discussion 1**\n\n* *Topic 1 - Find a scientific paper whcih suggests that sleep is essential (or unimportant) in humans.**\n\nWithin 100 words, try your best to convince your fellow students that the study provides strong support for the importance (or the lack of importance) of sleep in humans. Attach the title, journal name, issue number, page number, and abstract of the study at the end of your post (these would not count towards the word limit). Articles in the newspaper, popular magazines, or websites will not be accepted.\n\n* *Topic 2 - Within 150 words, make 3 suggestions (with explanations) to the following patient (a 60-year-old retired woman) with insomnia.**\n\nPatient: “I have problem going to sleep. If I can fall asleep at 3am, that would be really early. Sometimes I can’t sleep until 5 or 6. Usually I spend 1-2 hours in bed before falling asleep, even if I wait until 3pm to get in bed. That’s very frustrating. The more I urge myself to fall asleep the harder it becomes. I tried going to bed earlier for a few days, but it didn’t help. I still couldn’t sleep until 3 or 4. So I tend to get up late, around 11-12. Still, after dinner, I often feel extremely sleepy and can’t help having a nap. I can nap almost immediately whenever I get on a bus during the day too. I have a coffee every day, usually after brunch, which is around 2-3. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I have to go to a Tai Chi class at 8 in the morning, and you can imagine how hard it is for me to get up. I’ve not tried any sleep pills, as I heard that they are addictive and would lose effect after some time. Ah – I usually go to shower at 11pm and then watch TV and read newspaper before going to bed. I tried to shower earlier for a few days but it didn’t help.”\n\n* *Topic 3 - In less than 150 words, interpret the following dream.**\n\nYou can make use of this (http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionary/) and other dream dictionaries to help you, but you are not limited to that.\n\n“There is my brother Dave. He is leisurely jogging up a green slope. He got all the way to the top and there my friend Nelson is hugging a woman. Their faces are softened by mild, rosy light of the setting sun. Gradually they dissolved into the dense, orange air… Suddenly everything disappears and I find myself in bed. I tried to go back to the slope I dream of but I can’t. So I get up and open the door. I see a long beach. The air is brisk and the sun hasn’t come out yet. The tide is full and water is rushing into my bedroom…”\n\n* *Web Discussion 2**\n\n* *Topic 1 - Mind-enhancing drugs should be encouraged for students in CUHK**\n\nIn less than 100 words, give one argument for and one argument against the above notion. The clarity and strength of your argument will be the most important.\n\n* *Topic 2 - The placebo effect - useful or dangerous?**\n\nIn less than 100 words, suggest one useful and one dangerous applications of the placebo effect.\n\n* *Web Discussion 3**\n\n* *Topic 1 – Hypnosis, Meditation, and Level of Consciousness**\n\nIs a meditating person at a higher or lower level of consciousness compared with a person being hypnotized? Discuss within 100 words.\n\n* *Topic 2 – Hypnosis or Meditation?**\n\nWhich, hypnosis or meditation, would you choose to help you study better, assuming that the university provides 24-hour hypnotists and meditation trainees for each student if necessary? Discuss your choice within 100 words.\n\n* *Web Discussion 4 (Allow attachment of files!! <2MB)**\n\n* *Topic 1 – Unconscious Perception Products**\n\nFind a product or service (online or on printed media) which claims to have an effect based on subliminal/unconscious perception. An example would be a self-confidence boosting CD containing subliminal messages of encouraging words played backwards. In less than 100 words, mention the product’s name, its claimed function, and your commentary on whether the claim stands or not. Include the link of the website or a scanned image (<2MB) of the printed advertisement / package of the product. Your answer will be marked based on the novelty of the product and the quality of your commentary.\n\n* *Topic 2 – Scientific Support for ESP**\n\nIn less than 100 words, summarize a scientific study which provides support for an ESP phenomenon, and discuss whether the evidence given is strong or weak. Include the paper topic, journal name, issue number, page number, and abstract of the study at the end of your post (these would not count towards the word limit). Articles in the newspaper, popular magazines, or websites will not be accepted.\n\n* *Topic 3 – Unconscious Marketing**\n\nFind an advertisement on the newspaper, magazine, TV, etc., that uses unconscious perception to promote a product. In less than 100 words discuss the way this is done, and evaluate on the effectiveness. Include the link of the website or a scanned image (<2MB) of the printed advertisement / package of the product. Your answer will be marked based on the novelty of the marketing technique and the quality of your commentary.\n\n* *Web Discussion 5 (Allow attachement of files! <5MB)**\n\n* *Topic 1 – Mind Tricks in Art**\n\nGive an example of how the phenomena we discussed on Lectures 8 and 9 (Attention; Creations of the Mind) are applied to one of the following art forms or media (drawing, photography, movie, music, advertisement on print, or commercials). In less than 100 words, explain what trick(s) is/are used and how, and comment on the effectiveness. Include the link to or the file of the art work (<5MB). Your answer will be marked based on the novelty of the example (as compared with your peers), the clarity of your explanation of the tricks, and the analytic quality of your comment.\n\n* *Web Discussion 6**\n\n* *Topic 1 – Criterion for Consciousness**\n\nWithin 100 words, list the most important criterion you think that an animal or machine has to fulfill in order to qualify as a conscious entity, and explain your answer. There is no model answer to this question, and depending on the purpose in answering this question the same person may come up with different criteria. Therefore it is good enough to clearly state your criterion and explain why it is chosen among other possible criteria.\n\n* *Web Discussion 7**\n\n* *Topic 1 – Libet’s Experiment and Free Will**\n\nIf, based on the results of Libet’s ERP experiment discussed in class, someone concludes that humans have no free will, would you agree? If not, what is your position? Within 100 words, state your position and provide a strong reason to justify your position. Whether the reason is clear and convincing is the key. It is fine whether you think of the reason yourself or use a reason from the literature, but in the latter case you have to provide the reference.\n\n* *Topic 2 – How Much “Human” Is Human Enough?**\n\nSuppose you undergo a surgery such that 30% of your brain cells are replaced by computer chips. Do you think you are still as “humanly conscious” as you are before? Discuss within 100 words.\n\n* *Web Discussion 8**\n\n* *Topic 1 – What Have You Got and What Should Be Added?**\n\nIn less than 100 words, (a) describe one idea/topic/question you got from this course that is the most valuable; and (b) describe one idea/topic/question you have that has not been covered in this course. If you do not have an answer for (a) you can describe two ideas for (b). The goal of this exercise is for you to reflect on what you learned from this course. Full marks will be granted (by default) for this discussion unless your description is not clear or the idea/topic/question you describe as not covered has actually been covered in class.",

      "description": "This is an introductory course on social dilemmas. Social dilemma is a mixed-motive situation in which a person’s selfish interest to maximize his or her own gain may undermine the collective interest of everyone. The basic research question is “why do people cooperate?” Social dilemma is a theoretical model describing the general conflict between cooperation and competition in all sorts of real-life situations, e.g., conserving energy, donating blood, contributing to charities, or using public transportation. The course introduces different types of social dilemmas like prisoner’s dilemma, public goods, and resource dilemmas. Emphasizing a social psychological perspective, we will also cover psychological factors like leadership, trust, criticality, and social value orientation that have been found to affect cooperation in social dilemmas. Theories and concepts will be illustrated through various social dilemma games in tutorials.",

Students will learn about successful stories of psychology applications, and under the guidance of the teaching team, design and implement their own projects in an attempt to apply theories and findings of psychology to make an impact on people's lives and the society-at-large.\nA problem-based learning approach will be implemented in this course. Under the framework of design thinking, students will identify the issue of interest and apply their psychological knowledge to create changes on the issues. Students will be engaged in a wide range of in-class discussions, problem-based activities, and self-reflection processes to facilitate their learning. Students are expected to go outside the classroom, connect with the potential stakeholders and discuss their proposal with them. By the end of the course, students are required to give a group presentation and submit a project proposal to consolidate their thinking and efforts and to reflect on the possibility of future actions.\n\nAdvisory: For Psychology Majors only.",

Each student should decide with the field supervisor as soon as possible a fixed weekly schedule for his/her work at the placement. A copy of the finalized schedule should be submitted to the professor for record. Throughout the semester, each student will receive supervision and advice from the field supervisor as well as the professor and the tutor.\n3. Group discussions: There will be approximately biweekly group discussion sessions, each taking around 2.5 hours. Additional sessions may be held throughout the semester for guest speeches or near the end of the semester for oral presentations if needed.\nStudents are expected to openly share their experience working at different placements (e.g., any observations they make, any practical work they engage in, any difficulties or problems they encounter).

This practicum experience represents the culmination of knowledge and competencies that the students have developed towards assessment of common mental health difficulties and interventions using low-intensity interventions and guided self-help within the stepped care model. Students at the practicum settings will work as part of the team in providing evidence-based services to individuals with mild to moderate common mental health difficulties. Issues pertinent to service delivery such as risk management, medication, and multi-cultural competence are discussed to raise the awareness, sensitivity, and competence of students in providing services. The science and practice of adaptations during the service implementation to accommodate individuals from diverse social, cultural, health, economic, and occupational backgrounds as well as in-service settings with varied resources and community contexts will be introduced to enhance students’ critical appreciation of the knowledge, attitudes, and competencies required to support clients’ recovery in an inclusive, value-driven way. Students need to fulfill at least 160 hours on-site under the supervision of clinical psychologists and attend biweekly one-hour clinical skills supervision by the course instructor.",

Practicum: Students are expected to work for at least 160 hours at their placement. Ideally, students should be at their placement for 2 full days or 4 half-days per week. In the case where there are two or more students assigned to the same setting, they should try to work on alternate days of the week. Students are advised to work out a detailed schedule with the supervisor at their placement as soon as possible. A copy of the schedule should be given to the instructor for record.\n3. Discussion group: Attendance is mandatory. The purpose of these sessions, to be scheduled according to instructor and students’ schedule is to provide students with an opportunity to develop their clinical skills and to share their working experience with each other.",

Throughout the evolutionary history, our ancestors developed a repertoire of cognitive skills that are fundamental to human civilization. In some cases, we are different from other animals quantitatively (e.g., capacity of memory). In other cases, the ability concerned may be unique to us (e.g., communication with language). It is indeed difficult to imagine a life without these cognitive abilities. In lectures, students will be introduced with the basic concepts and findings about various cognitive abilities including cognition, sensation, perception, memory system, decision-making, and language-processing. In tutorials, they will receive trainings in conducting research in cognitive psychology.",

      "description": "Dramatic advances have occurred in the past two decades in the study of psychopathology. Human genome has been fully sequenced, the technologies of neuroimaging have made it possible for researchers to observe a brain in action in living people, and psychology has entered the Decade of the Mind. In this new decade, psychology has been re-defined as a science examining how human mind works in general. Abnormal psychology, on the other hand, specializes in understanding how human mind works when it goes haywire. This course is designed to provide you with the most updated knowledge in the field of psychopathology. You will learn about the key concepts of mental disorders, how mental predispositions and upbringing experience interact in the development of various mental disorders, how human mind works in different mental disorders, and more importantly, how you can continue to learn about the science of psychopathology on your own after you have completed the course. After all, learning is about “learning how to learn.”",

      "description": "This course provides a fundamental background in health and community psychology. Students will have the opportunity to critically examine and evaluate conceptual, methodological, and research issues that are germane in health and community psychology. New developments in these areas will be covered to equip students to lead the field. Focus will be on the synthesis and integration of the two disciplines within a person-in-environment perspective. Students are expected to evaluate issues not only at the individual level, but as well as within the ecology, including groups, settings, communities, cultures, etc. Furthermore, prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation are equally emphasized. It is the aim that students will have a fundamental understanding of major health and community psychology concepts and be able to conceptualize various health issues and formulate sound interventions in an ecological perspective.",

      "description": "The course will serve as the first introduction to behavioural and cognitive therapies and emphasize both theoretical and practical training. It aims at training students basic competence to begin practising behavioural and cognitive therapies for adult psychological/psychiatric disorders. In the first part of the course, the general procedure of behavioural and cognitive therapies will be discussed, while in the second part, the application of behavioural and cognitive therapies to specific disorders, e.g., depression, anxiety disorders, substance-related disorders, personality disorders, and psychotic disorders, etc., will be elaborated. A substantial proportion of time during class will be allocated to discussing simulated therapy sessions on videotapes. The students are expected to do their own readings before coming to class. They will be required to make presentations on the application of behavioural and cognitive therapies to specific disorders, as well as on intervention studies regarding their efficacy and effectiveness.",

      "description": "The course will emphasize both theoretical and practical training on work with children and adolescents. It first starts with a discussion on developmental psychopathology. Then, the major focus of the course would aim at training students basic competence to perform intake diagnostic interview, assessment, diagnostic formulation, case conceptualization, and treatment planning, as well as to practise psychological intervention in treating various childhood and adolescent psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders, etc., as illustration of the treatment processes. The course ends at discussing how to match and fine-tune common treatment processes to particular aspects of different disorders. A substantial proportion of the time during class will be allocated to discussing simulated therapy sessions and role-play on videotapes. The students are expected to do their own readings before coming to class.",

      "description": "The course consists of two parts. The first part focuses on the clinical management of clients with a history of psychological trauma. The management of a client with trauma history is challenging. This difficulty comes from various aspects, including unstable therapeutic relationships, acute crises, and the intrusions of trauma memories. A series of topics are designed to cover these issues. The second part of the course is devoted to a process-oriented view of psychotherapy. Process-oriented treatment targets the general patterns and common factors of psychotherapy, especially the interpersonal transaction between a client and a therapist. Studying the process of psychotherapy is expected to increase the flexibility in clinical practice.",

      "description": "This course systematically addresses the theory and practice of clinical supervision for professional psychologists, encompassing the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and ethical aspects. Students will examine up-to-date research evidence of clinical supervision as a core competency for professional psychologists, including theories and models that pertain to general frameworks as well as those specific for treatment modalities. Discussions and critical analyses will facilitate in-depth conceptualisation on issues such as ethical practice, reflective practice, diversity and inclusivity, giving and receiving feedback, and supervisory bond. Role-plays and skill practices will enable students to come up with realistic plans about how to set up clinical supervision and design supervisory activities strategically, provide evaluation constructively, and handle difficult situations effectively. As future leaders of the field, students will be encouraged to see beyond the dyad of an individual supervisor and the supervisee, but to gain insights into how to integrate good practices of clinical supervision into professional psychologists’ day-to-day services, promote sustainable professional development and improvement of clinical care, and cultivate a growth mindset in their work culture.",
