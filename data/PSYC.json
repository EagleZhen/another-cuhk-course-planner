      "description": "The course deals with both conceptual and practical issues in interpersonal communication. Both verbal and non-verbal communication modes will be discussed in two major domains: interpersonal relationships, including friendships, romantic relationships, and family communication patterns; as well as in the workplace, focusing on effective negotiation, management, and presentation skills. In each of these domains, students will be exposed to research on how communication modes vary as a function of factors such as gender, culture, and social status, as well as learning how to examine their own and others' communication styles.",

In addition, we will discuss how to design are search project that involves qualitative methods, as well as several methods for collecting, analysing, interpreting, and writing up reports based on qualitative data. Students will be given hands-on exercises in collecting interview and observational data and will be expected to transcribe audio and/or video-recordings that they make and take field notes of their experiences.",

The course introduces different types of social dilemmas like prisoner’s dilemma, public goods, and resource dilemmas. Emphasizing a social psychological perspective, we will also cover psychological factors like leadership, trust, criticality, and social value orientation that have been found to affect cooperation in social dilemmas. Theories and concepts will be illustrated through various social dilemma games in tutorials.",

This practicum experience represents the culmination of knowledge and competencies that the students have developed towards assessment of common mental health difficulties and interventions using low-intensity interventions and guided self-help within the stepped care model. Students at the practicum settings will work as part of the team in providing evidence-based services to individuals with mild to moderate common mental health difficulties. Issues pertinent to service delivery such as risk management, medication, and multi-cultural competence are discussed to raise the awareness, sensitivity, and competence of students in providing services. The science and practice of adaptations during the service implementation to accommodate individuals from diverse social, cultural, health, economic, and occupational backgrounds as well as in-service settings with varied resources and community contexts will be introduced to enhance students’ critical appreciation of the knowledge, attitudes, and competencies required to support clients’ recovery in an inclusive, value-driven way. Students need to fulfill at least 160 hours on-site under the supervision of clinical psychologists and attend biweekly one-hour clinical skills supervision by the course instructor.",

Throughout the evolutionary history, our ancestors developed a repertoire of cognitive skills that are fundamental to human civilization. In some cases, we are different from other animals quantitatively (e.g., capacity of memory). In other cases, the ability concerned may be unique to us (e.g., communication with language). It is indeed difficult to imagine a life without these cognitive abilities. In lectures, students will be introduced with the basic concepts and findings about various cognitive abilities including cognition, sensation, perception, memory system, decision-making, and language-processing. In tutorials, they will receive trainings in conducting research in cognitive psychology.",

      "description": "Dramatic advances have occurred in the past two decades in the study of psychopathology. Human genome has been fully sequenced, the technologies of neuroimaging have made it possible for researchers to observe a brain in action in living people, and psychology has entered the Decade of the Mind. In this new decade, psychology has been re-defined as a science examining how human mind works in general. Abnormal psychology, on the other hand, specializes in understanding how human mind works when it goes haywire. This course is designed to provide you with the most updated knowledge in the field of psychopathology. You will learn about the key concepts of mental disorders, how mental predispositions and upbringing experience interact in the development of various mental disorders, how human mind works in different mental disorders, and more importantly, how you can continue to learn about the science of psychopathology on your own after you have completed the course. After all, learning is about “learning how to learn.”",

In particular, students will learn how to apply appropriate statistical methods in various research scenarios and how to interpret the results. Even though mathematical proofs and statistical derivations will be reduced to a minimum, having the knowledge of basic mathematics and matrix manipulations will be helpful. Various statistical software programs (such as EQS, HLM) in addition to SPSS will be introduced and the ability to use these programmes for data analysis is important.",

Students will have the opportunity to critically examine and evaluate conceptual, methodological, and research issues that are germane in health and community psychology. New developments in these areas will be covered to equip students to lead the field. Focus will be on the synthesis and integration of the two disciplines within a person-in-environment perspective. Students are expected to evaluate issues not only at the individual level, but as well as within the ecology, including groups, settings, communities, cultures, etc. Furthermore, prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation are equally emphasized. It is the aim that students will have a fundamental understanding of major health and community psychology concepts and be able to conceptualize various health issues and formulate sound interventions in an ecological perspective.",

It aims at training students basic competence to begin practising behavioural and cognitive therapies for adult psychological/psychiatric disorders. In the first part of the course, the general procedure of behavioural and cognitive therapies will be discussed, while in the second part, the application of behavioural and cognitive therapies to specific disorders, e.g., depression, anxiety disorders, substance-related disorders, personality disorders, and psychotic disorders, etc., will be elaborated. A substantial proportion of time during class will be allocated to discussing simulated therapy sessions on videotapes. The students are expected to do their own readings before coming to class. They will be required to make presentations on the application of behavioural and cognitive therapies to specific disorders, as well as on intervention studies regarding their efficacy and effectiveness.",

The management of a client with trauma history is challenging. This difficulty comes from various aspects, including unstable therapeutic relationships, acute crises, and the intrusions of trauma memories. A series of topics are designed to cover these issues. The second part of the course is devoted to a process-oriented view of psychotherapy. Process-oriented treatment targets the general patterns and common factors of psychotherapy, especially the interpersonal transaction between a client and a therapist. Studying the process of psychotherapy is expected to increase the flexibility in clinical practice.",

Students will examine up-to-date research evidence of clinical supervision as a core competency for professional psychologists, including theories and models that pertain to general frameworks as well as those specific for treatment modalities. Discussions and critical analyses will facilitate in-depth conceptualisation on issues such as ethical practice, reflective practice, diversity and inclusivity, giving and receiving feedback, and supervisory bond. Role-plays and skill practices will enable students to come up with realistic plans about how to set up clinical supervision and design supervisory activities strategically, provide evaluation constructively, and handle difficult situations effectively. As future leaders of the field, students will be encouraged to see beyond the dyad of an individual supervisor and the supervisee, but to gain insights into how to integrate good practices of clinical supervision into professional psychologists’ day-to-day services, promote sustainable professional development and improvement of clinical care, and cultivate a growth mindset in their work culture.",
