      "description": "Aligning the founding aspiration of the College, “Learning, innovation, and benefitting humankind”, this course provides students with opportunities to apply their academic skills and knowledge to care for and serve the people in the society. It also enhances the understanding of students of community issues, as well as the capacities and assets of the community, with an aim to promote students’ apprehension of social inclusion. Students will engage in experiential learning to critically study and apply concepts and theories in an authentic, real-world environment through social servicing. To prepare students to care for others, they will first learn to care for themselves through developing loving-kindness, empathy, mindfulness, and respect for diversity. Students will review and reflect on the strengths and real-life needs of the community. Guided by course instructors, students will design and implement service-learning projects by themselves or in association with non-government organizations, social enterprises, or volunteer groups as host organizations. The course concludes with a post-service review in which students will share and reflect on their service-learning experience, re-examine their own self to gain deeper and broader appreciation of how their own discipline and academic knowledge relates to the society, and develop an enhanced sense of civic responsibility and a lifelong commitment.",

Such an understanding, however, would render it lifeless and irrelevant to the everyday life of the believers. In fact, the lived experiences of the believers also contribute to the particularities of Buddhist traditions established worldwide. This course aims at exploring the traditional and contemporary ways by which Buddhist teachings are expressed and experienced in the lives of the believers, in groups and individually. There are three major components to this course. First, we shall discuss the body-mind relation, and the nurturing of mental and physical health with topics such as dietary practices, meditation, mindfulness, counselling, and Buddhist psychology. We shall also contemplate on the cultural manifestations of Buddhism in literature, popular culture, language, photography, film, folk custom, etc. Finally, we shall consider the light that Buddhism may shed on topics of contemporary life such as love, death, transgender issues.No prior knowledge of Buddhism is necessary. SDG-SE #3 Good Health and Well-being:This course aims at relating students’ personal growth and everyday life to Buddhist teachings so as to help them cultivate a constructive outlook on self-identity, and understand the Buddhist ways in promoting healthy lives and well-being.",

Through project-based learning, students will try to form a team to co-work together to define a start-up project that they want to do in this course. With this ownership of the project, they will also learn how to collaborate, communicate, contribute to the project. With the tailormade lectures based on the roadmap of start-up, including the session about impact to society (introduction to United Nation’s 17 SDGs), students will learn different start-up skillsets step by step. In addition, each group of the start-up team will be assigned an industrial mentor to share experience and guidance to the team to upgrade the business plan to a realistic plan. Finally, students will have a presentation in the demo day to share their projects to potential investors. After this course, students are invited to join CUHK Entrepreneurs Day organized by CUHK Alumni Affairs Office. Thus, this course provides whole-person training to encourage students to be innovative and have entrepreneurship spirit.",

      "description": "City living is a modern way of life and sustainability has become the central issue of urban development. By 2020, it is expected that about 60% of the worlds’s population will live in cities. Cities are thus the places where touch most the quality of life. With the development of economy, society and technology, cities have undergone dramatic changes in their strength, structure and direction. Some cities continue to prosper while others experience declining. How individuals and urban communities can survive and even prosper demands a good understanding of the urban systems. This course will be devoted to the investigation of the growth dynamics of cities, their economic, social and environmental problems and the ways to develop sustainable cities. Many daily life examples of Hong Kong and other cities in China and western countries will be used to illustrate various urban contradictions and problems. After being equipped with the knowledge of various urban issues and problems, students are expected to contribute their knowledge to the urban communities by participating well planned service learning projects in this course and then further enhance their ability to learn effectively through service. After taking this course, students will be well-prepared for challenges in world cities such as Hong Kong and equipped with the knowledge and the vision to become a responsible and concerned urban resident with a passion of caring for people and communities.",

      "description": "This course explores how mass media - music, video, prints, television, Internet, etc. - affects cultures and societies. Based mainly on, but not limited to, anthropological perspective, this course will discuss how mass media is not just part of our culture and cultural products; but a very important part and an everyday context for the making of culture. This course will examine the processes of mass media production, circulation and consumption to address the following issues: 1) how mass media affect the representation and reproduction of different cultures and societies, 2) how mass media representations contribute to national and transnational identities, 3) how both governmental and market forces create and restrict possibilities of mass media representations, and 4) how technological development affects the relationships among mass media, culture and society. Through investigating the relationship between mass media, society and culture, this course aims at not only acquiring basic idea about anthropology and mass media studies but, more importantly, on reflective and critical thinking regarding who we are and cultural differences in the society we live. To encourage learning through experience - in the field -, not just classroom interactions, this course will include two fieldtrips. One of the trips will focus on the production of mass media. The class will visit and interview mass media producers - music studios, editors of popular magazines, website managers, etc. - at there work sites to learn about the concerns and conditions of mass media production. The other one will focus on the distribution and consumption of mass media. The class will visit a public space where vigorous commercial activities constantly taking place - for example, the Times Square Open Piazza, to observe and investigate what sorts of mass media are presented, how they, together with people, buildings, etc., made of the space, and also how various people passed by engage in different form of mass mediation.",

      "description": "Since the beginning of time, great leaders have used their power of oratory to win and inspire followers. These great people and their stories have made history. Their speeches capture the truth of life, the nature of mankind and uplifted the spirit, not just for their contemporaries, but also that of generations to come. This course aims to inspire candidates with thought-provoking speeches and brave stories from a wide range of historical eras and nations, so that they become leaders of tomorrow, with a soul and a heart. People (and their speeches) in modern history have been chosen, for their contributions to human right, to peace and love, and to wellness of mankind. Examples include: (1) Nelson Mandela’s “I am the first accused”, (2) John F Kennedy’s “Ask not what your country can do for you”, (3) Martin Luther King Jr’s “I have a dream”, (4) Mother Teresa’s “love begins at home”, (5) Winston Churchill’s “I have nothing to offer but…”, (6) Franklin Roosevelt’s “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself, and (7) Ronald Regan’s “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall”, …….

These issues are within the four general areas of language studies, namely, general linguistics, socio-historical linguistics, educational linguistics and interface inquiry. This course will provide participants with service-learning activities, such as analyzing the difficulty that new immigrants/ students from the Mainland have in distinguishing Cantonese tones, discussing with teachers how the use of trendy expressions in Hong Kong affects secondary students’ writing performance in Chinese, and documenting the changes in Cantonese by comparing Cantonese movies collected in Hong Kong Film Archive with present-day movies. It is hoped that the activities will allow students to combine theoretical and practical knowledge together and to further enhance their appreciation of the complexity of Cantonese grammar.",

      "credits": "3.00",
      "terms": [],
      "description": "Gender is a pivotal aspect of family relationships. The family is a domain where unequal gender relationships between men and women are systematically created and reproduced. As a social institution, the family, through its distribution of resources, division of labour, and perceptions about gender identity, reinforces a hierarchical relationship between men and women in which men are privileged. On the one hand, the family is an important interactive arena for examining how people produce and do gender, and how gender strategies are created in everyday life. On the other hand, gender is a tool for dissecting the structure of family, its processes, and the outcomes of interactions between its members. This course aims to investigate the complex links between gender and family from a global perspective. It highlights cultural and national similarities and differences in gender and family relationships, the diversities in state responses to the emerging challenges on gender and family relationships globally, and the rapid development of a globalized discourse of gender equality that is based on calls for universal human rights, on blurring the public and private divide and on challenging the boundaries between family and society.",

More generally, students should acquire a set of analytical skills and methods to critically reflect on the concept of gender in contributing to our understanding of societies and cultures; to understand the diversified family formation process, family patterns and practices, the role of evidence and research methods in cross cultural comparative analysis; the role of transferable skills and insights beyond national and cultural boundaries, and the development of global values of human rights and equality for reflecting on the social reality of own society and individual biography, as well as one’s value positions and life choices.",

In the first stage students will be taught to appreciate master pieces and to appraise critically the underlying political, philosophical and power themes of the play. During the process students also learn basic writing skills. Students are required to choose a topic that inspires them the most. Through field visits, they will observe how people communicate with each other under different social contexts. Students will note down the register variations in dialogues as reference materials for writing. In the second stage students will engage in intensive writing with close guidance of the instructor to ensure that their chosen theme can adequately be depicted through the play. In the third stage students will read and comment on each other’s work in order to polish the play. Throughout the three stages of appreciating masterpieces, researching and writing one’s play and commenting on each other’s work, students engage in an active and critical exploration of the impact of culture, politics and power on one’s own life.",

      "description": "This course adopts a service-learning approach to examine how environmental sustainability can be achieved in a fair, just, and equitable manner through impactful community service. By utilizing the environmental justice framework, students will explore how social inequalities shape the processes and outcomes of sustainable development. Environmental justice highlights the need to address the intersection of social justice and environmental issues. A relevant example is that the main contributors to and bearers of the consequences of climate change are not equally distributed across societies. Some societal groups are more vulnerable to climate risks or less capable of mitigating them. For instance, the rising energy costs to offset rising temperatures impact individuals living in poverty differently compared to those in better living conditions. The focus of student service will be on raising the awareness towards making an impact in one of the four dimensions of environmental justice: identifying distributional issues related to environmental impact, recognizing the environmental needs and voices of communities, fostering community participation in sustainability-promoting activities, and developing community capabilities for environmental resilience and sustainable growth. Course lectures will explore SDG #2 Zero Hunger, #7 Affordable and Clean Energy, #12 Responsible Consumption and Production, #13 Climate Action, #14 Life Below Water, #15 Life on Land, #17 Partnerships for the Goals, and students will be guided to initiate service-learning projects that attempt to address related social-environmental issues, for example designing a way to address energy poverty, tailor-made community responses to food waste and food security, collecting essential information regarding procurement policies and raising public awareness of their global impact, recycling, exploring potential impact of solid waste charging, the plastic-free movement, addition/extraction in country parks, environmental education, and other related topics approved by the course instructor.",

The topics will be related to the United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to foster students’ understanding of the significance of these SDGs in environmental protection. Students will present their service-learning experience toward the end of the course.\n\nThis service-learning course will be conducted with combined teaching and learning activities. In addition to the five standard lectures stated in Part A, students are required to attend regular project preparation lectures to prepare for their service learning projects. This includes three additional lectures (3 hours each x 3) for instructor-guided group service planning and discussions related to the service-learning project (Part C). The topics covered in the regular lectures will be further elaborated and expanded upon during these interactive discussions, aiming to assist students in formulating their service-learning plans. Furthermore, students must attend a mandatory guided community study session (3 hours) to contextualize their classroom learning and acquire relevant skills necessary for the successful completion of the service-learning project (Part B). It is important to note that this course structure incorporates some flexibility to allow instructors, who are willing to take on this challenging course and coach students through their service learning projects, to make micro-adjustments during the course’s operation.\n\n1.

Since the genetic sequences of human beings and many different organisms become available, their role in biological processes and diseases become more understood and comprehensible to human beings. Possibilities of making good use of such bioinformatics knowledge and manipulation of genes have opened a brave new world for us. Genetic engineering of biological organisms aims to help human beings resolve problems associated with our sustainability on planet earth in various aspects of health and medical cares, food and energy supply, environmental sustainability, industrial production and monitoring, etc, all of which have significant impacts on our society as a whole, despite some might cause much debate.",

      "description": "Everything we see around in the world today is more or less a product of financing and investments activities. The home we live in, the car or train we ride on, or the food we eat, all these pass through various economic cycles to reach us in their present form. Yet in the aftermath of financial crises there is a big misunderstanding among the masses as to what finance and investments is. There are so many cases about fallen integrity involving financial institutions and finance practitioners that generally people have started associating finance and investments with tricks and fraudulent practices. Understanding finance and investment thus becomes essential so we can go beyond such narrow narratives and understand finance better to live our lives productively and fully, irrespective of what job we chose for ourselves as we grow.This course enlightens students about investments, various institutions of modern financial world, important financial instruments and ethical standards expected of us while operating in this world and about money itself and this trains them up whether they chose a salaried job or become an entrepreneur. Young students who are curious about the “magic” and mechanics of the financial world (of which Hong Kong is one of the key centres), or if they are mystified about the inner workings of certain difficult and arcane financial transactions, this course will demystify this whole “alchemy” of financial world. The course is simple for students from any stream to follow, based on dozens of real life stories told by an industry expert and a story teller.",

Emotion dysregulation, however, disrupts normal mental processes and impairs psychosocial functioning. This course is designed to provide students with the most updated scientific knowledge about what emotions are, how emotion dysregulation results in different emotional disorders (e.g. anxiety disorders and mood disorders), and what one can do to overcome emotional disturbances and transform emotions into positive forces which serve adaptive purposes. Throughout this course, students will learn about the nature of emotions, how emotions affect different mental processes, symptoms of different emotional disorders, and as a preventive measure, different effective techniques of emotion regulation.",

More than ever we need people who believe in and are skilled at collaborating, who can effectively guide group dialogues, enhance community involvement, leverage collective wisdom for addressing complex issues. Facilitators are skilled collaborators. Facilitators strive to cultivate shared purposes, multiple perspectives, team synergy and eventually a path to building communities that connect with the deepest human values of trust, empathy and creativity for the good of all.This course aims to equip students with facilitation theories, mindset and foundational skills, including:1. The background and development of facilitation2. What is facilitation and the core values of facilitation3. Advancing leadership / group development through applying facilitation methodologies for dialogue, decision making and conflict resolution4. Exploration of personal core values and how these connect to the core values of facilitation5. Acknowledgment of own gifts and barriers as facilitatorsThis course is suitable for those students who need to organize student activities within the College, guide group learning and reflection, brainstorm and implement innovative solutions for complex and dynamic issues.",

What impacts have facilitators created? (Link to “Global Citizenship and Social Enterprisingness”) Students will be put into small groups to interview facilitators across the globe for first hand research on application and impact of facilitation. They will also have an opportunity to apply some soft skills they have learnt from Sessions 1-2 during the interviews and data consolidation. |\n| Session 4 | The commitment and praxis of facilitator (part I) – facilitator’s presence for safety, trust and connection, linking with the founding inspiration of Shaw College – “learning, innovation and benefiting mankind” (Value in action: Empathy) |\n| Session 5 | The commitment and praxis of facilitator (part II) – leveraging collective wisdom through engagement strategies, linking with the founding inspiration of Shaw College – “learning, innovation and benefiting mankind” (Value in action: Diversity and Inclusion) |\n| Session 6 | The commitment and praxis of facilitator (part III) – transforming group and individuals with facilitated dialogue processes (Value in action: Courage) |\n| *Sessions 4 - 6 focus on building students’ facilitative leadership. We will also contrast how living the value of facilitation is different from traditional, hierarchical, authoritative leadership, and why this is important for developing global citizenship, as well as thriving in today’s VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) environment.* | |\n| Session 7 | Meeting facilitation (based on Technology of Participation / Institute of Cultural Affairs) |\n| Session 8 | Exercise for meeting facilitation |\n| Session 9 | Decision making facilitation (based on research of participatory decision making processes) |\n| Session 10 | Conflict facilitation (based on Nonviolent Communication) |\n| Session 11 | Exercise for decision making facilitation |\n| Session 12 | Discovery of personal values and purpose as facilitators |\n| Session 13 | Facilitating closure and new beginning |\n| *We will also arrange optional tutorials for interested students to learn more about facilitation methodologies we use to design the GE course sessions. They can learn about the methods, the theory behind the methods, the skills required to deliver the method and also the application scenarios.
