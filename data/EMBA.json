      "description": "This course introduces a framework to guide private and family businessesâ€™ long-term planning. In the course, students seek to understand how entrepreneurs and their family members provide unique assets and contributions leading to the success of the firms, and how various roadblocks challenge the sustainability of the family firm model. It can be realized that the family assets and roadblocks are similar across firms, countries and cultures, and therefore a general framework can be applied to address critical governance decisions including family governance, ownership structures, executive compensation and promotion, and succession and exit, with the aim of improving the well-being of both the firms and the families behind them.",
