      "description": "This course is an introduction to literary China by studying the dialogue between words and images in Chinese literature. It will examine the historical evolution of Chinese culture and literature in various forms at different times. Emphasis will be given to fictional works, films and culture of the modern and contemporary periods. Specific topics will be assigned together with audio-visual texts for weekly discussions.Where does one begin to understand China with all its complicated history and culture? How can the knowledge of Chinese culture and literature elucidate and broaden the notion of the human with all its more-than-human implications? Can China and literature be used to generate meanings and ideas to explain the current (non)human conditions? Starting with these questions, this survey course focuses on three keywords: China, Literature, and the Human Condition to help students to gain knowledge about global Chinese and Sinophone culture, history, politics, and religion in the 20th and 21st centuries by using literary and visual texts as methods. From traditional socialist realist fiction to sci-fi, from gender perspectives to queer voices, from environmental literature to articulations of the nonhuman, the course covers a wide range of writers in the larger Sinophone world, including mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia. The analytical and theoretical writings of the leading scholars of the field will also be discussed. For each week, a film is also assigned as supplementary material. Whereas the literary texts are in Chinese, the secondary readings are in English. The primary instructional language is Putonghua, but a bilingual (Chinese and English) classroom environment will also be encouraged.",

We will look at the changing status of romantic plays over these hundred years. Among the questions we’ll consider are: Are they entertainment or high art? Do they articulate subtle emotions or crude desire? Should they be kept private or publicly circulated? Students will be introduced to the plays staged in various theatrical traditions through a range of media forms, including literature, audio clips, and stage performances. The course aims to help students learn how love has been described, interpreted, and manifested differently in theatrical culture over time in China and how our conceptions of love are shaped by historical and social changes.All assigned materials will be in English or accompanied by English translation, so no previous knowledge of Chinese language or culture is required. However, students are allowed to read the assigned materials in Chinese (if there is a Chinese version) and complete all the assignments and exams in either English or Chinese.",

On the diachronic level, the course analyses lexical semantics of the counterparts of the Mandarin samples in classical Chinese to explore their differences and to find patterns of historical changes in lexical semantics of Chinese words.",

      "description": "The aim of this course is to familiarise students with the dialogic relationships between modern Chinese literature and Chinese film from a historical perspective. Thematically organised, this class will help students understand the development of both literature and film in modern China by discussing such key issues as aesthetic presuppositions, temporal and spatial settings and interpretative strategies.The sub-theme of this year’s course is the hometowns of words. What is a hometown? Is it always a place of birth? What are the relations between writers and their hometowns, real or imagined? Where are the old and new literary hometowns of global Chinese literature? How do these spaces and places condition literary productions, register historical events, and reveal socio-cultural transformations? How do they index our feelings of nostalgia, anxiety, loss, and more? Starting with these questions, this survey course invites students to embark on a journey to travel across different lands of global China and the Sinophone world from the Mainland to Taiwan, Hong Kong to the South Seas, central plains to the borderlands, and the Earth to the cosmos. While mapping the literary cartography, the course also functions as a gateway to introduce modern and contemporary Chinese and Sinophone culture and history in the 20th and 21st centuries. From traditional socialist realist fiction to sci-fi, from gender perspectives to queer voices, from environmental literature to articulations of the nonhuman, the course covers a wide range of writers who write at/about/away from home. On this journey, the analytical and theoretical writings of the leading scholars of the field will also be discussed. For each week, a film is also assigned as supplementary material. The secondary readings are all in English.",

How do the narratives and cases from global Chinese literature, film, and cultures illuminate the meanings of “disasters in narratives” and “narratives about disasters” in various crises? Using disasters and crises as methods, this course studies the major themes and trends in modern and contemporary Chinese literature across China’s mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Malaysia by treating disasters broadly as ecological and social-cultural catastrophes. The course attempts to (1) address the socio-cultural and historical background for understanding various disasters in the global Chinese-speaking and -writing world; (2) construct a literary lineage on major texts and arguments about disasters; (3) explore new contingent connections between China and the world by using disasters as an interpretive framework and lens. We will cover issues on mythologies and history, ecologies and pollutions, religion and technology, and posthuman transcendence and human-nonhuman entanglements. The texts selected include writers of conventional realist fiction, speculative fiction, and science fiction, occasionally accompanied by films and documentaries. The fields of engagement include ecocriticism, posthumanism, global Chinese studies, film studies, disaster studies, modern Chinese literature, gender, and ethnicity. The thinkers and intellectuals whose works are covered include Achille Mbembe, Agamben, Brian Bernards, Carlos Rojas, David Wang, Derrida, Foucault, Haraway, Jing Tsu, Karen Thornber, Lawrence Buell, Mingwei Song, Rob Nixon, Shu-mei Shih and more.",

      "description": "This course introduces students to three key concepts in contemporary humanities studies: media, technology, and ecology. Its goal is to contextualize these concepts through the lens of Sinophone literature and culture, and to trace a history of interaction from late Qing to present between media technology, human sense perception, and the environment. Students will learn to think through questions including, What is media technology? How and when did visual modernity emerge in China? How has experience been shaped in relation to changed perceptions of the technologized environment in the Sinophone world? How does media thinking help pry open an ethical dimension that reorients eco-techno-social relations while reaching out to the more-than-human world?Weekly topics include the reception and practice of anatomy in modern China; the sensory politics of mass media; East Asian extractivism; visual politics and animal experiment; air and atmosphere; coral and nuclear imagination; cetaceans as media, etc. Materials range from science fiction to popular science, nature writing to oral history, late Qing pictorials to contemporary documentary image. In addition to deepening students’ understanding of the texts and issues under discussion, the course also trains them to think critically – to reflect on how they can sense and act better as members of an interconnected Sinophone community.",
