      "description": "The human body can be studied through its levels of organization, with each level representing different features of life. In particular, the cellular and molecular levels enable us to appreciate how excitable cells such as neurons communicate within the human body by utilizing electrical voltages created by the movement of electrolytes across cell membranes. The generation of these micro-voltages is an important functional basis of various organ systems, such as the nervous system and the cardiovascular system. In physiology, one of the primary ions of electrolytes is the sodium ion, which plays essential roles in determining plasma osmolality, water balance and even blood pressure. In this foundation course, students will learn various aspects of basic science and organ-specific human physiology essential for an understanding of how the human body functions. Students are exposed to important concepts from both the chemical and physical sciences, which they then relate to human cell and organ functions.",
