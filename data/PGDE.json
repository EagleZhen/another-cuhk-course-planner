      "description": "Contrary to common belief, student activities are not “supplementary” to school curriculum. They comprise an indispensable part of the school curriculum and often a significant part of students’ memories of school life. As the Hong Kong school curriculum evolves, greater significance is attached to extra-curricular, academic, cross-curricular, integrated curricular and life-wide learning activities.Organizing student activities is an integral duty of educators nowadays, and it is a pre-requisite that they know how to design and implement student activities that are both safe and meaningful. This course aims to equip students with knowledge and skills required in design and implementation of student activities. The ultimate goal is to enhance both the processes and outcomes of student activities in the school curriculum and meet educational expectations on student learning through activities. Another aim is to heighten students’ awareness of safety and insurance issues in risk assessment through class activities. The course contents are as follows: 1) common goals of the school curriculum and student activities; 2) factors to consider in the design and administration of activities for formal student organizations; 3) activity guidelines, safety issues and risk assessment; 4) the types of internal and external chool activities and their implementation; 5) design and implementation of outdoor and outbound activities; 6) evaluation and documentation of student activities.",

      "description": "Contrary to common belief, student activities are not “supplementary” to school curriculum. They comprise an indispensable part of the school curriculum and often a significant part of students’ memories of school life. As the Hong Kong school curriculum reforms, greater significance is focused on extra-curricular, academic, cross-curricular, integrated curricular and life-wide learning activities. Organizing student activities is an integral duty of educators nowadays, and it is a pre-requisite that they know how to design and implement student activities that are both safe and meaningful. This course aims to equip students with knowledge and skills required in design and implementation of student activities. The ultimate goal is to enhance both the processes and outcomes of student activities in the school curriculum and meet educational expectations on student learning through activities. Another aim is to heighten students’ awareness of safety and insurance issues in risk assessment through class activities.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary. Please refer to the course outline of the respective teachers for details.)",

It is designed to provide prospective teachers with analytical tools to comprehend and review educational policies and their implementation. Educational issues and policies in Hong Kong will be analyzed from an international-comparative perspective and a local concern for efficiency and equity. With a brief historical background, the empirical analysis of policies will begin with the 1982 Llewellyn Report and then extend to other educational policy papers and reports. Topics for analysis may include: (1) the school system and the curriculum; (2) allocation, selection and examination; (3) technical and vocational education; (4) quality in school, (5) gender and class differentials in education; and (6) teacher education and qualification.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

An emphasis is placed on the investigation of major reform issues in the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan, and includes reference to the developmental experiences of Macau. These issues are also of major interest to educational reformers in Hong Kong. The course will include the following topics: (1) the pursuit of quality education; (2) curriculum reform and curriculum integration; (3) reform in teaching and teacher professionalism; (4) decentralization and school-based management; and (5) the expansion of higher education. By drawing insights from the reforms within and across societal contexts, the course aims to discern implications for the general reform movement as well as teaching and learning in Hong Kong.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

      "description": "As instituted: “This course aims to help teachers to reflect on their own values and on the ways they teach values, especially moral values, in school. Among other important considerations, students are asked whether teachers should teacher their own values in the classroom, and whether this is indeed inevitable. Taking education as a means aiming at nurturing human qualities for the sake of personal and social well-being, the course examines a range of values such as truth, beauty, goodness and sageness/ saintliness as embodied in ‘whole-person education’. The course holds that education is unavoidably value-laden and that moral values form an important core of the aims of schooling. During the course students will discuss the nature of morality and a number of important approaches to moral education, and then compare these to other types of values education. Students will also be asked to reflect upon how they understand their own personal and professional development in relation to values and moral education and how to enact their various roles in the school.” Topics included please see the lecture outline.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

It will guide inquiry into the meanings the concepts of “culture” and “education” as well as the complex relationship between them. Students will investigate Confucian humanistic spirit and its educational goal of cultivating ideal personality in the Chinese tradition. They will also address the cultural orientations which Hong Kong has inherited from Western Culture. These include the priority of knowledge and science, freedom, equality, pragmatism and individualism. While investigating different cultures students will identify and discuss how culture has influenced and continues to influence education in Hong Kong. The course also explores and helps students critique current influential subcultures and ways they can respond to these, especially within a context of increasing globalization.",

Shifting expectations require teachers to have a firm understanding of how schools operate and how reforms affect their roles both in and outside of the classroom. To effectively reshape their work in line with growing expectations teachers must commit to career long professional development and consider strategies for maximizing their effectiveness, especially in terms of learning and teaching. This course is designed to help teachers to understand and shape their roles in a reform environment. In other words it aims to help teachers to become leaders of their own professionalism. It does this in two ways, first it helps teachers understand life in schools undergoing reform and the effect this can have on their professional life. Topics covered in this area include organizational culture, micropolitics, organizational behaviour and teacher leadership. The second thrust aims to nurture teacher awareness of their own professional growth and how they can maximize the latest opportunities available in this area. Topics covered in this area include models of teacher development, stages of professional development, mentorship and internship, teacher appraisal and teacher professionalism.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

      "description": "The school context in Hong Kong has become increasingly complicated. The social and policy environment after 1997 is exerting a great impact on education. Part of this impact is that teachers risk facing litigations or their rights being evaded if they are not careful and guarded enough in their daily school lives. In order to reduce these risks, this module will introduce some of the most significant legal issues that arise in primary and secondary schools and their implications for teachers. The module will: i) explore evolving legal standards on a variety of issues including employment, school safety, student discipline, student well-being, infringement of copyright, free speech, services for students with special education needs and non-Chinese learners, sexual harassment, and violence and bullying; ii) examine educational, political, ethical, and administrative questions that legal issues often generate; iii) draw on real cases and legal/policy dilemmas that teachers are facing; and iv) provide teachers with knowledge and skills they need to make sound decisions, advance important educational objectives, and minimize legal problems.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

The course is designed for practitioners and is built around the effective implementation of Liberal Studies in Hong Kong secondary schools. Liberal Studies will be considered quite broadly and will discuss related teaching models such as, issue enquiry, project learning, critical thinking and literacy, information literacy, and value clarification. Students will explore ideas designed to cultivate liberated minds in an information age and encourage reflection on how new knowledge forms, such as digital knowledge stored and disseminated through computer-mediated media, may affect the practices of education in general and liberal studies in particular. The course will also investigate how the introduction of liberal studies in Hong Kong influences the social ecology of schools, pedagogical practice of classroom and teacher professional identity.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

      "description": "The importance of sexuality education is not merely the communication of facts, but the clarification and establishment of values. Unfortunately, this is exactly the reason why adults, including parents and teachers, often avoid frank discussions about sexuality with young people. In short, adults themselves are trapped in various contradictions and myths about sex in society, which often renders them ineffective in communicating their views and values to youth, providing high-quality sexuality education, and proactively setting effective school policies pertaining to sexuality-related behaviors.This course discusses various issues related to sexuality, particularly those that are relevant to young people. In-service and pre-service teachers will directly confront and analyze related values, identify common confusions and myths associated with youth sexuality, and examine how their own values might influence the approach they take to providing youth with education related to sexuality. Special emphasis will be given to topics that have direct relevance to adolescents’ sexual health and well-being, but are not typically covered in formal sexuality education curricula. Thus, as opposed to providing teaching methods or ready-to-use teaching materials for classroom demonstration, the primary aims are to raise educators’ awareness of these issues and to help them to proactively clarify their own values in advance of conversations with students. In doing so, they can avoid confusion, misinformation, or unsupportive responses when interacting with youth. By having clear concepts and values regarding sexuality, they can communicate accurate information, provide affirming and supportive guidance to students and advocate for evidence-based school policies in a way that best fits their own instructional contexts.Grade Descriptor: A - Outstanding performance on all learning outcomesB - High performance on some learning outcomesC - Good performance on some learning outcomesD - Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomesF - Unsatisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, or failure to meet specified assessment requirements(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

      "description": "This course employs a cross-disciplinary perspective to introduce important issues in supporting students with special educational needs (SEN) in integrated school settings. First, we examine the history, policy and principles of special education and integration in Hong Kong. We then discuss basic principles of identification and intervention for students with SEN with practical skills and examples. Curriculum and instructional issues will be deliberated. In particular, the types ofSEN covered are Specific Learning Difficulties (SpLD), Intellectual Disability (ID), Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD), Physical Disability (PD), Visual Impairment (VI), Hearing Impairment (HI), Language Impairment (LI), Non-Chinese Speaking (NCS) and Mental Illness (MI), twice exceptional (i.e. SEN with Giftedness and Talents ) will be covered. Developmental characteristics and needs of these students in secondary school years will be addressed, with a focus on enhancing teachers’ professional capacity in supporting them in the regular classroom and in whole school.",

The objective of this course is to help students understand the core concepts, theories and research of positive psychology, as well as to unpack how positive psychology and positive education can be applied in a secondary school context. To achieve these objectives, students will engage in a variety of activities, including lectures by the instructor, in-class activities, group presentation, group discussions, and individual reflections throughout the course to encourage the exchange and inspiration of ideas.The course will cover both theoretical and practical knowledge in positive psychology and positive education. For the theoretical part of this course, students will develop knowledge in key theoretical models and forefront research concepts related to positive psychology, with a particular focus on secondary school students from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. An assets-based, positive psychology approach is emphasized in the class with the aim of helping students to “learn from direct experience”. In the practical part of this course, students will acquire the skills and strategies to support the class’s academic success and flourishing.
