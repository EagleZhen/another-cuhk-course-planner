Relevant contemporary issues will be drawn extensively to explain the values of the humanities and the need for knowledge of cultural studies in the societies of Hong Kong, China and Asia.The course covers four sections to explain the breadth of knowledge that can be applied to understand how culture works. The four sections include (1) basic introduction of cultural studies as an interdisciplinary field, (2) media representation in popular culture, (3) memory, history and modernity and (4) community, urban culture and critical pedagogy. The four sections show the trajectory of applying a cultural studies point of view to understand why culture matters in today’s fast changing world.

      "description": "This course introduces students to the basic concepts and practices of public humanities, an emerging field that examines the influence of the humanities in the public sphere. It guides students through the ways in which humanistic thinking and inquiry can impact community engagement, collective cultural history and memory, policy-making, and the cultivation of empathy. Organized into three sections—Visions, Paths, and Experiments—each part focusing on different dimensions of public humanities, the course begins by exploring the conceptual foundations of public humanism, emphasizing the importance of curiosity, generosity, and collaboration. As the course progresses, students engage with real-world case studies that demonstrate how humanities initiatives can reshape culture and society. Students will also experiment with designing a small-scale collaborative project, which allows them to transform their public concerns and humanistic inquiries into concrete outcomes. These projects serve as a starting point for their further development within and beyond the programs of public humanities. The course is designed for students interested in leveraging the humanities to enrich public culture.",

Students should refine their storytelling based on their previous humanistic investigations.\n* Core readings:\n\n* Jacob Burg, “Pedagogy of and for the Public: Imagining the Intersection of Public Humanities and Community Literacy.” *Community Literacy Journal* 14, no. 2 (2020): 130-137. ***OR***\n* Jefferson Pooley, “The Impact Platform.” *Parameters* (2017).\n\n* Tutorial exercise:\n\n* Students will decide on the framing and strategies for publishing their work to the public and consider potential stakeholders with whom they can collaborate.\n\n* *Week 11: Consultation Week (Attendance required)**\n\n* *Week 12 (and 13): Group Presentation**\n\n* Students’ projects, as initial attempts in public humanities, will serve as references or prototypes for further exploration in other modules of the program. For example, a group focusing on public health in Hong Kong might develop their presentation into a humanities research project, public art project, independent film, YouTube video, etc. The skills for different cultural formats are expected to be acquired by students in other modules of the program.\n\n* *Individual final paper (1500 words):**\n\n* Each student is required to write a reflection paper on the group project in which they participated. The paper should include the following sections:\n\n* **Improvement Opportunities:** Discuss how the group project could be enhanced, including aspects such as theme, content, time management, and presentation style.\n* **Alternative Approaches:** Describe other directions the project could have taken.\n* **Learning from Peers:** Identify the best projects in the class and discuss the strengths that can be learned from them.\n* **Future Endeavors:** Explain whether you are interested in continuing and revising this project or if you prefer to explore other topics for future projects.\n\n* *Utilizing ChatGPT:** Describe how ChatGPT was used to assist in the writing of this paper.",

      "description": "This course is aimed at the students beginning their encounter with theory, in which they will learn the fundamental components of cultural criticism in terms of textuality and contextuality. Here the \" text\" is broadly defined as cultural artifacts, which includes filmic image, literary and historical narratives, social and everyday life experiences as well as media representation. The course materials are selected to give the students the basic information and guide to understand the object, the purpose and the method for cultural criticism. Topics discussed include intertextuality, defamiliarization, dramatic monologue, metaphor and montage, narratives and space-time structure, psychoanalysis and stream of consciousness, reader-response criticism and genre studies.",

      "description": "Cultural management is frequently perceived as a new terrain both for the acknowledgement of the role of culture in driving economic and social development, and for the dissemination of managerial thought to arrange and plan cultural entities, facilities and services. This course first aims to facilitate students’ understanding of the rising discipline of cultural management, which is embedded in the transformative understanding of culture and the on-going global movement that highlights culture-led development. Second, it introduces the managerial approach to cultural assets, initiates students’ understanding of the relationship between arts management and the market system and government policies, and imparts the preliminary knowledge for the management of the arts. Third, it displays a spectrum of major issues in cultural management, such as cultural policy, cultural organizations and institutions, venue management and event programming, heritage, conservation and cultural tourism and cultural creative industries. The breadth of the discipline as indicated allows students’exposure to the basic cultural management concepts and strategies.",

Students are expected to understand preliminarily the operation of art businesses and cultural organizations in connection to market values and government administrative systems. In terms of management training, students will learn practicalities such as cultural managerial principles, planning strategies and basic skills, issues, challenges and limitations specifically for the arts and cultural resources. Discussions are largely based in the local context, supplemented with overseas and Chinese cases, with an awareness of the variances across contexts.",
      "course_syllabus": "Part I. Cultural Management as a New Discipline\nThis part introduces the historical and disciplinary background of cultural management.\n\n1. Understanding Culture: history and theory\nThe first section presents an introduction to the course. As cultural management is embedded in the discourse of culture, this section explores the concept of culture and highlights the theoretical transition from the anthropological idea of culture as values and practices to the understanding of culture as a capital and resource. The emergence of the cultural economy concept will also be discussed.\n\n2. Understanding the Discipline of Cultural Management\nThis section discusses the evolution of the discipline of cultural management over the past four decades, that is, from arts management, to cultural administration and management.

It also discusses the professional role of cultural managers; their differences from artists and creative workers are highlighted.\n\n3. Cultural Management in the Globalization of Culture-led Development\nThis section examines the discipline of cultural management from the view of the global movement that utilizes culture as a driving force for development.

The objective is to understand how space as a cultural phenomenon relates to matters of ideology, social class, nationality, ethnicity and sexuality. The course will investigate the ways in which meaning about space is generated, disseminated and produced through various practices, beliefs and institutions, and how understanding of space is embedded in the political, economic, or social structures within a given culture. Examples of space making and manifestation will be taken from both Hong Kong and overseas.",

From the cultural perspective, there are different levels of travel: from \"tourism\" for pleasure, \"travel\" for different purposes, like study, works, business or military, to \"journey\" for life experience and eternal truth. This course aims to provide theoretical reflections and historical analysis on the relation between culture and travel, and in particular, the wide range of symbolisms of cultural experience of travel. It will be able to help students explore the process of crosscultural interactions as well as the knowledge of cross-cultural management in travel.",

      "description": "(UGEC2245 is double-coded with CURE2007.) Celebrity culture is generally understood as a cult full of short-lived trends and inconsequential fan behaviour. We seldom consider, however, the powerful influence it has over our cultural identities. This course examines how the interplay between celebrity culture and the cultural industry shapes cultural identity with case studies from Hong Kong as the major scope of study. Starting with a brief history of Hong Kong celebrity culture from the 1980s to the present day, the course offers an entry point for students to understand the intricate relationship between the media and celebrity culture, encompassing a wide range of cultural icons and phenomena such as action film actors, cross-media megastars, and YouTube micro-celebrities. Each case study will engage with key concepts in celebrity culture, such as star-text, commodification, authenticity, extratextual reading, and participatory reading. The course proceeds by introducing the critical perspective of cultural studies in making sense of representation politics, public culture, fandom studies, and the diverse modes of intimacy in the digital age. Overall, students will gain an understanding of celebrity culture and how identities are thus produced, promoted, and commodified in the wider arena of media and popular culture.",

Students will learn about the history, the rationale, the benefits, and the challenges of digital humanities. Each week, the lecture will introduce the historical trajectory of the fields’ development, its new configurations with the emergent technologies (such as Natural Language Processing and Language models). From week three onwards, each lecture will also include a short section focused on introducing a DH tool. Tutorials are dedicated times for students to put theories to work and to experiment with the DH tool of the week. By the end, students will have the skills to create, analyze, and critique digital humanities projects. Students will also learn to critique the field's practices and contributions. This course will explore the intersection of technology and culture and discover how students can shape the future of humanities research.",

With the help of contemporary cultural theories, we engage in theoretical discussions about the complex issues related to the body, covering topics of identity, society, gender, and sexuality. The aim of the subject is to help students to understand the cultural myths and the rich meanings of the human body, so that we can most intimately examine the formation of our identity and value system.",

      "description": "Dance is historically entwined with many cultures around the world. Dance has certainly played a significant role of ceremony, rituals, celebrations and entertainment since before the birth of the earliest human civilizations. This course provides an understanding of the history, evolution, and universality of dance as an art form. Further, viewing dance as a social and cultural practice, the course aims at analyzing dance semantics and meanings in gestures, the interrelationship of dance and space, theatrical design and costumes, the formation of a dance to its social background, customs, as well as concepts of the self representation and embodiment in their dancing.  In particular, students will have opportunities to experience learning the gestures encoded symbolic meanings with narratives of dances. To demonstrate a physical understanding of a variety of dance forms, this course allows them to explore the pleasure of creative process of choreography in workshops.",

Ecological crisis, environmental degradation, and extreme weathers have become the watchwords of contemporary politics. The conventional boundaries between “nature” and “culture” are now being questioned. How do nature, culture and power intersect in our everyday life? How do we get to understand issues of sustainability and environmental crisis from a broad historical perspective and global activism angle? How are gender, class and race interact with technology, damaged environment, animal and plant species? This course explores these questions and the rich debates in the emerging field of environmental humanity and literature of the Anthropocene.Class topics are organized on major global green movements that resisted oil pollution, toxic factories, logging companies, dam constructions and nuclear plant building. Students get to learn the historical developments of major environmental activism in the West and the global south. How was the Greenpeace founded? What is the Narmada Dam Movement in India? Do you know Ken Saro-Wiwa, an environmental activist against Shell oil pollution in Nigeria? In each class we examine historical texts, visual materials and theoretical debates to explore how environmental justice has been intertwined with histories of colonialism, neoliberalism, and questions of gender, race, poverty and class. Together the class explores the problem of the Anthropocene (Nature) in the context of colonial history, grass root struggles (Culture) and corporation greed (Power).This course addresses many of the 17 United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Climate Actions (13), Life on Land (15), Life below Water (14), Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (16), Clean Energy (7), Reduced Inequalities (10), and Gender Inequality (5).

      "credits": "3.00",
      "terms": [],
      "description": "This course is an introduction to the medical humanities, an interdisciplinary field of study that seeks to understand the social context of health and illness beyond the hospital, clinic, and laboratory. In particular, this course will emphasize the historical and cultural shaping of health disparities and examine how issues of power contribute to unequal patterns of risk and disease in our modern society. To do this, students will learn major theories and methods in the cultural study of health and medicine to understand how culture, power, and identity—including race, gender, capitalism, and colonialism— shapes the management of disease and individual illness experience in both Asian and global contexts. A critical concern in this course is how the organization of medical care confronts questions of social justice in medical treatment and public health in historical and contemporary contexts. Students will also grapple with the question of whether our institutions of medicine and public health function as a form of social control. By introducing students to the social components of health and illness, it aims to foster cross-disciplinary conversations across the faculties of arts, medicine, and other divisions at CUHK.Following the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of Reducing Inequality (SDG #10), a central question in this course is how medical treatments, research, and public health confront, or fail to confront, issues of social justice in global contexts. Students will learn theoretical approaches to health and inequality to investigate how history, culture, and politics shape the illness experience of socially marginalized people. These theories will enable students to assess the strengths and limits of our current arrangements of medical care and approaches to global health. In addition, students will learn critical medical humanities methods, such as ethnography, and use these methods to propose solutions to our current shortcomings in health governance. This course will challenge students to imagine better alternatives to our unequal world and demonstrate why the study of culture matters in medicine, global health, and public policy.",

      "course_syllabus": "* *Introduction: Critical Medical Humanities**\n\nIn this introductory class, students will learn about the critical medical humanities as a method for interrogating fundamental questions of social justice in medicine: who gets sick, who gets better, and why? Students will be introduced to basic theories and concepts in the cultural studies of health and disease, such as stigma, biopolitics, and illness discourse, as tools for analyzing the complex social forces that shape health disparities. In addition, students will be provided with a basic introduction to public health systems, as well as information about the places and time periods that will be covered in the course.\n\n* *Unit One: Race and Disease**\n\nThis unit starts with the histories of international disease control in Asian contexts, with emphasis on how social, cultural, and racial differences shaped the management of disease in colonial spaces. Students will analyze how issues of power and identity inform public health interventions, which often protects the privileged while stigmatizing and harming others. We will use the Hong Kong plague outbreak of 1894 as a case study in health inequity and learn, for example, about the homes of migrant Chinese labourers being burned by colonial officials in the name of disease control. We will conclude the unit by reflecting on how ideas of race and other forms social difference still shape the framing of disease even in contemporary discourses. Students will utilize cultural theories on race, gender, class, and inequality to identify how social biases shapes disease perception and response to reduce health inequality.\n\n* *1. Difference and Disease in Tropical Medicine**\n\nKey themes: hygienic modernity, power/knowledge, the “native” body, the laboratory in colonial discourse, vaccine politics\n\n* *2. Colonial Tensions in Hong Kong’s Plague Pandemic**\n\nKey themes: race and space, epidemic orientalism, the politics of quarantine and sanitary regimes, germ theory vs. local knowledge\n\n* *3. Representing Disease**\n\nKey themes: cultural representations of “the other” in disease discourse, endemicity as a cultural concept, body politics, the role of media in shaping disease response, global health\n\n* *Unit Two: The Politics of Identity in Medicine**\n\nWhy are doctors often men? Why do doctors often come from socially dominant groups in terms of ethnicity and class privilege? What are the implications for how medicine is practiced? This unit offers answers to some of these questions by exploring the power structures that shape our institutions of medicine. We start with examining the social power of physicians. Students will learn about the social factors that shape how medical conditions come to be recognized, and the populations that are excluded or harmed in the pursuit of medical advancement. By understanding the politics of identity in medicine, students will gain the conceptual tools for understanding the health disparities that result when medicine often reflects the interests of socially dominant groups. Course discussions will invite students to apply concepts learned in this unit to address health disparities here in Hong Kong, where ethnic minorities representing 8.4% of the population face barriers in accessing care, mental health resources are not yet able to address demand, and a fragile public health system offers diminished care for the city’s neediest.\n\n* *4. Physician Power**\n\nKey themes: medicalization, normal vs. pathological, social control, illness narrative\n\n* *5. Medical Experimentation**\n\nKey themes: medical mistrust, medical gaze, ethical variation, biopolitics, bare life\n\n* *6. Gender and Medicine I**\n\nKey themes: gender discrimination in medicine, bias in clinical research, androcentrism, experiential knowledge, situated knowledge\n\n* *7. Gender and Medicine II**\n\nKey themes: patient activism, advocacy, biosociality, online communities\n\n* *Unit Three: Medicine, Power, and Structural Violence**\n\nIn this final unit, we will connect individual illness experiences to the broader social, economic, and structural factors that result in ill health, such as poverty, uneven development, forced migration, and others. This unit will emphasize the illness experiences of marginalized social groups to examine the effects of social, political, and economic disenfranchisement on their bodies and health. By examining health and illness at the level of everyday life, students will develop an understanding of how ethnographic methods can be used to make interventions in health policy. In the concluding week, we will wrap up with a discussion about who benefits, and who may be harmed, in our current global health system and propose ways to align global health priorities with the principles health justice.\n\n* *8. Structural Violence and Health Disparities**\n\nKey themes: structural violence, embodiment, subjectivity, illness narrative, decolonization\n\n* *9. Health and Human Rights**\n\nKey themes: health justice, migrant health, human rights, social safety nets, undocumented\n\n* *10. Neoliberal Logics in Global Health**\n\nKey themes: biomedicalization, clinical trials, commodification of health, globalization\n\n* *11. Conclusion: Inequality in Global Health Systems**",

Feminists fight for equality by publications, demonstrations and organizations. In 20th century, the feminist movement matured. Feminists have been more sensitive to the differences among women of different race, class, culture, religion and circumstances and noticed the importance of differences in unity. This course will introduce the strategies and main arguments of various kinds of feminism. Through learning from others’ experience, history and our daily life, we will understand the development of diversity in feminisms. We can have more understanding of feminists fighting for the right of disadvantage groups by self-review and mutual criticism in different times and culture.",

It will explore not just the work of a wide array of film directors, but also the texts and the condition of their production, distribution, exhibition and consumption within a transnational framework, all of which impinge on the question of “national” film historiography. It will examine, in particular: the socio-political background of the emergence of the Taiwan New Cinema movement, its key directors and their works, the international context of their reception and the transnational nature of their production, and its legacy to date. It will provide students with an in-depth knowledge of the work of selected film authors and an awareness of the cinematic, cultural, and socio-political contexts in which they work, and enable students to analyse the work in relation to questions of transnationality and historiography.",

Other topics such as advertising and pop culture, broadcasting (narrowcasting on the Net), merchandising and iconography in fashion will be examined to review key contemporary issues and debates about cultural consumption. Bringing together work on reception theory in literary studies and philosophy, studies on consumer culture in anthropology and sociology and those on media audiences within media studies, we will address the consequences and effects of increasing cultural commodifiaction and globalization, by exploring into the complex interactions of cultural production and consumption which are relevant in topics such as place and identity, visual culture and hyperreality, representation and communication technologies. Films and animations will be viewed outside class time. Field trips may be arranged.",

Here we are going to de-familiarize consumer society and our daily consumption practices, in order to learn how patterns of consumption work, and to consider consequences of such culture.\n\nWe approach the topics with a number of theoretical perspectives, arguments, and illustrations. Students are expected to look into these everyday occurrences with sociological, anthropological, literary, and philosophical analytical tools. This course may help us reflect not only on our relationship with commodity in general, but also our increasingly mediated connection to the world, our community, and even to ourselves. The mediation as such is not so much in the traditional, materialistic sense of use and pleasurable experience, as melting of all that is solid into signs and their consumption. Emphasis will be placed on developing students’ analytical as well as cultural critical skills, or in other words, ability to un-learn the born-again consumer.\n\n1) Knowledge Outcomes\nTheories and perspectives of contemporary consumption culture\nCharacteristics of consumer culture and their global nature\nConsequences and ethical appropriation of consumerism\n\n2) Skill Outcomes\nArticulating theories and practices in understanding phenomena of consumption\nCreative project making to address to some of the obvious problems in consumerism\n\n3) Attitude Outcomes\nBalance between critical and pedagogical approach\nCreative learning and un-learning through everyday life experiences",

      "description": "This course studies the relationship between youth and popular culture, specifically in view of the rapidly expanding youth culture in recent years. We explore the importance of the factor of age in the study of popular culture, explaining why youths are vulnerable to the manipulation of popular culture, and why their lifestyles and values also dominate popular culture. We also examine how youth identity is constructed around the dynamics between mainstream identity and subcultural identity, and students are given the chance to analyse their own socio-cultural worlds in the various cultural environment, including home, school, concerts, shopping malls, youth magazines, and the cyber-space. This course provides students with an understanding of why youths, in particular, are prone to collective identity, and how they achieve their sense of self through fashion, music, sports, and entertainment.",

      "description": "Queer Theories emerged in the 1990s as some of the most vital analytical tools in the fields of Gender Studies and Cultural Studies. This course offers students an opportunity to study this strand of critical thought in-depth. It will examine theories of queer from four major approaches, namely: historical, political, reading and performative. Topics of the course will cover a wide range of subjects including identities, sexualities, temporalities, homophobia, activism, deviance, and transgression. This course is particularly suited for students who would like to acquire the knowledge of a particular theoretical approach and to engage it in a critical examination of literature and culture today.",

      "description": "This course analyses how Asian bodies and identities are represented in media and visual fantasy cultures such as Japanese animation, social networks, and performative subcultures. We explore how the extreme cultural and social diversity of the Asian region contributes to unique perspectives on bodies and identities. We are particularly interested in the studies of trans-Asian cultural flows, which includes not only commodities and entertainments but also migrations, like workers, and specific thoughts, like Maoism or human rights. We believe that a careful reading of these transnational flows would help us reconsider what Hong Kong culture and Chinese culture mean in contemporary bodies and indentity. We compare the cultural studies of local cultures with the discourses of trans-Asian studies and globalization, with the aim to demonstrate the possible ideological traps and strengths of taking Asia as an academic category for studying the body and culture.",

It is a course draws on a wide variety of disciplines including social sciences, semiotics, speech-act theory, psychoanalysis, gender and queer studies, with which we can investigate the stylistic features, the quality of theatricality, the technical change, the hybridity and the boundary-crossing of performance in our era.",

      "description": "(UGED2326 is double-coded with CURE2051.)   Nowadays comic strip has become one of the major forms of visual narratives in our culture. Both comics and film are visual arts originally developed within the period of late 19th century and early 20th century. Although film has long ago established its artistic legitimacy, comic art still struggle for recognition. However, as Will Eisner put it, comic strip is a “Sequential Art” and has its own unique aesthetic nature. This course tries to inquire the governing aesthetic principles of comics and investigate its unique method of expression. We will also try to delineate the special communication mode of comics and its relationship with different aspects of modern society and culture. Students will learn to appreciate comic art from different perspectives, and strengthen analytical skills for visual media.",

The first part of this course will be dedicated to a study of some recent models of textual studies in the field of Chinese Buddhism. The second part of this course will be devoted to an analysis of a text chosen from the Chinese Buddhist canon. The text will be studied critically through a historical analysis of the circumstances surrounding the creation and dissemination of the text. The choice of text will be based on the interest of the students but it will be chosen among some of the most representative traditions of Chinese Buddhism such as the Chan, the Tiantai, or the Huayen School of Buddhism.",

      "description": "The aim of this course is to introduce students to the Taoist literature in Chinese history. While there are many approaches to the understanding of the discipline of religion and literature, this course covers traditional Chinese literature in relation to Taoist thought, practice, institution, and symbolism. The focus is on the formation of literary genres as religious expression and transcendental imagination in the context, as much as possible, of the development of Taoist religion. This will allow us not only to realize literature as the principal record of Taoist tradition in its confirmation and valorization of Taoist values, but also to grapple with the literary challenge to inherited orthodoxies and thus the undermining of conventional ideas and feelings, as well as to sample the texture of literature functioning as an alternative or substitute for Taoism. In this way, we can approach the intersections of the aesthetic and the religious as the essential humanity through the reading and analysis of the Taoist dimensions of literature.",

How can religious aspects such as symbols, myths, taboos, rituals, and practices help us understand body, healing, medicine, gender fluidity, and sexual practices?Rather than simply dividing religions into different traditions, this course takes a thematic approach and examines religion, gender and sexuality as crucial systems of power that shape our world. Students will develop an understanding of religion and gender as both subjects and as categories of analysis. As categories of analysis, students will use gender and religion to interrogate cultural production and social systems, paying close attention to how gender and religion intersect with other categories of social difference. Students will connect the assigned academic readings to “real-life” examples in the news, media, and their own lives, thereby producing new theoretical understandings of gender, religion, and sexuality in the contexts of Hong Kong, Asia, and the world.",

Assuming basic Latin competency, we will advance through increasingly complex grammatical structures, with particular emphasis on: Middle and passive voices, Infinitive constructions, Subjunctive clauses and their sequence, Participial phrases and ablative absolute, Gerunds and gerundives, Complex relative clauses, Indirect discourse, and Conditional sentences.The course centers on intensive study of selected classical prose, primarily from Cicero and Seneca, supplemented by readings from other classical authors. These authors provide an excellent progression in syntactical complexity while offering varied prose styles. Through these readings, students will strengthen their command of advanced Latin grammar, expand their vocabulary, and develop sophisticated translation techniques. Special attention will be given to developing sight-reading skills and mastering complex syntactical structures. By the end of the course, students will be prepared to approach advanced Latin literature with greater confidence and analytical skill.",

The first develops core Latin language competency, covering essential grammar including noun declensions, verb conjugations, and basic syntax. The second component applies this linguistic foundation to specialized vocabulary and concepts across disciplines, including philosophical terminology, psychological concepts, legal principles, sociological terms, and historical discourse. Students will learn to analyze and construct complex terms through understanding Latin roots, prefixes, and suffixes common in humanities and social science discourse. By course completion, students will be able to comprehend and correctly use Latin-derived terminology in academic and professional contexts, while acquiring sufficient Latin language foundation to pursue intermediate Latin studies if desired.",

      "description": "Latin for Science and Medicine introduces students to fundamental Latin language structures while focusing on scientific and medical terminology. This course requires no prior knowledge of Latin and welcomes students from all academic backgrounds. While particularly relevant for those pursuing studies in sciences, healthcare, and related fields, the course provides all students with valuable insights into scientific and medical concepts through the lens of Latin terminology.The course is structured in two complementary components. The first develops core Latin language competency, covering essential grammar including noun declensions, verb conjugations, and basic syntax. The second component applies this linguistic foundation to specialized vocabulary and concepts in scientific and medical fields, including biological taxonomy, anatomical terminology, pharmaceutical nomenclature, and scientific processes. Students will learn to analyze and construct complex technical terms through understanding Latin roots, prefixes, and suffixes common in scientific discourse. By course completion, students will be able to comprehend and correctly use Latin-derived terminology in scientific and medical contexts, while acquiring sufficient Latin language foundation to pursue intermediate Latin studies if desired.",

This course aims to bring students in touch with the major religious traditions and cultural patterns of India. It also aims to awaken appreciation and understanding of how diverse peoples of India negotiate their lives within this complex religious and cultural landscape. The main question and thematic thread running through the course will be how the various traditions understand, express, and practice embodiment and transcendence. In other words, what are the constituents, changes, relationships, and possibilities for human beings and divinities with reference to the temporal world and transcendent reality? Where can we find significant \"family resemblances\" – without ignoring differences – among the diversities of persons and sub-traditions within those roughly designated Hindu, Jain, Buddhist, Muslim, Sikh, or Christian?",

      "description": "The course examines the correlation between art and institutions in twentieth-century China, aiming to encourage students to think about modern Chinese art through the concept of the artworld. The downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republican China transformed the social and institutional organisation of the production, distribution, and consumption of art as well as the traditional patronage system in modern China. The structural changes conditioned the emergence of formal and informal art institutions that facilitated yet constrained artistic practices, laying the foundation for the development of a modern art world in China. The course looks at the history of modern Chinese art and the formation of different art institutions in the sociocultural and economic context of modern China. Weekly topics are structured chronologically and thematically, which cover a wide range of themes, including art schools, art societies, museums, exhibitions, and art market. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, the course offers students multi-perspectives to understand the transformation of modern Chinese art and the interactions between artistic practices and society in modern China.",

      "description": "Cultural heritage management presents a complex landscape influenced by globalization, urbanization, cultural place-making projects, technological advancements, economic development, and diverse applications in both the preservation of history and the creative industries. As cities expand and integrate globally, the challenge of preserving local cultural identities while balancing heritage conservation with modern urban needs becomes increasingly significant. In recent years, technological innovations and the development of smart cities have enhanced accessibility and supported cultural initiatives, transforming heritage preservation. However, issues of sustainability and resilience in dynamic urban environments worldwide have also emerged as critical topics and debates within cultural heritage management.This course aims to provide students with an introductory knowledge of cultural heritage management, along with the theoretical frameworks that shape our understanding of cultural heritage. It covers policy at international, national, and local levels, conservation and restoration practices, funding and resource management, and ethical considerations. While highlighting the significance of intangible cultural heritage, this course will also examine the impact of tourism and the vital role of community involvement, intersecting with issues of identity, technology, urban planning, and conflict. By offering a variety of foundational concepts and real-world case studies, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of current practices and challenges in cultural heritage management.",

A general model that is applicable to a variety of cultural organizations for performance evaluation is presented first. Then, the methods for evaluating the performances of museum and performing art organizations are discussed. The section also introduces for performing art organizations a qualitative model from the perspective of the audience’s experiences. In terms of museum performance measurement, the section provides an evaluation model that comprises a range of indicators, including validity, reliability, feasibility, and externality.\nTutorial: Discuss cultural organization performance evaluation.\nAssignment: Write Items 1 to 3, organize the materials for Item 9 in the business plan, and prepare the presentation for the group project.\n\n13. Reviews and Discussions\nStudents are expected to deliver their group outputs, consisting of business plans with all the required elements in Byrne, 2009, pp. 32–33s.

      "description": "(UGED2286 is double-coded with CURE2406.)  The exhibition has become a site of knowledge production and a prominent and diverse part of contemporary culture. Regarding “Chinese art” as a social constructed concept, the course uses “exhibition” as an entry point to engage with issues concerning Chinese art and to explore the role played by exhibitions in the formation of the knowledge of Chinese art. It introduces the current theories and debates on the theory and history of exhibition, and the display methods, examining the changing concept of Chinese art and curatorial practices through detailed analysis of case studies. The first part of the course traces the formation of the concept of “Chinese art” by looking closely at the history of exhibitions on Chinese objects from the late Qing dynasty to the early twentieth century. The second part examines important exhibitions that have shaped our understanding of Chinese art. Structured thematically, the course discusses the curatorial concepts of selective significant international exhibitions on Chinese art, and investigate how scholarly research has been transformed into exhibitions which have shaped our understanding of Chinese art, constructed identity and been deployed for political ends.",

      "description": "“Curating,” a word that was once only used in museums, now has applications in everything in our lives, ranging from radio station DJs to almost all types of social media content. The popularity of the word reflects the growing importance of assembling, managing and presenting data and collection, a process of gathering information that brings maximum value relevant to different audiences.In this context, this course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to learn about both historical and contemporary examples of how culture is understood through exhibition design and curating. By covering various forms of curatorial traditions, disruptive ideas, and emergent digital practices in the ever-expanding field of curation, this course equips students with the ability to question what they take for granted and reflect on existing issues conducive to different cultures, values and beliefs. By the end of the course, students will be able to critically examine how knowledge is created inside and outside of art institutions and how curation could potentially become public knowledge.",

      "description": "The artworld is constructed through a network of individuals and institutions, all of which participate in con-tributing to the wider ecosystem of the global network and marketplace for art. The co-generative or mutu-ally constitutive nature between key players and institutions provides the context and rules for evaluating the aesthetic and economic value of art objects. In recent years, the art market has witnessed tremendous growth, and clusters of new galleries, global art fairs and auction houses have sprung up in cities within both developed and emerging economies, forming an ever-expanding network of art transitions, exhibi-tions, and causing an explosion of cultural activities amid various forms of urbanization. This course aims to provide students with theoretical knowledge and practical skills on how to identify the dynamic roles and activities of key players and institutions in the art market. It begins with an introduction to the history of art market, patronage system and art market logic. The, various practical skills are covered, including art valuation methods, techniques of buying and selling art, and agreements and laws that govern art transactions. In addition to practical skills, this course also encourages students to critically evaluate the complex relationships between the economy, aesthetic values and social behaviors within the global market-place.

      "description": "This course leads students to study various modes and philosophies of visual arts management undertaken in different venues. Aesthetics and art criticisms are critical in directing art interpretation and presentation. Contemporary management of visual arts responds predominantly to the worldwide discussions on modernism as well as various post-modernist writings. In addition, it has to operate in accordance with the prescribed state policy. For this bilateral concern of art management, the course comprises two sections. The first section leads students to study the writings on aesthetics by critics from Plato to Foucault, whose arguments are still valid in inspiring many art exhibitions. The second section discusses the practical concerns and techniques in maximizing the social and economic impacts of art exhibitions and relevant events. Both sections discuss case studies taken from different parts of the world.",

      "description": "(UGEC3481 is double-coded with CURE3003.)  How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William’s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals’ life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park – Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla – Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo – Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.",

      "description": "We are now experiencing fast developments in technoscience in the modern world. As everything turns electronic and hi-tech, e.g., email, ebanking, ecommerce, plus the newly developed sciences such as cloning, biogenetic engineering, etc., it is important to introduce to students the ways technosciences and mass media bear on our sense of identity and subjectivity. The aim of this course is to help students make sense of different ramifications of contemporary technosciences which have unprecedentedly transformed their everyday life experiences, in other words, to introduce them to the study of technoscience culture. Through a body of fiction, films, T.V. shows, computer mediated communication devices, cybercultural forms (VR and AI), etc., which deal directly with new communication technologies, this class will highlight the radical effects on the centrality of visual culture in the modern world, on the post-modernist self and on virtuality of all kinds.",

Different approaches of cultural criticism will be practised, from textual, formalistic to ideological ones, realizing each power and limitation. Writing styles (e.g. interpretive, provocative, deconstructive, prescriptive) and the related critics' roles will be examined too. Students will be encouraged to put their understanding of cultural theory in general to current cultural issues happening in the society at large. Both reading and writing will be stressed, with the aim of enlarging their reading scope (e.g. from local to China Mainland to foreign media) and enriching their hands-on writing experience.",

      "description": "(UGEC3482 is double-coded with CURE3033.) This course is a survey of Southeast Asian cinema read against the backdrop of its distinct historical, political, ecological, and cultural conditions. Initially a Cold War construct comprising Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, and Timor-Leste, the term ‘Southeast Asia’ has come to refer to a highly complex and pluralistic region of over 660 million people, 25,000 islands, and 150 ethnolinguistic communities. With its national identities formed from the encounter with and struggle against American, British, French, Dutch, Hispanic, Indian, Japanese, and Chinese influence, Southeast Asia’s movies have served as venues for propaganda and resistance. This course looks at how the remediations of different genres such as noir, melodrama, western, and sci-fi tackle controversial issues of gender, race, religion, poverty, migration, and the environment. Instead of smoothening the continuity of official historical narratives, it uncovers how documentaries, epics, and horror reexamine the trauma of past colonization, authoritarianism, and violence. To conclude, the course explores how television serials, anthology films, and online databases trace nascent cross-border and intra-regional communities beyond the limits of sovereignty.",

      "description": "(UGEC3483 is double-coded with CURE3034.)This course aims to introduce Korean society and culture through Korean Popular Culture in relation to media and cultural studies scholarship and its socio-cultural contexts. In particular, we will examine the meaning of media and culture and its social changes in contemporary Korea through exploring various emerging trends and cultural studies as methodological tool within modern and contemporary Korean issues. Global popularity of Korean popular culture and the transnational Hallyu (Korean Wave) boom continue to percolate beyond Asia and inspire various critical questions regarding trans-nationalism, cultural imperialism and musical authenticity and hybridity. The course readings engage wide range of various issues and arguments of media and cultural studies scholarship as methodological tools; such as cultural representation, meaning of hegemony, cultural industry/economy and globalism of media, post colonialism, audience of mass media and fandom culture, gender and queer issues, and then further focus on the specific context of Korean popular culture including the pivotal notions of colonial modernity, Japanese imperialism, cultural hegemony in colonial Korea, meaning of Americanization, issues of popular memory and decolonization discourses, nationalism and globalization and Korean Wave, body/gender/sexuality / LGBTQ issue in Korean Media and Popular culture, cyber culture and internet memes, transnationalism and diaspora issues and its aftermath. We actively discuss various audio-visual artifacts including Korean news, music video, films, TV dramas, and pop music in each class in order to understand better the texts and contexts within the historical and sociocultural paradigm of recent sociology, media/communication studies scholarship.",

      "description": "Contemporary art has emerged as a privileged domain for exploring interspecies relations where various contemporary issues intersect. Thus, this course aims to introduce contemporary art and its representational aesthetics to consider various socio-cultural issues regarding art circulation and its interpretation, the connotation of contemporary art in society. The works of various contemporary artists will be presented in the context of focal issues that invoke social practices, conventional modality of contemporary art scene, shifting art interpretation within the norms and values in a society, relational art and public engagement, experimental use of media. In each week we will analyze contemporary art with specific themes, emphasizing the recurrent motifs and issues in contemporary art and its politics of representation, such as situation and activism, space, ruin and urbanity/modernity, trauma and memory in history, animality and non-human subjectivity, post-human and prosthetic body, gender and sexuality, queer art, magic (the material culture of the weird and eerie, ghost and monstrous iconography), cuteness as a concept reflecting from the contemporary popular cultural reference. Close readings in both academic and art critical practices, class discussion and participation will culminate in a final individual research paper interrogating the implications of representational tactics and strategies of a single artist and/or artwork in contemporary art.",

      "description": "This course prepares students to learn from the emerging practices of community making. Through an introduction to the basic concepts, exploration of the origins, development, and implementation, students will understand the emerging intervention methods of humanities in the public domain.Community making is closely related to sustainable development, involving the application of interdisciplinary theories. Special attention will be given to practical case studies in this course, helping students examine community making practices in the local and neighboring regions, including Japan, Mainland China, and Taiwan. Students will also have the opportunity to personally understand the lived experiences of different communities/groups, and cross-reference them with relevant theories to deepen their understanding.In this course, students will acquire knowledge on how community making affects community cultural history, construction of collective identity, community participation, cross-sectoral collaboration, and the accumulation of social capital. This course will guide students to initially grasp the roles and collaborative dynamics among the diverse stakeholders in the community, including government departments, social welfare organizations, civic groups, and community organizations, as well as advisory frameworks.",

      "description": "This course explores the art of writing across various formats and media. Designed to enhance students’ critical and creative capabilities, the course is divided into three parts: cultural criticism, media writing, and transmedia storytelling.The first section focuses on the function, language, and format of cultural criticism. The course introduces the core principles of writing critique on literature, films, popular culture, and visual art. Students are invited to discuss the works both aesthetically and critically. Another section of the course focuses on the fundamental skills specific to the media forms of print, digital platforms, and social media. Foregrounded with a comprehensive understanding of media infrastructures, students will be able to develop skills in collecting information, generating ideas, organizing the structure of their writing, and effectively presenting their thoughts.The final section draws on Henry Jenkins’s concept of “convergence.” We will compare the conventions of traditional narratives with the world of transmedia storytelling, including but not limited to the ‘converging’ realms of YouTube, podcasts, and interactive content on social media. Students will learn to develop storytelling skills while making good use of media platforms for content distribution.",

Students are required to have previously taken CURE2066 or possess a solid understanding of visual design principles, as well as basic proficiency in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere, along with some experience in beginner-level photography.The course is comprised of lectures, readings, workshops, and practical image projects. Compared to CURE2066, this course delves further into advanced techniques of using Adobe Premiere and combines them with foundational skills in Adobe After Effects to explore the process of creating various visual effects. Building upon the instructional foundation of conventional elements in video production, such as photography, recording, and lighting, this course also covers and practices multiple shooting methods, including mobile photography, sports photography, and drone photography. These various shooting approaches enable students to effectively convey their creative ideas through rich visual forms, helping them explore and develop their own visual expression style while preparing them for future employment opportunities.",

      "description": "The Union Version of the Bible (1919) constitutes an important factor in shaping modern Chinese literature and the vernacular movement in the early twentieth century. A large number of works of May Fourth writers (such as Lu Xun, Bing Xin and Xu Dishan) are filled with biblical images, themes, allusions and quotations. Meanwhile, many Chinese translations of the Bible are heavily influenced by the Chinese cultural and literary traditions. For instance, Yan Fu’s translation of the Gospel of Mark employs an elegant style of classical Chinese, while Wu Jingxiong’s Psalms adopts the refined forms of Shijing (The Book of Songs) and Chuci (The Songs of Chu). This course aims to examine the intricate interactions between Chinese literature and the Bible, particularly the influences of Chinese literary traditions on the translations of the Bible and the rhetorical influences of the Bible on the emergence of modern Chinese literature, with a view to widening students’ perspectives in the interdisciplinary study of literature and religion.",

      "description": "Chinese novels have long been intertwined with religion. While Confucian, Buddhist and Daoist thoughts permeate classical Chinese novels, a large number of modern Chinese novels are peppered with Christian elements. As a lively epitome of Chinese religious culture, these novels also promoted the spread of religious thoughts among the people. This course aims to investigate the interactive relationship between Chinese novels and religion. Students will be guided to examine the religious contents in novels and the ways in which religious thoughts shape the themes, narratives, characterization and language of the novels. Texts selected for reading include classical and modern novels, such as Strange Tales of Liaozhai, The Story of the Stone and The Journey to the West.",

There are two options for fieldwork which students can choose from. 1: Visiting various Hindu, Sikh and Jain temples in Hong Kong2: A 10 day visit to India that will include visiting both religious and historical sites.In both cases students will learn through first-hand exposure to religious relics, sites, material culture and personal interactions with Indian practitioners of different faiths. The sites of visit will be organized and led by experienced member(s) of the teaching staff. Sites to be visited in Hong Kong and India will include mainstream traditions within the broad framework of Hinduism, such as the Vaishnava Bhakti movement and the Shaiva tradition. Field work will also include visits to traditions that originally arose as challenges to mainstream Hinduism such as the Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs. There will be six lectures conducted on campus prior to the fieldwork that will offer students an overview of the geographical, philosophical and historical background of the sites that will be visited and the traditions we will interact with. Students who select option 1 will spend the rest of the term on fieldwork in Hong Kong. This will be planned together with the instructor. For students who select option 2 a ten day trip to India during the Christmas holidays will be arranged. Fieldwork should add up to approximately 21 hours of off campus learning which will include on-site lectures, on-the-spot investigations and tutorial discussions during the trip. Both a pre-trip and a post-trip assignment in the form of a reading report, essay and/or presentation are required. . It should be noted that enrolment for option 2 is limited to 25 persons with the course being conducted in English and Chinese. For more details regarding option 2 please contact the department.

The second part of the course uses case studies from Hong Kong to examine how certain sites or practices have been institutionalized and listed as local or international heritages. It also explores various models of defining and managing Hong Kong's cultural heritage. By the end of the course, students will be able to think beyond “Eurocentric” heritage concepts and practices, and be aware of the correlation between Hong Kong cultural heritage, identity, and community.",

The first session explains the birth of this set of contemporary art practices in relation to the Dadaist movement of the early twentieth century that opened up new concepts for visual arts. This will be followed by a session that discusses the range of media now commonly adopted in the discipline, including video, photography, computer graphics, webpage, and the Internet. Different set of techniques are involved in these productions, and they often generate quite different social impacts that affect both the producers and the users. Students are instructed to understand both the technological and social aspects of these areas. The last session comprises a series of workshops that lead students to appreciate and comment on the most featured productions. Emphasis is placed on the angle to promote this new art type as a rising cultural sector in the society.",

      "course_syllabus": "1. Art and Technology\n\nThe history of new media art began in the early 20th century. The well-read article by Walter Benjamin defines a new age in art distribution. This lecture discusses the adoption of technological devices in modern art production, as well as the impact factors of using technology that both contribute to and alter the original aims of traditional arts.\n\n2. How ‘new’ is the New Media?\n\nHow does ‘New Media’ differ from the old one? Why was it born? This lecture discusses the work by Dali and Duchamp, as well as their critiques. It looks at how the artists found interests in the new devices and how they employed so in expressing thoughts and feelings during the so-called Dadaist and Pop Movement.\n\n3. Virtual Effects and Visual Culture\n\nNew technologies gave visual culture a new life in the 20th century that opened up many different opportunities of making interaction through the use of prints, drawings, photographs, and videos. This lecture discusses the concepts of simulation and immersion in visual arts. It also introduces the concept of virtual reality, which has been widely applied in both two and three-dimensional work.\n\n4. Films and Animations\n\nThis lecture continues the last one in discussing the idea of realism and representation in media production. This one focuses on the images reproduced in films and video games. It discusses the theories employed in photography and filming with digital devices that lead students to think how the new technologies alter the traditional views about representation.\n\n5. Economy and the Web Media\n\nThe New Media is often regarded as being reasonably economical in operation, compared with other traditional means of presentation. This lecture discusses the economic aspects of using different web engines and forums, as well as the commercial limits in employing those devices.\n\n6. Wikis and Web 2.0\n\nWeb 2.0 is a concept introduced at the beginning of this century to describe the combination of software (HTML), hardware, and Internet in forming a major sector of social interaction. The Wikipedia introduced in 2004 gave every user a new participant identity in the virtual world. This lecture discusses how the boom of Internet information alter social practices and ideas.\n\n7. Games, Animation And the Cyber-world\n\nIn countries, such as Japan and Korea, games and animation form a major sector in the creative industries. This lecture introduces the Dreamweaver and Power Game Factory. It discusses the social impacts of those new entertaining devices in re-defining the issues of gender, ethnics, and even national identities.\n\n8. Workshop I: Installation and Contemporary Arts\n\nIn this workshop session, the instructor will lead students to look at the classic examples of installation in contemporary art display. The work by Damien Hurst, Cai Guoqiang, Xu Bing, and other contemporary artists will be discussed.\n\n9. Workshop II: Editing Techniques in Photography\n\nThis workshop leads students to practice photography and understand the central theories in shooting in relation to previous lecture on visual culture.\n\n10. Workshop III: Editing Techniques in Filming\n\nThis workshop teaches students the skills in editing and handling effects with Final Cut Pro and Snapz.\n\n11. Workshop III: Sound, music and noise\n\nThis workshop introduces the Sound Studio Pro, and leads students to acquire the skills in audio capture and sound recording.\n\n12. Workshop IV: Webpage, Internet and Heritage\n\nThis workshop reviews the use of web technology in preserving and reconstructing heritage and historical sites.\n\n13. Project presentation\n\n14. Conclusion: Can the New Media be Forever ‘New’?\n\nThis last lecture is a response to the question stated in the first lecture, and is the key question in the field of New Media Studies. This lecture discusses how the new media constructs an artificial identity in the expanded visual world based on technology.",

      "description": "Public art is considered as an important cultural asset of metropolitan cities, closely related to city images and development. Community art serves as a tool for community development, based on the understanding that expression, mastery and communication through the arts powerfully encode cultural values, thus bringing deeper meanings of experience, participation and involvement, sense of belonging to the general public and the community. This course aims to advance students’ understanding of public and community arts by embedding them in the theoretical discussions and critiques of cities and public spaces and practical experiences. It also imparts the knowledge and skills about managing public arts and actualizing community art programs, and discusses the way to support their development responding to the needs.",

Students are expected to understand public art commission and reception, to master basic principles of utilizing public art as an urban design strategy, and to apply varying approaches to facilitating community art development, for example, advancing community art education, utilizing the cultural planning approach to assess community based cultural resources and the place-event approach to creating a sense of community attachment.",
      "course_syllabus": "Part I. Understanding Public and Community Art\n1. General Introduction\nThis section begins with displaying a range of public and community art cases and presents an introduction to the course. Three issues are covered in this introductory lecture. First, this section provides the conceptual discussions of public space, public art, and their art forms to enable students to understand what public art space and public art is. Second, this section explores the role of artists in public art space and community development. Third, a historical picture of public art is unfolded, which traces its origin, displays its developing process, and takes a glimpse into its enshrined social values.\n\n2. Understanding Public Art Spaces\nHow should we understand public art spaces and the public nature of public art? This section embeds these issues into the understanding of a city; it then conveys the ideas that public spaces are socially produced and that city forms are imbued with ideologies. Public art stems from an urban setting and then grows through the urban regeneration movement, which comprises several issues, such as urban image, urban form and urban planning as well as their connections with public art space as a form of representational space. Furthermore, this section explores the public nature of public art by examining the process, by which artists derive value from individual creativity in the studios and immense it into the public space.\nTutorial: Discuss the alternative history of public art (Lacy, 1995, 25–28).\n\n3. Public Art: The Monument\nThe monument is an important theoretical perspective to conceptualize public art. This section explains what a “monument” is and investigates its role—whether statue, memorial, or public statue—in upholding a value-laden system of Western society. Issues under examination range from the connection between monument and national identity, the power and representation of public arts, the transformative understanding of public art as a monument, and the contradictions of public art.\nTutorial: Discuss the public nature of public art.\n\n4. Critical Issues of Public Art Spaces\nWho comprise the “audience” of public arts? What does “intention” mean and what is the “effectiveness” of public art? This section further discusses the theories on critical issues related to public art. This section begins with the discussions of the relevant terms and proceeds to various critical thoughts that challenge the value of public art and question its public nature. Students are expected to be able to analyze public art spaces and public art critically.\nTutorial: Develop critical thinking about public art spaces and public art.\n\n5. Public Arts and Community Cultural Development: Theoretical Underpinnings of Community Art\nThis section provides a synopsis of the histories and theoretical issues of community art. The origin of community art is traced to the discourse of William Morris’s call for social reintegration of artists and a revival of art in the 19th century. Theoretical issues include the “popular front” and class consciousness, civil rights and identity politics, as well as cultural democracy and exchange. In addition, this section discusses the definitions of community, the role of community art, and the core purposes of community development.\nTutorial: Discuss the question, “What makes art valuable?”\n\nPart II. Public Art Management\n6. Commission and Reception of Public Art\nBased on the public nature of art, this section analyzes the process of art making, which comprises the elements of audience, context, and meaning. The process includes the following: acquiring cultural approval, arriving in public sites and places, providing visiting experiences with the audience, and generating meanings. Cases of Seattle and New York are used for this study. With regard to art reception, it analyzes the issues of taste, the education of the audience, as well as the relationship of art to society and popular visual culture. In addition, this section also distinguishes performance culture from monumental public art.\nTutorial: Distinguish public art from community art.\n\n7. Public Art and Urban Design\nThis section presents an urban design approach to commissioning and making public art. It outlines the principles for creating a city image, which consists of five elements, and discusses their connections to public art. Various forms of public art in association with the urban setting and the mechanism of public art utilization as an urban design strategy are also discussed. Students are guided toward understanding the role of public arts in urban design guidelines. Moreover, we also discussed a set of design principles on the relationship between public art and various urban forms and spatial components, aimed at integrating public art into the urban setting as context and reference is discussed.\nTutorial: Conduct design software training.\nAssignment: Find a sample of public art (i.e., sculpture) using design principles to assess its location, site, and designs as well as to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. Write a paper based on the research and use the design software to illustrate the arguments.\n\n8. Government Policies for Public and Community Art Development\nThe relation between power and public and community art is a critical issue in public and community art management. This section discusses the governmental structure that funds and commissions public art, the infrastructure that underpins public art, and the governmental policies that support community art. The selection of commissions and projects is discussed, along with the process of seeking public and professional responses. International and the local Hong Kong contexts are examined to explore how government policies affect public and community art. In the local context, the role of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department in promoting public art in Hong Kong is adopted as a case study.\nTutorial: Conduct an in-class test.\n\n9. Public Art in Metropolitan Cities\nThis section analyzes the role of public art in metropolitan cities, especially in the spheres of public transport, public open spaces, and public health system. A number of cases are presented, including forms of public art in the New York Subway system, London Underground and Mass Transit Railway, and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Hong Kong. The issue of commissioning public arts is revisited in the public art in metropolitan context.\nTutorial: Discuss urban design and public art in Hong Kong.\n\nPart III. Community Art Management\n10. Developmental Needs of the Field\nHow can community art development be supported? What do communities need? This section specifies the scope of cultural policies and the policy climate that community artists and community cultural development require. Moreover, this section discusses the material support that community cultural organizations and artists need, including funding supports and internal infrastructure and exchange.\nTutorial: Discuss the cultural policies for public art in Hong Kong.\n\n11. From Theory to Practice I: Process to Develop Community Arts\nFrom theory to practice, this section offers students a general orientation, which serves as a road map to the community-based art process. Five conceptual territories to advance community-based art as well as requisite techniques to fulfill tasks are introduced in this section, which include the following: 1) contacting people in the community; 2) conducting research on the culture of the community and the people’s perception of their community; 3) taking actions to make art projects; 4) gaining feedbacks from the community; and 5) incorporating these art forms into community art education programs to pass on skills and sustain the impact. The program also includes strategies for planning and organizing community outreach and engagement programs as well as ways to enhance public awareness.\nTutorial: Discuss the process of applying theories in the creation of community art in order to practice and initiate the group project with the community.\n\n12. From Theory to Practice II: Key Issues in Community Art Development\nBased on the holistic picture of the steps to develop community arts, this section focuses on certain key and challenging issues in the process, specifically those on research methods and art making. The section introduces qualitative and quantitative research methods for the project of community art development, and students are expected to learn how to identify survey areas, design survey questionnaires, run group discussions, and map cultural mind-sets and assets. Another key issue is how to make arts and work with artists. An artist will be invited to be the guest speaker to give the lesson.\nTutorial: Develop a group project with the community.\n\n13. Review and discussions\nStudents will present their on-going group projects on community art development, and the professor then provides comments and feedbacks on their projects. Key points of this course will also be reviewed in this class.",

      "description": "“Curator” once referred to an expert in keeping collections and making exhibitions, but has been expanded to encompass a hybrid role in innovation and knowledge creation. Today, curators are active agents in social and cultural transformation, taking part in dynamic projects presented by museums, commercial galleries, non-profit art spaces, biennials, art fairs, and many disruptive platforms beyond the field of art that didn’t previously exist. Curators produce knowledge, engage their audience, spark innovation, and constantly challenge the role of “curator” beyond the confines of the status quo across varied institutional settings. This course aims to provide students with hands-on experience in exhibition curation and engages students in a broad spectrum of real-world experiences and professional networking opportunities, aiming to prepare students for future curatorial projects/jobs. It covers topics such as idea conceptualization, proposal writing, pitching, budgeting, contracting, publication, exhibition design, installation and exhibition maintenance. By co-curating an exhibition in a non-profit art space in Hong Kong, students will take part in the various stages of exhibition making. With a focus on exhibition experience, audience engagement, and sociability, this course will train students in the role of being a curator and enable students to develop leadership skills and critically apply knowledge conducive to creative outcomes.",

      "description": "The concept of “creative industry” was proposed by the Labor Party in the U.K. in 1997. It refers to the activities that are embedded in individuals’ creativities, talents and skills, which have the potential for employment opportunities and economic growth through the exploitation of intellectual properties. Creative industry has become a key area in contemporary cultural policies. This course introduces students to the basic knowledge of managing entrepreneurship, which is a key issue in the creative industries. It comprises three parts. The first part provides a general introduction. The second part discusses the nature of entrepreneurship in creative industries and demonstrates the entrepreneurial process, through which, creative ideas are generated, cultural diffusion is stimulated and innovation processes are carried out. It informs students of the key traits of the creative entrepreneurs and the business opportunities and models for entrepreneurship processes in the creative industries. In the third part, it explores the conducive policy conditions to support and encourage entrepreneurship in creative industries.",

      "course_syllabus": "Part 1: General Introduction\n\nLecture 1: Creative industries and entrepreneurship: A brief introduction\nThe first lecture in this course will brief the concept of “creative industry” and introduce the key issues of creative industries (e.g., its developmental path, the main traits and its importance to economic growth). Entrepreneurship is a concept key to creative industry development: the creation of new business ventures and the conditions that define corporate venturing will be discussed.\nReadings:\nCCPR, 2003, 13-26;\nHarley et. al., 2013, 58-61\n\nLecture 2: Key issues for stakeholders in the creative industries: A global perspective\nThe development of the creative economy is widely concerned by policymakers, regional and local government and the business community. This section will explore how stakeholders face these issues in creative industries. It will also introduce creative industry development and entrepreneurship in Asia.\nReadings:\nGhosh and Malloy, 2011, 12-15;\nHui, 2007, 9-29\n\nPart 2: The Entrepreneurial Process\n\nLecture 3: Cultural diffusion in creative industries\nEntrepreneurs always face the challenge of transforming their good ideas into entrepreneurial practices. This section will exemplify this process using cases in different creative sectors in Hong Kong. It will explore the issue of “cultural diffusion” in the creative economy, a process, in which, creativity is produced and disseminated among the audience. The affecting factors (e.g., identity, creative product, business process and technology) will be looked into.\nReadings:\nDesai, 2011, 109-130;\nWolf, 1999, 45-61\n\nLecture 4: Innovation processes\nInnovation is not equal entrepreneurship, but it could be critical to successful entrepreneurship. This section discusses the scope of innovation, which transforms technical ideas and knowledge into new products or services or production processes. It uses examples of opera concert and film industry to demonstrate the process of innovation.\nReadings:\nVickery, 1997, 177-179;\nDavis and Scase, 2000, 1-22;\nHetcher, 2011, 70-80\n\nLecture 5: Entrepreneurship features of creative entrepreneurs\nWhat are the characteristics of creative entrepreneurs? To be successful in creative entrepreneurship, you need to know yourself first. Creative entrepreneurs display the traits different from managers in traditional industrial sectors; they represent the new knowledge workers with creative minds and risk taking spirits. Creative entrepreneurs need to remove the barriers of artistic, economic and marketing considerations. Cases from music industry and film industry will be used to illustrate the issues.\nReadings:\nMalloy, 2011, 15-18;\nGlick, 2008, 73-80\n\nLecture 6: Exploring business opportunities and models for entrepreneurship\nCreative products are delivered on two levels: artists and creative entrepreneurs on the one level; and the state and state entrepreneurship on the other level. This section explores how artists and entrepreneurs are fused, and examines business models for entrepreneurship in media and design industries.\nReadings:\nBruin, 2007, 87-106;\nHarris and Wegg-Prosser, 2009, 229-248\n\nLecture 7: Guest lecture: The experience from the industries\nOne or two guest speakers will be invited from the creative industries to share with the students their entrepreneurial experiences. Students are urged to ask questions and observe the qualities and characteristics of these creative entrepreneurs.\n\nPart 3: Supporting Entrepreneurship in Creative Industry Sectors\n\nLecture 8: Investment and funding for creative enterprises\nThis section explores the mechanisms and barriers to creative industries investment. It will also discuss the role of the public sector and the opportunities for problem solving. Partnership, commitment, specialism and genericism are the components that constitute the landscape of investment. This section illustrates the policy context and elaborates the value chain of creative industries investment. A set of tips are provided at the end.\nReadings:\nPowell, 2010, 175-184;\nFleming, 2007, 107-126\n\nLecture 9: The synergies of higher education, enterprise and innovation\nUniversities link creativity to intellectual property and business opportunities. Knowledge spills over from education and R&D programmes at universities and supports creative entrepreneurship in the surrounding community. This section looks at the developing role of universities in the creative industries. It explores various learning and entrepreneurial models for technological innovation and business engagement at universities.\nReadings:\nBrooks, 1997, 109-129;\nStefik and Stefik, 2010, 17-26\n\nLecture 10: Human language technologies in the creative industries\nTwo main technologies in the creative industries, i.e., information and communication technology (ICT) and human language technologies (HLT), are introduced. The key knowledge regards how these language technologies foster entrepreneurship in creative industries. Their practical implications to the creative industries in Hong Kong will be discussed.\nReadings:\nUNTAD, 2010;\nMitchell, 2016, 4-15\n\nLecture 11: Incubating entrepreneurship in creative industry clusters\nApart from funding investment, legal protection, technological support and university education, creative industry parks serve as incubators for entrepreneurship in the creative industries. An umbrella concept to be discussed in this section is the “creative milieu,” which is often exemplified by “creative industry parks.” Their characteristics and the central management of the parks in supporting entrepreneurship will be examined.\nReadings:\nCCPR, 2003, 75-184;\nMommaas, 2004, 507-532;\nMaskell, 2000, 1-6;\nScott, 1997, 73-80\n\nFieldtrip: Visiting creative policy makers\nA fieldtrip will be organized to expose students to the government officials at the Innovation and Technology Bureau. It will help them to understand Hong Kong creative industry policies and the intellectual property law.\n\nLecture 13: Course summary\nIn the last section, students will deliver their group presentations for feedback and discussion. An overview of the key knowledge in this course will be provided and practical implications will be discussed.",

      "description": "Cultural heritage is a dynamic and evolving concept that encompasses various interpretations rather than being a fixed notion. It includes a wide range of perspectives, from Eurocentric to post-colonial, with an increasing focus on living culture that intertwines global and local narratives. This field involves diverse interpretive lenses, public discourse, human rights issues, and a shift from mere observation to immersive experiences. The interpretations of cultural heritage are shaped by numerous stakeholders, including educators, public program participants, researchers, writers, designers, creatives, consultants, curators, scientists, and historians. In recent years, technological advancements have further enhanced the use of digital media and social networking in cultural heritage, fostering new connections between visitors and heritage. Consequently, the interpretation of cultural heritage remains dynamic and fluid, embracing a variety of approaches and philosophies.This course aims to provide students with a broad knowledge of cultural heritage interpretations and the theoretical frameworks that offer different lenses and approaches for thinking about cultural heritage. It covers various types of cultural heritage, the role of storytelling in heritage interpretation, heritage as public discourse, identity issues, visitor engagement and education, tourism, community involvement, and ethical issues. Additionally, this course will examine how technology plays a role in engaging audiences and facilitating interpretations. By offering students diverse concepts of cultural heritage interpretations, they will gain a comprehensive understanding of current interpretive approaches, emerging trends, and innovations in the interpretation of heritage.",

      "course_syllabus": "1 Introduction:What is a museum?\nThe introduction gives an overview of the museum structure and definition. This will introduce the various types of museums established around the world, defined according to the range of their collections. This will also compare the organization structure of a museum, in which the curatorial teams are working with a range of specialists relevant.\n\n2 The history of museums\nThe ‘history’ of museum sounds alien to the context of museum studies. But museum workers are coming to beware that the museums are products of modernity that marked a distinctive times in which antiquities could be treated as shared, public properties. This lecture reviews the establishments of the Louvre and the British Museum in the 18th century; and discusses how ‘museums’ were contextualized first in Japan and later on in China.\n\n3 Curatorship I: Exhibiting Authenticity and Interpretation\nAs the last lecture recalls, ‘Museum as Ritual’ has become an established social understanding—museum is a place where esteemed objects are being exhibited and therefore recognized. The first problem that encounters all museum works is whether the objects they are showing, or the theme of the objects that they are presenting are ‘authentic’. In this lecture, we will look at examples of some early colonial museums and study the created themes that they presented.\n\n4 Curatorship II: Organizing a thematic exhibition\nPutting up a thematic exhibition (alongside the permanent exhibition) is a common practice in most museums. This lecture will give instructions as to what elements a thematic show should include. Then students are organized into groups to do a role play session for three parties: museum workers, overseas collaborators, and the donors. From this exercise, students will learn about the difficulties in negotiations and planning.\n\n5 Curatorship III: Museum publications and cultural writings\nThe writings published for the museums share a common theme of identifying the artistic or historical values of the objects. In practice, however, there are various levels in addressing objects through literary practices. This lecture will look into some representative examples written for different targeted groups, which include children, pupils, and foreign visitors.\n\n6 Museum and society I: Architecture and Design\nRenovation projects were undertaken in numerous renowned museums around the world, because it has become aware that museums have to catch up with young generations and with the rapidly developed cities, in which they are located. This lecture will look into the case of Doha Quarter, where the locals took a deliberate attempt to a museum compound. From such we will consider the significance of architecture and museum collection.\n\n7 Museum and society II: Education and Application of Digital Technology\nSmartphones and other technological devices have become useful sources for museum presentations and visits. This lecture reviews some applications both within the museum building and outside it. The lecture will also respond to the concerns that digital technologies may exhaust public interests in the museum collections. With these both sides of argument, this lecture leads students to consider both the usefulness and shortcomings of digital technologies.\n\n8 Museum and society III: Patrons, Donors and Volunteers, the sources of Funding and Support\nFunding is always limited for cultural institutions. In this lecture, we will discuss the various potential fund sources for the museums. There is no standard way in the industry as to what the museum workers should do or write to apply for funding. But there are recognized sources about which they could get in touch: public visitors, membership programmes, volunteers, donars, and governmental resources. The key of the lecture is to develop an open mind to expand the coverage of funding from monetary values to public recognition.\n\n9 Current issue I: Museum Branding and Marketing\nMuseum branding has been identified as a major marketing strategy for cultural institution. In this lecture, we will look at the suggestions of some successful museum workers and study their marketing approaches by creating a brand for museums.\n\n10 Current issue II: Soft Power and the Political Roles of Museums.\nAs soon as Joseph Nye published his idea about soft power, which is based on the dissemination of cultural products or ideas, the discussion is always concerned with museum exhibitions. Museums could be taken as political statement of national treasures. In this lecture, we will discuss the ideas of Nye and look at how such concept has been interpreted in Asia.\n\n11 Fieldtrip/site visit week\nThis week we will take some fresh air by visiting a local museum/site.\n\n12 Current issue III: Museums and Contemporary Arts.\nShould we include contemporary art in the context of museum? This is a difficult question that happens to most museums around the world. The well-used resolution is construction of a new venue dedicated to contemporary arts. The differences between the two disciplines—museums and contemporary arts—are related to the level of curatorship and public recognition. But the two themes seem to have blurred since the last decade.\n\n13 Current issue IV: M+ and other museums in Hong Kong\nIn this last session, we will return our discussion to Hong Kong and look at what options this city has in comparison from what we have seen in other parts of the world. The M+ is dedicated to contemporary arts, or experimental arts; but the local museums remain fairly traditional in terms of collection and their range of exhibitions. Can Hong Kong develop a cultural hub? If so, what roles do these institutes would play?",

      "description": "Departing from the dominant canon of critical theory, this course aims to introduce students to a wider, more diverse range of theoretical texts and frameworks by marginalized voices and from peripheral locations.This course seeks to decolonize theory by multiplying the sites of intellectual and critical inquiry. Instead of treating Benjamin, Adorno, Hall, and Grossberg as representative of the corpus of theory, it engages with prevailing discussions in Postcolonial Studies, Modernity/Coloniality, and Black Studies. It moves beyond the call for ‘de-Westernization’ by looking at theoretical texts and frameworks produced in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The course concludes by exploring work about indigeneity, memory, and environmentalism. The course is designed for advanced undergraduates with familiarity in critical approaches to literature, cinema, art, and media. Classes will grapple with the following questions: What qualifies as theory? Is theory necessarily abstract? What is the relationship of theory to particularity and difference? How can theory be made more attune to its contexts of production, dissemination, and application? How can film and visual art offer sources for theorizing? How might theoretical frameworks respond more significantly to social, economic, and environmental conditions from the restructuring of the capitalist system, expansion of media networks, dissolution of national borders, and deterioration of the climate crisis?",

      "terms": [],
      "description": "The course will offer an introduction to critical views on pornography, which is defined as sexually explicit media within different cinematic traditions and digital screen cultures. The aim of the course is to show that pornography is a not a unified screen culture but consists of varied representations within cultural contexts. The course will teach students how to analyze these representations and how to take into account their cultural histories. The course will take a Cultural Studies approach and examine within specific cultural environments and include the positions of anti-porn and pro-porn activists. Therefore students will get an overview of diverging perspectives while being encouraged to consider their own values and critical responses. Students will be asked to respond to theories and audio-visual examples, while actively partaking in debates about pornography and its impact on religion, gender, sexuality, health, labor and economy. Finally, the course will pay special importance to how contemporary sexually explicit media are impacting new user groups such young adult netizens, female consumers, disabled people, as well as ethnic and sexual minorities. Students will carry out a major assignment while learning how to apply ethnographic research methods to analyze representations of the body and sexuality within screen cultures. In this assignment, they will focus on a media environment/platform and a sexual culture of their choice to find out how culture is being redefined and visualized by media users. Two workshops will be organized in the media lab in order to train the students in different methods and perspectives on digital ethnographyLanguage of instruction: Classes and assignments will be carried out in the English language and students’ active participation in both lectures and tutorials will be required. Students can carry out ethnographic fieldwork in Cantonese or any language of your choice, but need to present the results in English.Learning Activities: Students are required to attend a 3-hour class each week. The course combines theoretical lectures with the viewing of films and media examples. There will also be tutorial sessions each week based on the lectures and on the weekly readings. All students are required to post weekly reflections on Blackboard and to participate in discussions. In addition to the weekly readings and reflections, students will conduct research and planning for their assessments and oral presentations independently and in groups.Please be advised that this course will involve some screenings and discussions of sexually explicit materials and category III films. Therefore, students under 18 years-old are advised not to take this course.",

This course includes lectures, projects, and critical discussions. At the end of the course, students will be able to critically evaluate the inevitable integration of AI in creative workflows and its implications for the future of art, and articulate the critical issues and ethical implications of AI on creative arts.",

      "course_syllabus": "1. **What was AI? (Week 1 - 2)**\n\n* *Readings: Norbert Wiener, “Man, Machine, and the World About” (1950)**\n\n* *Screenings: Werner Herzog, *Lo and Behold: Reverie of Connected World.***\n\n2. **What is AI, now? (Week 3)**\n\n* *Readings:** excerpts from **Michael Woodridge, *A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence.***\n\n* *Tutorial reading:** **excerpts from Lev Manovich,** ***The Language of New Media***\n\n3. **What is Gen AI? (Week 4 - 6)**\n\n* *The big deal about text-generation (week 4-5)**: Text generation depends on the development of Large Language Models. LLMs, like OpenAI's GPT-4, are trained on vast datasets, enabling them to understand and generate human-like text with remarkable accuracy and fluency.\n\n* *Readings: Ted Chiang, “ChatGPT Is a Blurry Image of the Net,” *New Yorker***\n\nExcerpts from **Naomi Baron, *Who Wrote This? How AI and the Lure of Efficiency Threaten Human Writing.***\n\n* *The big deal about image- and video-generation (week 5-6)**: Research indicates that tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E boast efficiency of generating digital artworks. The use of AI in film production is growing, with advancements in generative models for video creation. For instance, Runway's Gen-2 model produces high-quality, short video clips that are nearing professional animation standards. Major studios like Paramount and Disney are exploring AI for tasks such as lip-syncing and special effects, demonstrating the technology's potential to revolutionize filmmaking​ ([MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/04/1086046/whats-next-for-ai-in-2024/))​.\n\nReadings: \"Generative artificial intelligence, human creativity, and art\" - PNAS Nexus​ ([Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/3/pgae052/7618478))​\n\n4. **Computer Vision (week 7)**\n\nComputer vision is not as computer-driven as one might think. It depends on huge amount of human labor for object recognition to work.\n\nReadings: excerpts from Jason Dalton, *The Birth of Computer Vision*.\n\n5. **Guest lecture (week 8):** 3D modelling and animation.\n\nReadings: to be announced.\n\n6. **Glitch (week 9)**\n\nGlitch art, an emergent genre within media studies and digital art, embraces the aesthetic and conceptual potential of glitches—unexpected malfunctions or errors in digital technology. Scholars and artists view glitches not as mere technical failures but as opportunities for creative expression and critical reflection. The practice of glitch art can be seen as part of a broader tradition of avant-garde and experimental art that includes Dada, Surrealism, and Abstract Expressionism. It is also linked to the creation of new identities.\n\nReadings: excerpts from Legacy Russell, *Glitch Feminism*\n\n7. **AI Art Exhibitions** **(week 10)**\n\nPrograms like Google's Artists + Machine Intelligence (AMI) support the intersection of art and machine learning by providing funding and mentorship to artists. These initiatives aim to sustain a diverse field of creative practitioners working with AI, fostering innovative projects and collaborations that push the boundaries of traditional art forms​ ([Artists + Machine Intelligence](https://ami.withgoogle.com/))​.\n\nFinal project consultation\n\n8. **Dangers of AI (week 11-13)**:\n\n* *Cultural Politics (week 11):** How generative AI perpetuate bias, spread misinformation, and cultivate overreliance on AI.\n\nReadings: Bender, E.M., Gebru, T., McMillan-Major, A., Shmitchell, S. “On the dangers of stochastic parrots: Can language models be too big?,” *FAcct 2021.*\n\n* *Copyright (week 12)**: Legal disputes and debates about AI's role in creative industries highlight the need for careful consideration of intellectual property rights and the unique value of human artistic expression​ ([Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/3/pgae052/7618478))​​ ([Phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2024-03-ai-art-human-creativity.html))​.\n\n* *Readings:***everything* you can find on the law suit on OpenAI by *The New York Times*\n\n* *Environmental concerns (week 13):** **Energy consumption, mineral mining, the global GPU supply chain and its waste have all significant and largely unseen environmental impact.**",

      "description": "This course is continuation of CUMT1001, Introduction to Cultural Management, and looks at cultural management from the macro perspective. Successful culture managers work to maintain healthy balance between culture and its relevant fields of interests, which sometimes could turn harmful or beneficial to the growth and development of the corresponding cultural area. The first session discusses the mutual dependence between culture and various areas, which include laws, economy, community, national interests, and art practitioners. In practice, cultural managers usually have to conform to the values and ethnics of the corresponding countries. For that reason, the second session will look at the approach taken in a few remarkable examples, which Taiwan, China, Singapore, South Korea, U.K., and the U.S.",

      "course_syllabus": "Section I: Culture in Context\n\n1. Culture & States\nThe growth of cultural industries is strongly related to political environment and state policy. This lecture discusses the tension and mutual expectations between cultural workers and politicians. It will use the experience of the European Union and the US as examples.\n\n2. Culture & Laws\nOver the last few decades, there were a number of remarkable disputes over international art transactions and copy rights. Given the growing size of the art market, knowledge about the previous cases is essential. This lecture takes the examples taken from the US for discussions.\n\n3. Culture & UNESCO\nUNESCO is arguably a rising new power in forming a standard for evaluating cultural heritage of different nations. This lecture discusses the roles of UNESCO and its work in different cultural disciplines. National disputes over ownership of World Heritage sites will be bought up.\n\n4. Culture & Community\nNowadays many nations and countries perceive culture and heritage as means to empower developing communities. This lecture discusses the conservation of indigenous or minorities cultures, and its impacts on the majority population of the same community.\n\n5. Culture & Marketing\nCulture and business are often taken as two contrasting disciplines. One of the key issues in cultural management is to develop cultural audience with both education and economic concerns. Religious sectors are a growing body of cultural venues for tourism and heritage management. This lecture discusses the debated concerns about conducting marketing or business-driven strategies in cultural and religious areas.\n\nSection II: Case Studies\n6. Cultural Management in Taiwan\nTaiwan provides an excellent example to demonstrate the top-down organization of heritage sites. This lecture reviews a series of campaigns launched in Taiwan during the past twenty years, and discusses the reasons that may have contributed to engage the mass of Taiwan into different aspects of cultural industries.\n\n7. Cultural Management in China\nChina represents many upcoming opportunities in cultural management. This lecture reviews some recent moves: rapid establishment of museums, growing number of commercial galleries and auction houses, rise of new Confucian schools, introduction of university degrees in cultural management, etc. The lecture discusses the consuming force underneath the cultural growth in the Mainland.\n\n8. Cultural Management in Singapore\nDuring the last two decades, the government of Singapore invested heavily on constructing cultural venues for both national and economic purposes. This lecture gives an overview of their establishment and invites students to reflect on the opportunities found in other areas of Asia.\n\n9. Cultural Management in South Korea\nThis lecture discusses the contemporary cultural policies undertaken in South Korea. During the last decade, South Korea featured an economic miracle in Asia by rejuvenating the distressed financial market with cultural developments, which included the film industry, heritage protection, publication, and cultural tourism.\n\n10. Cultural Management in UK\nThe United Kingdom was one of the earliest countries that invested heavily on promotion of cultural and arts events. This lecture gives a short history of the early developments made in the UK after the Second World War, and discusses the recent campaigns undertaken to break the boundaries between high arts and popular culture.\n\n11. Cultural Management in USA\nThe United States distinguishes herself from all other countries by boosting the absence of a ministry for arts and culture, yet artists and cultural workers receive due respects for their contributions. This lecture looks at the case of the US and examines her success in cultural management.\n\n12. Group presentation\nThis lecture is taken as a mock symposium for students to present their group projects and make comments on those by their peers. The presentation will be evaluated against the clarity and thoughts over the approved topics.\n\n13. Conclusion: What is the best for Hong Kong?\nThis last session will summarize the topics covered throughout the course. Hong Kong is facing the challenge that many aspects of cultural developments in relation to urban planning, legislation, economy, national identity, and education are all pending. This lecture is an open discussion for students to brainstorm the possible approaches that Hong Kong could take in years to come.",

It comprises three blocks: Block 1 unfolds an overall picture of the phenomenon, introduces the related concepts, displays the disciplinary foundation of this topic, traces its history, and discusses the rationales and developing tendency. Block 2 studies the urban sociological and economic approaches employed in developing the theoretical foundation, highlighting a transition in capitalist production mode and urban governance upheld by public-private partnership modes. Criticisms are also presented to complete a dialectic mindset of this phenomenon. With a strong practical dimension, Block 3 teaches students various methods to make consultancy and policy recommendations for culture-led urban development projects. A variety of practices that constitute the culture-led strategy are discussed, such as how to plan for a creative city and cultural facilities, how to boost creative industries and develop cultural quarters and creative clusters, as well as how to revitalize historic quarters.",

Then, they can gain a deep theoretical understanding of the origins of these practices in a capitalist political economic transition, the corresponding urban policies, and the urban governance modes. Moreover, students can learn how to conduct policy analysis and apply urban planning and design principles to provide consultancy for culture-led city development projects. The final products of group projects shall consist of policy recommendations and project consultancies for the Hong Kong government or other private sector developers.",
      "course_syllabus": "Part 1: Introduction to the Culture-led City Development Phenomenon\n1. Culture-led City Development: A Topic of Popularity\nWith a glimpse into a number of cities in Europe, America, and Asia that have implemented culture-led urban regeneration strategies, this lecture aims to spark the students’ initial interest in this global phenomenon. This lecture identifies the disciplinary foundations of the topic—from cultural studies, economic geography, and urban sociology to urban planning and design. Furthermore, this lecture examines the concept of culture in the culture-led city development phenomenon, emphasizing the increasing importance of culture in the related disciplines in the mindset of “culture determining.” The role of culture in generating profits, jobs, and other economic returns, being interwoven with local governance and identity is discussed.\n\n2. Concepts, History, Rationale, and Debate\nThis section introduces a set of concepts closely related to that of “culture-led city development,” such as “cities of culture,” “property-led development” and “culture-led regeneration,” and differentiates the nuances among these concepts. The theories that argue for the role of culture in city formation and urban development are discussed, in which culture is viewed as resource or capital leading to symbolic economy that valorizes cities. A related issue is the role of cultural planning, which offers the resources and the framework in the process. The other theoretical source under scrutiny in this section is the importance of city or an urban environment to the growth of culture and cultural consumption. The writings of Jane Jacobs, Sharon Zukin, and Grame Evans are introduced.\nTutorial: Discuss selected readings.\n\nPart 2: Urban Sociological and Economic Approach to Understanding Culture-led Urban Regeneration\n3. Politics, Cultural Policies, and Culture-led City Development Strategies\nThis section explores the theoretical foundation of the culture-led city development phenomenon within the context of political economy. The transition of the capitalist production mode from Fordist economy to market-led post-Fordist economy has led to corresponding transitions in urban policies and urban governance modes, as well as to the adoption of public-private partnership. Culture-led city development strategy is a strategy, which is in line with the entrepreneurial urban policies. In addition, this section examines the connection between the culture-led city development strategies and the transformed cultural policies in cities. The broadening of the policy focus from art amenity provision to cultural economy development and urban cultural spaces planning has been identified as the most important policy context. Three stages of culture-led urban regeneration in terms of policies are also explained in detail.\nTutorial: Discuss selected readings.\n\n4. Economy of Culture and Arts in Cities\nThis section discusses the economic importance of culture and arts in cities. Culture is viewed as a new driver in urban economic growth, and the cultural sector is viewed as an indicator of urban economic growth. The economic importance of culture is associated with the so-called “symbolic economy” in cities, which involves upgrading urban images and boosting cultural consumption (e.g., urban tourism) within specific urban economies. Cultural and creative industries are the other main focal points of this lecture; thus, the geographic dimensions of cultural and creative industries are explored in this section. Furthermore, this lecture elaborates on the characteristics of cultural industry businesses and organizations, the geographic distribution of networks, and their production and consumption modes. Finally, a method to measure cultural and creative industries in cities is introduced.\nTutorial: Discuss selected readings.\n\n5. Culture-led Urban Regeneration Regimes and Cultural Strategies\nBianchini divides cultural culture-led city development strategies into culture-production-led and culture-consumption-led regeneration approaches. This section explores four types of production-led regeneration regimes and the consumption-led regime mode; cultural strategies and their interactions with modes of cultural production are also discussed. In addition, this section addresses the question of whether cultural strategies affect the conditions of cultural production. Finally, a method to fund cultural strategies is studied.\nTutorial: Discuss selected readings.\n\n6. Urban Governance and Partnership Modes in Culture-led City Development\nWhat are the urban governance modes that match individual culture-led city development practices? The transformation of urban governance and partnership modes, which is a response to the change in the capitalist production mode, is an important issue in understanding of culture-led urban development practices. Partnership is not simply a transition from managerial to entrepreneurial form but a public sector-led management to local public-private partnership to manage their opportunities effectively in the global economic background. This section explores the characteristics of urban governance and public-private partnership. This knowledge can be applied in creating cultural quarters, CCJQs, and cultural facilities in Block 3.\nTutorial: Discuss selected readings.\n\n7. Critiques on Culture-led Urban Regeneration\nCulture-led urban development strategies result in positive urban outcomes; however, they can also have negative impacts. This section presents the criticisms against culture-led urban development. For example, designation and zoning of cultural quarters often lead to the gentrification effect that cuts off poor artists from industrial studios. Flagship cultural facilities have a high chance of failure, often resulting in social exclusion and economic inequality and trigger tensions between cultural diversity and cultural hegemony. Moreover, the contribution of cultural projects to employment and GDP is questioned.\nTutorial: Discuss selected readings.\n\nPart 3: Strategies and Mechanisms for Practice: Policies, Urban Planning, and Design Tools\n8. Cultural Planning and Creative Cities\nThis section introduces the concept of “cultural planning” as well as its goals, principles, and rationale for practice. The major steps for practice are discussed briefly. The second issue in this lecture is related to creative city and creative milieu. Based on the concept of “creative city” introduced in CUMT1001, this lecture discusses the principles and methods to create a creative milieu for a city. Further discussions are based on the insights of Landry regarding the components of creative cities and Hall about the characteristics and preconditions for the creation of creative cities.\nMid-term Test\n\n9. Boosting Cultural and Creative Industries in Cities\nThis section discusses a method of using policy and planning tools to boost cultural and creative industries in cosmopolitan cities. First, the three stages of cultural industry development in connection with cultural policy transformations in history are reviewed. Second, a method is introduced, by which policies for cultural and creative industry development can be designed and initiated. Sophisticated analyses of local resources of arts, cultural industries and their interconnections, along with production chain linkage and planning assessment, comprise the key steps in creating effective policy designs. The geographic convergence of cultural businesses and creative industry undertakings in the form of clustering has been argued to be a possible mechanism to facilitate the growth of cultural and creative industries. Finally, the principles and methods to generate CCJQs using policy and planning methods are outlined in this section.\nTutorial: Draft a proposal aimed at transforming Hong Kong into a creative city.\n\n10. Planning for Public Arts, Arts Amenities, and Cultural Facilities\nDeveloping cultural facilities through urban planning and design is an integral part of culture-led urban development. This section examines the position of arts amenities in urban policies through various historical stages, as well as the transition from emphasizing arts amenity provision to cultural facilities in urban planning. The main content of this lecture is devoted to providing instruction with regard to the ways by which to plan for cultural facilities in cosmopolitan cities, with an outline of the main approaches, such as providing cultural facilities as per the related planning codes with complementary methods of survey, designing a hierarchical system of cultural facility provision, developing facilities of mixed-use, and engaging member of the community. The anti-planning approach to creating cultural spaces is also included, the core concern of which involves a flexibly use of public and community spaces and family-centered virtual media facilities.\nTutorial: Analyze the policies of Hong Kong’s cultural and creative industries, and draft policy recommendations for creative industry development in Hong Kong.\n\n11. Creating Cultural Quarters\nCultural quarters, rooted in post-Fordist economy, have become an integral part of urban regeneration regime, which represents a transition in urban cultural policies toward a more comprehensive stage. This section discusses the political and economic importance of cultural quarters, the rationale of clustering cultural activities and creative industry businesses, and the typology of cultural quarters. Students are also introduced to the strategies and principles for creating cultural quarters based on Roodhouse’s writings in 2006. Urban design skills to enhance the robustness of buildings and create vibrant street spaces and pedestrian spaces are complemented to Roodhouse’s principles. Possible solutions to control gentrification are also discussed using the case of Lace Market. The final part of this section presents the instructor’s consultancy project for the West Kowloon Cultural District.\nTutorial: Come up with recommendations for improving cultural facilities in Hong Kong.\n\n12. Heritage Conservation and Historic Urban Quarter Revitalization\nThe significance of historical buildings and urban heritage sites in making a creative urban creative milieu and the process of disseminating symbols through cultural consumption-led urban spaces have been covered by previous sections. In this section, students are introduced to the historical transition and developing tendency of historic buildings and heritage conservation from preserving individual buildings to area-based conservation. With a clarification of the meaning of historic quarters, this section focuses on the selection of appropriate approaches or strategies that can be used in revitalizing historic urban quarters. These methods include preservation and conservation controls as well as physical and economic revitalization based on the assessment of the type of obsoletion.\nTutorial: Consultancy report for a cultural district in Hong Kong\n\n13. The Workshop: Making Culturally Reenergized Cities\nIn this section, the final group is expected to present their group project on historical quarter revitalization in Hong Kong. To wrap up this course, the final section summarizes all the key issues and points. Supplemental instructions are provided based on the progress of the students’ group projects, after which all comments on each group’s projects are synthesized. One or two mechanisms might be introduced to strengthen the students’ capacity to apply the theories learned, such as the evaluation matrix for cultural quarters and historic building reuses. A Q&A section is then included to answer students’ questions concerning the knowledge in this course. Moreover, additional supervision for individual group projects is provided as needed.",

      "description": "Cultural heritage is not confined to the past but is continuously carried forward into the present and future through various modern applications. These applications address current societal concerns, needs, and the ever-changing culture both locally and globally. The relevance of cultural heritage is influenced by complex power structures, including its presentation and representation in contexts such as postcolonialism, racial dynamics, gender, intergenerational equity, disparities in access to technology, marginalization, and the tension between localism and globalization. Additionally, the modern application of cultural heritage is shaped by evolving economic structures and technological advancements. Heritage is increasingly utilized by creative industries, with its assets digitized, interpreted, and experienced through advanced technologies such as AI and VR. Ensuring the continued relevance of cultural heritage has become a critical issue.This course aims to provide students with an understanding of cultural heritage and its diverse modern applications, along with the critical concepts that shape our perception of its relevance today. It addresses issues concerning cultural heritage and its relationship with changing urban demographics, climate change, intergenerational equity, and the application of technologies for future alternatives. Additionally, the course explores cultural heritage as an economic generator, its role in performance, sports, and games, and its adoption in personalized tours and emerging cultural industries. Through a variety of concepts and case studies, students will gain multiple perspectives on current practices and reflect on the vast potential of cultural heritage in contemporary times.",

      "description": "This course picks up topics, which cannot be fully covered in CUMT4007 Museum Studies, but are essential for students pursuing careers in the area of museum and exhibition planning. This course is an advanced version, because it will touch on debated issues regarding museums. It focuses on installation, display, and site management. The purposes of the course may be summarized as follows: 1. What are the various display methods in museums? What are the concerns involved in selecting the ‘right’ ones? 2. How are museum workers (non-curatorial) trained? 3. What are the essential facilities a museum is expected to have? Why? 4. What is the role of museum in the contemporary arts, which is the area of debate regarding its significance and curatorship? The course develops students’ awareness towards global developments in world-class museums, so that they are equipped with skills and knowledge necessary for long-term competition in museums or other cultural institutions.",

      "course_syllabus": "1. Introduction: the Unseen Impacts of Museums\n\nMuseums make impacts in our societies in many ways, but they are usually gone unnoticed, almost unseen. What are the popular ways taken to measure the impacts of museums? And how useful (and meaningful) are they?\n\nReadings:\n\na. Paulus, Odile. \"Measuring Museum Performance: A Study of Museums in France and the United States.\" International Journal of Arts Management 6, no. 1 (October 1, 2003): 50-63.\n\nb. Jacobsen, John W. Measuring museum impact and performance theory and practice (Chapters 2&3). Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2016.\n\nPART I Display and Installation\n\n2. Oral Histories I\n\nNot everything in the museum is tangible. In many cases, the objects are reminders of something unheard, unseen, or even almost forgotten. Oral histories are a common way to preserve the dying records. This lecture introduces the practice of building oral history records, and get students to develop their set of questions to preserve extinguishing cultural practices or knowledge.\n\nReading:\n\na.

Chew, R. \"Collected stories - The rise of oral history in museum exhibitions.\" Museum News 81, no. 6 (Nov. & dec. 2002): 30-37.\n\n3. Oral Histories II\n\nWith audio and written records readily made, how do we put them in the museum setting? This lecture discusses various possibilities and gets students to develop the rationale of their selections through debates and discussions.\n\nReading:\n\na. Jones, Sian. \"Oral History and Museum Education.\" Oral History 12, no. 2 (October 1, 1984): 68-71.\n\nb. Green, Anna. \"Returning History to the Community: Oral History in a Museum Setting.\" The Oral History Review 24, no. 2 (December 1, 1997): 53-72.\n\n4. Sound I: Installation of Performance\n\nIf the intangible cultural heritage is something as abstract as live performance, the elements of living people inputs are unavoidable. The practices and theories regarding the staging of a live show in the museum setting are hinged on the issue of authenticity. How much control does a curator have over the accuracy of the performance?\n\nReading:\n\na. Pollock, Della, ed. Exceptional spaces: essays in performance and history (Chapter 1&2).

Sound II: Installation of Music\n\nMusical instruments are valuable museum objects, because they embodied the appreciation of music and the meticulous knowledge in physics and mathematics too. In a gallery as quiet as in a museum, how do we deliver or reconstruct ‘music’ for present-day enjoyment?\n\nReadings:\n\nGillespie, Kirsty. \"Musical Landscapes of Lihir: Exploring performance and place in a museum exhibition.\" Perfect Beat 17, no. 1 (2016): 9-24.\n\nPART II Auxiliary devices\n\n6. Use of Videos\n\nShowing a clip in the middle of the exhibition is a common practice. What are the conventions in so doing? What are the advantages and limits of applying animations and other digital devices?\n\nReading:\n\na.

Use of Dioramas\n\nDioramas are most useful in the area of Natural Science, because the extinguished animals and plants are best represented through live reconstructions. Historical museums often employ diorama to highlight the visiting experience.\n\nReading:\n\na. Knutson, Karen; Lyon, Mandela ; Crowley, Kevin ; Giarratani, Lauren. \"Flexible Interventions to Increase Family Engagement at Natural History Museum Dioramas.\" Curator: The Museum Journal 59, no. 4 (October 2016): 339-52.\n\nb.

Use of Miscellaneous Objects\n\nNot all objects are substantial or significant enough to be regarded as attractive. In fact, a number of museums nowadays are overflowed with objects of low historical values. How may we put them up in the gallery to complete the storyline, while not violating the boundary of over-interpretation?\n\nReadings\n\nHess, M.; Robson, S. \"3D imaging for museum artefacts: A portable test object for heritage and museum documentation of small objects.\" International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives 39 (2012): 103-08.\n\nPART III Museum Competitive Strategies\n\n9. The ‘Branch’ Strategy\n\nGugong (The Palace Museum) is going to set up a branch in Hong Kong. The branch strategy, however, is not a new thing. It began in the 1980s, when a number of century-old museums considered expansion and revenue-raising. This lecture reviews the many successful and unsuccessful cases in the past. What may be the risks for the new branch of Gugong in Hong Kong?\n\nReadings:\n\na.

Training I: museum curatorial workers\n\nIn-house trainings on a routine basis are an useful way to develop a coherent staff team. We will test the usefulness of the training package as suggested by ICOM and reflect on its rationale to run the museum as incorporation.\n\nUNESCO Running a Museum: A Practical Handbook, available online.\n\n11. Training II: museum non-curatorial workers\n\nCurators are usually not the first person a visitor sees or gets in touch with in the museum. There are receptionists, volunteers, security guards, caretakers, cafe waiters, etc. These people are parts of the museum. Together their bonding represents the brand of the museum. This lecture will again use the ICOM package and check the training programmes suggested in there.\n\nUNESCO Running a Museum: A Practical Handbook, available online.\n\n12. Museum Facilities\n\nCloakrooms, washrooms, disabled facilities, restaurants, and rest areas are essential in a museum nowadays. There is also the space outside the museum building. What are the potentials of fully utilizing those space for the purpose of building a coherent institution?\n\nReadings:\n\na. Gofman, Ale; Moskowitz, Howard R.; Mets, Tõnis. \"Marketing Museums and Exhibitions: What Drives the Interest of Young People.\" Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management 20, no. 6 (August 1, 2011): 601-618.\n\nb.

The Mass Produced Gifts at Gift Shops\n\nCoffee mugs, magnets, coasters, keychains, and many other mass produced objects are often found in the gift shops. The museums of China even develop online shop through the largest online shopping website. Are we tired of them yet? Let’s discuss the potential risks in the over-flooding gift shops. Is there a way out other than contracting a design company to produce goods of similar types and forms?\n\nReadings:\n\na.

      "description": "Cultural institutions such as museums, archives, and cultural centers play a critical role in the preservation, interpretation, and dissemination of heritage. Through diverse programs, place-making projects, and cultural policies, these institutions preserve and represent cultural memory, sustain community identity and continuity, and emphasize the importance of community involvement and participatory approaches. They ensure that both tangible and intangible heritage are accessible to the public and future generations. Additionally, they intersect with contemporary issues such as the impact of globalization, tourism, the role of policy-making and advocacy in heritage protection, and the influence of the digital age on cultural heritage.This course aims to provide students with both analytical and practical skills in managing cultural heritage, with a particular emphasis on intangible heritage, which includes oral histories, performative rituals, social practices, and craftsmanship. Students will engage with diverse topics, exploring how the principles and practices of heritage management inform a variety of theories and approaches, such as cultural relativism, ethnocentrism, and post-colonial theory. By focusing on a chosen area of cultural heritage or a particular field of heritage theory, this course will equip students with the ability to reflect on the challenges and opportunities presented by historical and current phenomena and to participate in projects with the potential to impact individuals and societies.",

      "description": "Curating in art and culture involves selecting and organizing artworks, cultural artifacts, practices, and narratives to create a cohesive exhibition that conveys a specific theme. This requires a deep understanding of the artists' intentions, the works' context, and diverse cultural expressions, as well as a commitment to preserving heritage and promoting dialogue. Curators play a crucial role in ensuring representation, authenticity, and inclusivity in the audience's experience. In recent years, the concept of curating has extended to social media, where it involves strategically choosing and presenting content to engage a digital audience. This includes managing visuals, texts, and interactive elements to create a compelling online presence. The term \"curating,\" once limited to museums, now applies broadly, reflecting the growing importance of thoughtful content curation in effectively engaging and informing diverse audiences across various platforms. This course aims to provide students with both analytical and practical skills in curation. Students will engage with diverse topics, exploring how various platforms offer unique opportunities for curators to select, organize, manage, and create artworks, artifacts, content, and knowledge. By covering various curatorial strategies in the ever-expanding field of knowledge production, this course will equip students with the ability to reflect on current phenomena and curate projects that have the potential to impact individuals and societies.",
