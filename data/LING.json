This course invites students to explore the central components of human language, examining its structure and functions, how it is acquired, and how it changes over time. Students will have an overview of the grammatical properties of language, with respect to its sounds and sound system (phonetics and phonology), words and word formation (morphology), sentence patterns (syntax), and meaning (semantics). The course will highlight the psychological and biological foundations of language, and the applications of linguistics to other fields. Students will develop a basic understanding of language as a computational system that interacts with other cognitive systems of the human brain. The course will also discuss the social aspects of language and the computational processing of human language. Students will become more sensitive to their own use of language, and develop an appreciation of recent advances in linguistic science, with respect to universals and particulars of language, language and society, language variation and change, language acquisition, as well as language, mind and the brain.",

      "description": "This course introduces some fundamental concepts in the study of syntax and looks at how the formation of phrases and sentences is principled and how syntactic rules are universal. These concepts will be introduced through grammatical structures accessible to the students, ranging from simple to complex constituents. The course enables students to see the capacity of the human linguistic system to form complex structures. Students will develop sensitivity toward natural language structures and gain hands-on experience of tackling syntactic problems in the form of a mini-project.",

How does one account systematically for ambiguities in the meaning of sentences? To what extent is the study of meaning independent of language context and use? This course examines how meaning is systematically coded in the grammar of natural languages through structural and empirical methods of semantic analysis at the word, sentence and utterance levels. Basic concepts such as sense and reference, lexical semantics, truth functionality in conjunction, disjunction, implication and contradiction, events and entities, as well as quantification will be included.",

Through critical discussion of selected cases, students will explore the ways in which one may arrive at generalizations based on linguistic evidence, how different analyses may apply to a given linguistic phenomenon, and the grounds on which one analysis may be judged to be superior to another. Standard arguments in linguistic analysis will be introduced with illustrations drawn from phonology, syntax and semantics. Concepts such as economy, internal consistency, pattern congruity, linguistically significant generalizations, and learnability will be highlighted.Special Note: Please remove the obsolete course LING2002 (Linguistics Argumentation II) from the course exclusion.",

How, for example, does one language community interacts with another language community in the multilingual world? Does language change and what are the processes involved? To what extent does the same language vary due to gender, power, status, and identity? How do men and women, people with higher and lower social status talk differently? How are these relationships reflected in the use of politeness markers and other linguistic devices? What are the implications of sociolinguistics on education and language planning? Through introducing students to major issues in sociolinguistic studies, students will be able to develop a better understanding of how language functions in societal contexts from a linguistic perspective. Discussions will also focus on common sociolinguistic phenomena in daily communication, with a specific emphasis on the use of various languages and dialects spoken in Hong Kong. Exploring these topics will enhance studentsâ€™ awareness of language as a cultural phenomenon and sharpen their sensitivity to the nuances of language use in the context of a multilingual world, with special reference to the sociolinguistic context of the Greater China area.",

Empirical linguistic data will be drawn across languages to enable students to understand the intimate relation between language and the human mind. On the basis of this understanding, students are led to explore the core areas of linguistics. The exploration starts with natural language sound systems and phonological components of grammar. These will be explained with basic concepts and recent theoretical advances in linguistic studies alongside new findings in language acquisition. Students will learn to apply these concepts and ideas to tackle linguistic problems.",

Emphasis will be placed on linguistic properties rather than psychological mechanisms or various techniques in psycholinguistic studies. The principles and mechanisms that underlie speech perception, sentence processing and discourse comprehension, as well as structural factors in language production form the focus of this course. This course first examines the unique features of human languages and the biological foundations of language. It then explores the perception of various linguistic aspects (speech sounds, words, sentences and discourse) before touching on issues in language production. Major models of language production and perception will be introduced. After examining different aspects of our language competence, this course concludes with a discussion of language and culture. However, issues related to the origin of language and language acquisition will not be covered in this course. Students are expected to be familiar with the basic concepts in phonetics, phonology, morphology and syntax.",

What is the relationship between language and cognitive development in bilingual children? Central questions in bilingual acquisition and methodological issues in investigating bilingual infants and children will be discussed. The development of bilingual and trilingual children in Hong Kong and overseas communities will be the focus of our discussion. Issues regarding how heritage speakers in North America and UK develop their heritage language and undergo language shift will also be discussed.",

Additionally, similar processes of language acquisition are observed when children acquire sign language in monolingual and bilingual contexts. Yet, differences in modality of communication, auditory versus visual, pose challenges to researchers in their attempts to account for the role of space and gesture in the organization of sign language grammar and language acquisition.

      "description": "This course presents an introduction to research designs and data analyses that are commonly used in experimental linguistic research. The course will emphasize on practical skills in data handling and analyses, in particularly using R. The course first introduces students to experimental designs as a prerequisite to statistics. Then it progresses from data distribution and descriptive statistics to gradually more complicated statistical techniques that are commonly used to analyze linguistic data (e.g., correlation, t-test, non-parametric tests, ANOVA, regression). With a focus on both conceptual understanding and practical skills in statistics, the course offers both lectures and also practical sessions where students have hands-on experience using R to analyze actual language data.",
