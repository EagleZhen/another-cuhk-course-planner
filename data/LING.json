      "description": "(UGED1924 is double-coded with LING1000.)\nThis course invites students to explore the central components of human language, examining its structure and functions, how it is acquired, and how it changes over time. Students will have an overview of the grammatical properties of language, with respect to its sounds and sound system (phonetics and phonology), words and word formation (morphology), sentence patterns (syntax), and meaning (semantics). The course will highlight the psychological and biological foundations of language, and the applications of linguistics to other fields. Students will develop a basic understanding of language as a computational system that interacts with other cognitive systems of the human brain.\n\nThe course will also discuss the social aspects of language and the computational processing of human language. Students will become more sensitive to their own use of language, and develop an appreciation of recent advances in linguistic science, with respect to universals and particulars of language, language and society, language variation and change, language acquisition, as well as language, mind and the brain.",

Students will be exposed to a wide range of grammatical constructions and trained to apply the descriptive approach to analyse them. The training will enrich students’ understanding of the grammatical categories and structure of English while consolidating their foundational knowledge of the language. References are also made to common errors in students’ English to raise their awareness of the problems in learning English. The course will deepen students’ sensitivity toward the subtleties and complexities in the structure of English and enable them to improve their accuracy in the use of English.",

How does one account systematically for ambiguities in the meaning of sentences? To what extent is the study of meaning independent of language context and use? This course examines how meaning is systematically coded in the grammar of natural languages through structural and empirical methods of semantic analysis at the word, sentence and utterance levels. Basic concepts such as sense and reference, lexical semantics, truth functionality in conjunction, disjunction, implication and contradiction, events and entities, as well as quantification will be included.",

      "description": "This course enhances students’ sensitivity to the structure of linguistic argumentation. Through critical discussion of selected cases, students will explore the ways in which one may arrive at generalizations based on linguistic evidence, how different analyses may apply to a given linguistic phenomenon, and the grounds on which one analysis may be judged to be superior to another. Standard arguments in linguistic analysis will be introduced with illustrations drawn from phonology, syntax and semantics. Concepts such as economy, internal consistency, pattern congruity, linguistically significant generalizations, and learnability will be highlighted.\n\nSpecial Note: Please remove the obsolete course LING2002 (Linguistics Argumentation II) from the course exclusion.",

      "description": "(UGEC2925 is double-coded with LING2301.)\nThis course explores human language in the broader context of culture and society. How, for example, does one language community interacts with another language community in the multilingual world? Does language change and what are the processes involved? To what extent does the same language vary due to gender, power, status, and identity? How do men and women, people with higher and lower social status talk differently? How are these relationships reflected in the use of politeness markers and other linguistic devices? What are the implications of sociolinguistics on education and language planning?\n\nThrough introducing students to major issues in sociolinguistic studies, students will be able to develop a better understanding of how language functions in societal contexts from a linguistic perspective. Discussions will also focus on common sociolinguistic phenomena in daily communication, with a specific emphasis on the use of various languages and dialects spoken in Hong Kong. Exploring these topics will enhance students’ awareness of language as a cultural phenomenon and sharpen their sensitivity to the nuances of language use in the context of a multilingual world, with special reference to the sociolinguistic context of the Greater China area.",

How did language evolve as a component of mind in the history of mankind? How does language develop in the individual in relation to other cognitive capacities? In what ways is the organization of language similar to and distinct from other systems of cognition? To what extent does habitual thought depend on language, and to what extent does language enhance thought? These issues will be addressed, with emphasis on the interfaces between language structure and conceptual systems in the expression of reference, time, space, quantification, and modality.",

The focus of the course is on basic concepts in natural language processing, and ambiguities in human-machine interaction. Through hands-on experience, students will gain a better understanding of the problems with current speech recognition software and natural language processing systems, and of how linguistic knowledge can help provide solutions to some of these problems.",

The emphasis will be on how linguistic knowledge can augment computational methods in natural language processing tasks. They will be given non-technical introduction to the basic idea/rationale behind the computational algorithms. Students will be able to appreciate the synergy of the field of Linguistics and Computer Science.\n\n2. Students will have a good understanding of the data-oriented methodology, e.g. the use of corpus data, training, testing, and evaluation.\n\n3. Apart from learning the concepts, students will learn to use some user-friendly tools to do some simple text processing and analysis themselves.",
      "course_syllabus": "1. Introduction--It provides a general introduction to the significance of IT on linguistics and vice versa. An overview of natural language processing research and practical everyday IT applications will be provided. The strengths and limitations of computers and its implications to language processing will be discussed.\n\n2. Tokenization, stemming and word segmentation--Text processing begins with tokenization of text chunks. While it looks like an easy task, it is a non-trivial task for computers. Special attention will be given to the Chinese word segmentation problem where word boundaries are not explicitly indicated in the Chinese writing system.\n\n3. Part-of-speech (POS) tagging--POS tagging is a task that enhances the information of the text and critically affects further text processing. POS tagging schemes will be reviewed. The bigram approach to tagging will be demonstrated.\n\n4. Corpora-based training and testing--In the last 20 years, the field of natural language processing is dominated by the corpus-oriented approach in all sorts of tasks. This is also an area where linguists’ contribution is important. We will demonstrate how corpora can be used to train and test word segmenter and POS tagger.\n\n5. Tag Cloud / Search Engine -- The bag-of-words model will be introduced as the general representation of text documents. The generic representation enables computers to quantify the relative “importance” of words in texts so that keywords or chunks can be selected for retrieval.\n\n6. Email Spam Filtering / Sentiment Analysis--Despite their superficially very different functions, both applications can be considered to be particular examples of document classification. We will discuss how corpus-based machine learning methods make use of keyword in documents to classify documents into different categories.\n\n7. Speech recognition--Students will be introduced to the basic principle behind the mapping of speech signals to words. Concepts include formant, spectrum, Fourier transformation, etc. Statistical strategy (just the idea, not the math) to recover words from phones will be examined.",

What are the stages they go through in mastering the different aspects of language? What does the development of language in children tell us about the human language faculty? These questions will be examined in light of modern linguistic theory, and nativist and interactionist accounts will be compared. Topics in second language acquisition will also be covered. Questions such as how interlanguage grammars develop in adults and the role of the mother tongue in the construction of interlanguage grammar will be addressed.",

This course first examines the unique features of human languages and the biological foundations of language. It then explores the perception of various linguistic aspects (speech sounds, words, sentences and discourse) before touching on issues in language production. Major models of language production and perception will be introduced. After examining different aspects of our language competence, this course concludes with a discussion of language and culture. However, issues related to the origin of language and language acquisition will not be covered in this course.\nStudents are expected to be familiar with the basic concepts in phonetics, phonology, morphology and syntax.",

      "description": "Linguistic inquiry into sign language structure reveals universal principles of linguistic organization shared by sign languages and spoken languages, in phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and pragmatics. Additionally, similar processes of language acquisition are observed when children acquire sign language in monolingual and bilingual contexts. Yet, differences in modality of communication, auditory versus visual, pose challenges to researchers in their attempts to account for the role of space and gesture in the organization of sign language grammar and language acquisition. This introductory course aims to address these issues.",

Signed and spoken languages share principles and constraints of linguistic organization at different levels\n2. There are modality effects and non-effects in sign language structure and acquisition",
      "course_syllabus": "Modality of communication\nIt refers to the medium through which linguistic signals are transmitted to achieve a communicative outcome. The medium, oral versus signed, may lead to interesting linguistic and processing consequences\n\nSpatial grammar\nA term often adopted by sign linguists to refer to how sign languages use space in the construction of grammar\n\nVerb Typology\nSign languages display an interesting phenomenon of classifying verbs according to whether they use space or not and whether the verbal root is comprised, instead of a conglomeration of phonological components, movement or handshape, depending on the theoretical approach one adopts. In the literature, verbs in signed languages can be roughly classified into plain verbs, spatial verbs, agreement verbs and classifier verbs.\n\nCode-blending\nIt is a form of code-mixing phenomena where signers ‘stack’ elements of both sign language and spoken language simultaneously in language production. It also implies that signers may access two grammars not only in production, but also comprehension, as shown by empirical findings in bilingual processing research.",

Then it progresses from data distribution and descriptive statistics to gradually more complicated statistical techniques that are commonly used to analyze linguistic data (e.g., correlation, t-test, non-parametric tests, ANOVA, regression). With a focus on both conceptual understanding and practical skills in statistics, the course offers both lectures and also practical sessions where students have hands-on experience using R to analyze actual language data.",
