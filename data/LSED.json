It enables students to acquire a deeper understanding of subject knowledge in this specific Area of Study, think about subject knowledge from the students’ perspectives, apply subject knowledge from the perspective of multidisciplinary teaching, and organize instructional strategies of issue-based teaching in relevant conceptual and contextual considerations.\nThe focus will be placed on understanding the scientific and technological principles and social implications of “Public Health and Technology” and “Energy and the Environment”. Students will be guided to apply relevant subject knowledge and skills in these areas to discuss and enquire into various related issues in order to reach evidence-based judgment and decisions. The implications of the processes and the results from these enquiries on the learning and teaching of Liberal Studies will be fully discussed.",

In the first part of the course, students will be provided an overview on the theoretical and pedagogical underpinnings of the subject, including the curriculum classification “integrated curriculum”; the guiding philosophical principles “constructivist and student-centered approaches”; and pedagogic practice “issue-enquiry approach.”.\nIn the second part of the course, the liberal studies approach to knowledge and education will be applied to inquire into three areas of studies in the context of the twenty-first century. The areas are (1) self and personal development, (2) society and culture, and (3) science, technology and the environment. These three areas are basically in correspondence with the three areas of study stipulated in syllabus of the Liberal Studies in the Hong Kong senior-secondary curriculum. In each area, concepts and theories related to the areas of inquiry are introduced. It attempts to lay the pedagogical foundation for the teaching and learning of liberal studies in secondary schools in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.",
