Basic theoretical justification is also provided. The content covers three broad themes: (i) rank-type and order-type methods for handling location, dispersion, correlation, distribution and regression problems, (ii) resampling-type procedures for testing and assessing precision, and (iii) smoothing-type techniques for estimation and prediction. Topics include Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney rank sum test, Spearman’s rho, Kendall’s tau, Kruskal-Wallis test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, bootstrapping, Jackknife, subsampling, permutation tests, kernel method, k-nearest neighbour, tree-based method, classification, etc.",

      "description": "The models considered in this course answer the questions “if this event happens, what could happen next and with what probability?”. Thinking along these lines naturally leads us to conditional probability and conditional expectation and thereafter to discrete time Markov Chains. In the second half of the course, we study Poisson processes and their numerous attractive properties, before then generalising them to birth and death processes and ultimately continuous time Markov Chains. If time permits, we shall also look at Renewal Processes and Queueing Systems.",

A wide spectrum of problems in statistics and machine learning can be formulated as optimization tasks. This course aims to introduce the elements of convex optimization, concentrating on modeling aspects and algorithms that are useful in statistics and data science applications. Topics include convex sets, convex functions, linear and quadratic programs, semidefinite programming, and duality theory. We will visit important applications in statistics and machine learning to demonstrate the wide applicability of convex optimization. We will also cover effective optimization algorithms like gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.",

Emphasis is put on various topics on multilayer artificial neural networks, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and also Reinforcement Learning (RL). About their usage, CNN brings new insights into image classification, and also helps to digitalize business information; GAN finds wide applications in speech recognition and text-mining; RNN is very useful for hand-writing recognition; reinforcement learning enables effective decision making in rapidly changing environments such as financial markets. Statistical packages including R, EXCEL and Python will be used to demonstrate these methods. Examples from financial and business contexts will be accentuated in this course. The students taking this course are expected to have acquired basic background knowledge on calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics as prerequisites.",
