Taking a step by step approach, this course comprises three parts, which will guide students from the general concepts right through to the core thoughts of various schools of cultural theories. It will firstunfold an overall picture and introducethe basic concepts enshrined in the theories. It will then illustrate the developing process of cultural theories by tracing the critical moments and key authors. The final part will discuss a broad range of thoughts that come from Structuralism, Post-structuralism, Marxism, Psychoanalysis, Postmodernism etc., and the social contexts from which they arose. This course is designed especially for cultural management students,integrating cases and practices of cultural industry and popular art.",

      "learning_outcomes": "Students are expected to understand and explain the key concepts in cultural theory, the evolution of different theories and major schools of thoughts. Students will also understand the relationship between culture and society, the differentiation between high and low culture, and the interplay between cultural traditions and cultural differences and diversities. Open exploration, in-depth observation and creative application of theories will be encouraged and developed.",
      "course_syllabus": "Part I. Basic Concepts in Cultural Theory\nPart One provides an overview of cultural theory, introducing the discipline of cultural studies, the concept of ‘theory,’and cultural theory.Key concepts in cultural theory, such as ideology, representation, articulation, and texts and readers, will bediscussed.\n\n1. Overview: Cultural Studies and Cultural Theory\nThis introductory section discusses what ‘theory’ means, why we need theory, what cultural theory is and how it works. It also introduces the discipline of cultural studies as well as the definitions of culture from major theoretical perspectives.\n\n2. Culture and Ideology\nIdeology is a key concept in cultural theory. This section explores the political role of culture in society and discusses the relationship between culture and ideology. It provides five definitions of ideology and shows the way in which ideology works.\n\n3. Representation and Materialism\nMuch of cultural theoryis dedicated to explaining how meaning is produced symbolically in language. Two important concepts are relevant: representation explores the textual generation of meaning and the modes; materialism is concerned with why meanings are inscribed at the moment of production. This section also discusses how meaning is produced in the interplay betweentext and reader.\n\n4. Subjectivity and Psychoanalysis\nThe concepts of subjectivity and psychoanalysis are introduced in this section. It also introduces the Freudian self, which comprises ‘an ego,’ ‘a superego’ and ‘the unconscious.’ The relationship between these concepts and cultural theory literature is also discussed.\n\nPart II. Evolution of Cultural Theory\nPart Two illustrates the developing process of cultural theory, discussing key authors and their contributions in the ‘culture and civilization’ tradition and culturalism.\n\n5. The ‘Culture and Civilization’ Tradition\nMatthew Arnold inaugurates a tradition which places popular culture within the general field of culture, known as the ‘culture and civilization’ tradition. Carrying on this tradition, F.R. Leavis has shaped the understanding of mass civilization and minority culture. This section introduces the ‘culture and civilization’ tradition and its connection to popular art.\n\n6. Culturalism I: Hoggart, Williams and Thompson\nCulturalism has been the most vigorous, indigenous strand within cultural studies in Britain. Hoggart, Williams and Hall exemplify the critical moments of the evolution of cultural theory. This section will introduce their works and discuss the influence of their thoughts in shaping later theories.\n\n7. Culturalism II: Hall and Whanneland the Popular Arts\nHoggart, Williams and Thompson have a major influence on the understanding of the popular arts. Stuart Hall and Paddy Whannel’s thesis, The Popular Arts, will be discussed. This section will examine the categorical difference between high and popular culture, and the characteristics of difference.\n\nPart III. Intellectual Strands of Cultural Theory\nPart Three introduces major intellectual strands of cultural theories, ranging from Structuralism, Post-structuralism, Marxism, Feminism toPost-modernism.\n\n8. Structuralism: Generating Meaning from Structure\nStructuralism is a theoretical method of approaching texts and practices.This section will introducethe origin, trajectory of structuralism as well as its principle of analysis. Roland Barthes’s analysis of mythology based on principles of structuralism will be discussed.\n\n9. Post-structuralism: Meaning in Process\nPost-structuralists reject the idea of deriving meanings from an underlying structure. The ideas and works of Jacques Derrida and Jacques Lacan will be introduced. This section will also discuss the works by Michel Foucault and Edward Said regarding discourse and power.\n\n10. Marxism I: Classical Marxism and Neo-Gramscian Studies\nThis section will begin with the introduction of a classical Marxist approach to culture, such as its famous ‘base/superstructure’ account of social and historical development, the determinations that influence the production and consumption of popular culture, and the mode of production. Itwill then proceed to discuss Antonio Gramsci and the core concept of hegemony.\n\n11. Marxism II: The Frankfurt School and Cultural Industry\nThe Frankfurt School has been famous for its critical theory that mixes Marxism and psychoanalysis,as well as the term of ‘cultural industry’ that it coined. This section will introduce the basic concepts of the Frankfurt School, the major representative figures and their critique of cultural industry.\n\n12. Feminism and Gender\nGender has been an important subject of study since the 1980s. Several issues will be discussed in this section, such as cultural politics and feminist psychoanalysis. Women in popular culture, e.g., films and fictions,will be adopted as cases for study.\n\n13. Postmodernism: Relocating Value in the World of Everyday Experience\nThe development of Postmodern theory became mature with theorization in the work of Jean-Francois Lyotard and has changed the theoretical and the cultural basis of the study of popular culture in its development. This lecture will illustrate the trajectory of postmodernism and focuses on its connection to various arts forms and popular culture.",

      "description": "Archaeology reveals many interesting findings about ancient social lives. Food has always been an essential category in human culture. The amount of food surplus determines the strength and social bonding of a society; and rituals are usually revolved around food preparation, presentation, and distribution.\nIn China, a large number of archaeological sites contained remains of food, and occasionally drink. This course picks the representative sites to illustrate what food meant to a society that can be summarized in categories listed below:\n1. Consumption of staple food: rice and noodles; 2. Perception of tastes: sweetness and bitterness; 3. Cooking methods: steaming and roasting; 4. Exotic food: what had been imported to China and when?\n5. Drinks: tea and wine; 6. Rituals that involved food.\n\nThis course is suitable for students who have interests in Archaeology but may not have prior knowledge about it. It aims to prepare them for exploring the past of China in the future, either in form of class teaching or self-learning, or both. The course gets students to apply the designs and innovations of ancient China in regards to food and the practice of cooking, dining and rituals to the present.",

      "course_syllabus": "Part I: Discoveries of food and drinks\n\n1. Introduction: Food, climate, and geography\n\nNatural environment determines the type of staple food in different regions. This introductory lecture explains the basics of fauna archaeology and the various devices available to identify food and drinks ingredients.\n\nReading:\n\nLiu Li and Chen Xingcan. ‘Neolithization: sedentism and food production in the Early Neolithic (7000—5000 BC)’ (chapter 5), The Archaeology of China: From the Late Paleolithic to the Early Bronze Age. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 123—168.\n\n2. Rice and Hemudu Culture (5500—3300 BC)\n\nCarbonated rice husk was found in a number of early and mid-Neolithic sites in China. All evidence points to the origins in the mid and lower Yangtze River valley. This lecture uses Hemudu site as an example. The excavations over the last decades revealed many earliest finds in this Neolithic culture: rice paddy field, musical instruments, fortune-telling devices, etc.\n\nReading:\n\na. 《河姆渡: 新石器考古遺址發掘報告》北京 : 文物出版社 2003\n\nb. 賀聖達，《稻米之路:中國與東南亞稻作業的起源和發展》,《東方論壇》2013年05期，第23-30頁。\n\n3. Noodles and the site of Lajia of Qijia Culture (c.2500—c.2000 BC)\n\nLajia of Qinghai province is the Chinese version of Pompeii. It was a small town destroyed and covered by dust right after an earthquake. There preserved a bow of unfinished noodles made of millet (小米) and husk millet (黍米). The noodles still carried a tinge of the original yellowish colour. This lecture begins with the finds at Lajia and refers to many other archaeological evidence of noodles consumption found in later periods.\n\nReading:\n\na. 王明輝，《青海民和喇家遺址發掘報告》,《考古》2000.12, 第12—28页。\n\nb. 葉茂林，《喇家遺址與飲食文明》，《中國飲食文化》2008，4(2)，45—76。\n\n4. Jiaozi (Dumplings) and the State of Xue (?—327 BC)\n\nJiaozi takes in different forms in Chinese cuisine. The earliest evidence came from a site in the State of Xue of the Warring States period (c.476—221 BC). This lecture uses Xue as the introductory point and unfolds the story of the many states and their finds from the period before the First Emperor unified China.\n\nReading:\n\na. 薛國故城勘查和墓葬發掘報告《考古學報》1991.4。\n\nb. 印群，《論春秋時期魯東南殉人墓隨葬青銅禮器的特點 —兼談莒、薛文化因素之異同》，《齊魯學刊》2015.3，40—46。\n\n5. Meat and wine and the Xianyang Airport site\n\nIn 2009, a bowl of meat soup was found in Xi’an. Domesticated pigs, sheep and ox were found in as early as late Neolithic. Boiling was the primary method of cooking. In Xi’an this tomb of the Han dynasty revealed the soup serving, as well as bottle of wine. This lecture illustrates a banquet in association with the many bronze cooking and serving vessels found.\n\nReading:\n\na.陕西省考古研究院，《西安咸陽國際機場專用高速公路十六國墓發掘簡報》，《文博》2009.4，3—11。\n\nb. 陝西省考古研究所，《漢陽陵》，北京︰文物，2006。\n\n6. Fieldtrip: Sauces and Seasoning\n\nSauces are not commonly found at archaeological sites. Because Hong Kong has a number of locally produced sauce workshops, a fieldtrip to one of them is enriching. The arrangement has to be made in due course. Otherwise, the fieldtrip may be a visit to a relevant museum exhibition in Hong Kong or Shenzhen.\n\n7. Snacks and the early Han-dynasty tombs of Mawangdui, Hunan province\n\nWhen food surplus is sufficient, snacks are desired. At Mawangdui, the tomb of the wife of the regional lord contained bottles of nuts, chestnut, and other food.\n\nReading:\n\na. 《馬王堆漢墓帛書》，北京︰文物，1980—85。\n\nb. 陳建明，《馬王堆漢墓研究》，長沙︰岳麓書社，2013。\n\n8. Tofu and the Han-dynasty Tomb at Mixian Dahuting, Henan province\n\nTofu was not preserved in any archaeological site. But the process of making tofu was recorded. At Mixian, the relief paintings found in the tomb illustrate the tofu-making processes in detail, along with other cooking and food preparing pictures. It remains a mystery as to why the people of the Han preserved such scenes in burials. But they provided insightful details about how these people perceived of food in relation to their afterlife.\n\nReading:\n\na. 河南省文物研究所，《密縣打虎亭漢墓》，北京︰文物，1993。\n\nb. 馮麗麗，《秦漢飲食略考》，《宜春學院學報 》，2010，32(11)，79—81。\n\n9. Bread and the Western Xia Hoard of Inner Mongolia\n\nBread or bun did not survive well in most archaeological sites. But a hoard of Western Xia in Inner Mongolia revealed several well-preserved pieces. The Inner Asian forms of these finds related them to the Silk Road. In fact, a number of dried food examples came from that part of the world, because the dry weather favoured preservation.\n\nReading:\n\na. 伊克昭盟文物工作站，《准格爾旗發現西夏窖藏》，《文物》1987.8。\n\nb. 王仁湘，《考古貴州》，電視廣播資源。\n\n10. Tea and the Liao-dynasty tombs of Xuanhua, Hebei province\n\nTea leaves have always been important in China. The cemetery at Xunhua belonged to a Han family living in the Liao regime. There were many pictures of tea preparation and serving.\n\nReading:\n\n《宣化遼墓︰1974—1993年考古發掘報告》，北京，文物，2001。\n\n11. Exotic food\n\nChili, spices, potatoes, and a number of essential ingredients in Chinese cuisines came from abroad at different times. How did they manage to enter an established food culture?\n\n12. Guest lecture\n\nIn China, food is a topic inevitably related to health, festivals and rituals. It will be exciting to include a lecture to be given by a specialist in Religious Studies, Chinese Medicine, or Maritime Trade, who has research interests in food. The lecture provides another dimension of looking at Chinese food.\n\n13. Food and rituals\n\nIn conclusion, food is indispensable in social lives and rituals. In the examples discussed, food was always found in tombs, closely associated with the desires of nourishment, social engagement, and even hierarchy. Today, what’s the role of food in our ‘rituals’? And how do we shape ‘rituals’ through different food?",

      "description": "(GENA2372 is double-coded with CUMT2013.)\n\nThe course examines the correlation between art and institutions in twentieth-century China, aiming to encourage students to think about modern Chinese art through the concept of the artworld. The downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republican China transformed the social and institutional organisation of the production, distribution, and consumption of art as well as the traditional patronage system in modern China. The structural changes conditioned the emergence of formal and informal art institutions that facilitated yet constrained artistic practices, laying the foundation for the development of a modern art world in China. The course looks at the history of modern Chinese art and the formation of different art institutions in the sociocultural and economic context of modern China. Weekly topics are structured chronologically and thematically, which cover a wide range of themes, including art schools, art societies, museums, exhibitions, and art market. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, the course offers students multi-perspectives to understand the transformation of modern Chinese art and the interactions between artistic practices and society in modern China.",

In this course, students are expected to be able to integrate the knowledge and skills that they learnt into a research project. This course has two specific objectives. First, it aims to allow the students to experience completing a coherent research project either by participating in faculty-directed projects as a research group member or conducting independent research under supervision. Second, it will help students develop the preliminary idea of applying theories to answering research questions. This can be done by adopting a constructivist approach with cultural theories to account for a certain phenomenon pertinent to cultural management, or by identifying resolutions based on positive social science theories for cultural management. A faculty member will be assigned based on the student’s area of interest for the research project.",

      "course_syllabus": "The students will work closely with their supervisor, starting from the second semester of year 3. In the middle of the semester, the students will submit their proposals, which should include literature review, research topic/focus, research question/problem identification, and research design. The key literature of the specialized area should also be identified. The students will be required to prepare and to have an annotated bibliography approved by the supervisor. The literature review should include the mainstream knowledge for doing cultural management in a specialized area, the nature of the management process, and the political, economic, and organizational contexts, in which cultural management is done.\n\nA research topic or focus will be developed based on the observation and interest of the students. The students should seek the advice of the supervisor in deciding the topic or focus, and in doing the succeeding research design. Materials covered under research design include problem identification, hypothesis generation, and major issue and concept. The supervisor will also advise students about the basic qualitative and quantitative research methods, such as statistical methods, interview, and participatory observation, appropriate to developing a conceptual framework. Alternatively, students may identify a social phenomenon pertinent to cultural management or a cultural phenomenon represented by artistic or intellectual works. Students will be encouraged to apply computer-programming techniques covered in related courses.\n\nStudents who participate in faculty directed research projects may have the opportunity to avail of partial or full funding for their research and field trips depending on the funding situation. Their work should contribute to the research projects of their supervisors. The students will be advised on how to fulfill the required research tasks and improve their academic writing techniques.\n\nThis research project will lead to the completion of a thesis or its equivalent, and further studies at the graduate level. Part of the final product will be a presentation on the research project open to the university. The date for presentation is subject to future arrangements.",

      "course_syllabus": "The internship is typically taken by BA degree students within a cultural agency or organization during the summer vacation period at the end of the third year. The duration of the internship is six to eight weeks and it is normally full-time work (240-320 hours), subject to the agreement with the corresponding party. There might be exceptional cases in which students are engaged in part-time internship programmes held during the academic year because of the scheduling of specific arts projects.\n\nDuring the internship, students are expected to maximize the opportunities to access the staff, board meetings, internal and cross-organizational communications, in order to develop the understanding of the operation of the organization through participatory observation. To enhance on-job professional experience, the students are expected to complete professional management tasks independently or as a member of the agency’s management team with maximized exposure to the entire management process. The students’ internship will be largely in the charge of a field supervisor in the agency. It is important to have adequate on-job supervision that clarifies the policies and job requirements. The student’s supervisor in the Programme will provide advices regarding how to prepare the students for the working environment, carry out on-site observations, and write the final report. The Programme endorses the students’ full-time/part-time internships to fulfill the requirement for the BA degree.\n\nList of available organizations will be announced and interviews arranged normally three to four months prior to actual participation of internship, Students are required to identify three options of organizations, with advices from the internship panel. Arrangement will be made for interviews and the final decisions are to be made by the organizations.\n\nOption is opened for students to suggest organizations that are not of the list provided by the Programme. The suggested organizations must meet the following criteria: 1) Confirmed interest in offering internship; 2) Established organization with proper operational office, full time staff and creditable reputation; 3) Could provide a safe and proper learning/working environment; 4) No possible conflict of interest or personal linkage that might affect the final assessment. Based on the above criteria, the internship panel would make decision regarding the inclusion of the organizations into the internship programme.\n\nStudents are urged to timely hand in copies of documentary outputs, if any, of the intern employment, or reports prepared as a part of their internship experience. Arrangement for discussions with their Programme supervisors regarding the internship experience and critiques is encouraged. Students’ performance during the intern should be assessed by their field supervisors. A reviewing letter from the supervisor should be submitted, which contributes to the students’ final grades. In addition to the field supervisors’ assessment, students’ final report and a presentation open to the university are required and will be graded.\n\nIn case the student prefers academic pursuit or has tried and failed to obtain an internship, the student may consider conducting an individual research project or participating in faculty-directed research projects as specified in “CUMT4102 Research Project.”",
