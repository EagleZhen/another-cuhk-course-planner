The pharmacotherapy of disorders associated with various organ systems are discussed in a modular system over four terms. In each module, the general pathology together with the clinical features, diagnostic and monitoring parameters of the therapy are to be introduced. The course will provide the student with an understanding of the mechanisms of action, pharmacological effects, clinical indications and relevant side effects of the most important drugs used. The modules of diseases/drugs covered include central nervous system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, immunological system, endocrine system, chemotherapy and others. Pharmacoeconomic analysis and its role in pharmacotherapy will also be discussed.",

The course will provide the student with an understanding of the mechanisms of action, pharmacological effects, clinical indications and relevant side effects of the most important drugs used. The modules of diseases/drugs covered include central nervous system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, immunological system, endocrine system, chemotherapy and others. Pharmacoeconomic analysis and its role in pharmacotherapy will also be discussed.",
