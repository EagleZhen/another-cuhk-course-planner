      "description": "This course identifies the corporate governance challenges for companies in China and East Asia, and explores various mechanisms for strengthening their governance systems. We pay particular attention to the corporate governance issues of state-owned firms and entrepreneurial / family-controlled firms, which are prevalent in China and East Asia.The course adopts a multi-disciplinary approach, using theories from economics, law, political science and sociology, to provide a theoretical framework for understanding the different ownership structures and corporate governance systems around the world. Combining theories with practical knowledge of corporate governance practice, we tackle issues such as government intervention on state and non-state firms, accounting opacity and fraud, ineffective board monitoring, expropriation of controlling owners against minority shareholders, and succession in family firms.",

The course is divided into two parts. Broadly, the first two-thirds of the course focuses more on analytic and strategic frameworks for managing innovation. This segment examines patterns of technological change and their impacts, planning for technological transitions, means for capturing economic benefits from innovation, and planning of innovation projects over time. The last third of the course examines more organizational issues involved in implementing strategies. These issues include management of teams and partnerships, learning within and across projects, the manager's role in forecasting and funding, directing and stopping innovation projects, technological entrepreneurship, and barriers to innovation. Case studies, both written and video-based, are used extensively to illustrate a range of technologies and the problems associated with developing them and bringing them to market.",
