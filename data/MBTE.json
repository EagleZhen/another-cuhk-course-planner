      "description": "Knowledge in microbial technology is growing exponentially throughout the discovery of novel sequences of hundreds of microorganisms and the advancement of new technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. This course examines the application of the latest technologies in microbial biotechnology to environment, agriculture, industry and medicine. Selected topics include applied microbial physiology; genetic engineering; genomics and proteomics; metabolomics and biosynthetic pathway analysis and industrial fermentation technology. Examples of applications include microbial production of single-cell proteins, protein engineering, primary and secondary metabolites. Plant/animal – microbe interactions and microbial technology in biocatalysis, biodegradation and bioremediation will also be discussed. Two project orientated laboratory sections will also be included. Students will gain hands-on experience on conducting latest microbial biotechnology researches.",
