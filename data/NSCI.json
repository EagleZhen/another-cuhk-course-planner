      "description": "Nature is full of wonders, beauty and wisdom. For so long we have been trying to learn ‘about’ nature. In fact there are so much we can learn ‘from’ it as if nature is our mentor. Biomimicry is about learning from Nature and emulate their designs to innovate sustainable solutions. For example, the hooks found on burs has inspired the invention of Velcro®, a fabric hook and loop fastener.Biomimicry provides an excellent platform to engage students in collaborative problem-based and integrated learning to solve real-world problems. Students will learn to work together and develop their creative problem-solving skills through identifying meaningful questions, searching relevant and credible information, developing sustainable solutions, and evaluating and sharing their solutions. It provides a new perspective for students to view questions differently and appreciate and value the natural world that we all share and live in.",

It aims to assist students in planning their career paths during their undergraduate studies.Participants will learn how to search for a range of science jobs related to their discipline and prepare a list of categorized potential careers. They will develop a comprehensive career plan that encompasses both academic and career preparation. Students are expected to reflect on and explore their own interests, strengths, and weaknesses, and will learn to self-assess their academic and non-academic achievements. Additionally, they will be taught how to create portfolios, personal statements, and CVs that effectively highlight their strengths specifically in science fields. The course will also provide opportunities for students to practice interviews, helping them build confidence in these critical contexts.",
