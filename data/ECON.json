The principal aim is to help students plan their curricula, including the academic and experiential components. It comprises three parts:\n\n1. Lectures that introduce the structure of the programme (outcome statement, study pattern of required and elective courses, concentration areas), experiential learning opportunities (mentorship and internship programmes), and exchange opportunities (choice of host institutions and transfer of credits). Senior students may also be asked to share their experiences in mentorship, internship, and exchange.\n\n2. Workshops on academic writing with emphasis on academic honesty. Topics include plagiarism, proper use of source materials, and citation styles. Each student will be asked to write and submit a summary of a collection of articles on a current topic in economics. Feedbacks will be given in a timely manner so that students can correct their errors and resubmit their work. A series of revisions and submissions will finally lead to academically acceptable articles – writings with clear logic, proper use of source materials, and proper citation style.\n\n3. Sessions on presentation skills and interview skills. These include in-class debate sessions, group interview practices and cover-letter workshops.\n\n(Advisory: Course designed for students in their first year of major study in ECON. Capacity limited. Priority given to ECON major students.)",

To unravel the inner logic of the Chinese financial system, the course examines the various components of the financial sector, e.g., the banking sector, the foreign exchange market, the money market and the equity market. In addition, the challenges confronting China’s financial sector in the new millennium are explored. Among the special topics discussed are China’s accession to the WTO, the liberalization of interest rates, capital account liberalization, the choice of exchange rate arrangement for renminbi as well as measures to resolve the risks of the financial sector.

Advanced theories of business cycles such as the New Classical and New Keynesian approaches, are studied. It also provides an introduction to models of endogenous growth and technological change. Topics include: dynamic macro models of finite and infinite horizon, monetary growth models, search models, new growth models, and models of income distribution. This course strikes a balance between theoretical developments and empirical studies in modern macroeconomics. This course is particularly suitable for students who aspire to doing graduate work. Students are advised to take ECON1111 and 3021 before taking this course.",

The main goal of this course is to equip students with the basic economic intuitions and modeling techniques needed for further exploration in macroeconomic research. The course is divided into two parts. In Part 1 (Economic Growth), students will learn the modern analysis of economic growth. Basic growth theory, growth and development accounting will first be covered. Then new directions on the theories of growth and development will be studied, including an introduction of different models of endogenous growth and technological change. In Part 2 (Foundations of Modern Macroeconomics), important background and computational knowledge of macroeconomics beyond the Classical and Keynesian schools will be covered, including an introduction to Dynamic Programming, Real Business Cycle Theory and introductory macroeconometrics.",

      "description": "Large-scale data set has become increasingly available in many fields of economics. This presents challenges to statistical inference and even merely “understanding” the data. Meanwhile, it offers abundant opportunities for new inquiries and answers. In this course, we introduce the core statistical methods to work with big data (structured and unstructured) and show how these techniques can be combined with econometric tools in economics research. While we cover major machine learning tools, including supervised learning methods, unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction, we will focus on their concrete applications in current empirical research. Examples will be drawn from various lines of research, including text as data, relevant prediction problems in economics, and causal inference.",

What goods do countries trade? How does openness to trade shape countries' industrial structure and global production sharing? The course also concerns the normative issues, such as: Is trade beneficial to everyone, or are there winners and losers? What is the impact of trade on economic growth, wage inequality and poverty? All these issues will be discussed both from theories and empirics, as well as at country, industry and firm level. In particular, we will also discuss the ongoing US-China trade war.",
