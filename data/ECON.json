      "description": "This course is designed for economic majors in their first year of study. The principal aim is to help students plan their curricula, including the academic and experiential components. It comprises three parts:1. Lectures that introduce the structure of the programme (outcome statement, study pattern of required and elective courses, concentration areas), experiential learning opportunities (mentorship and internship programmes), and exchange opportunities (choice of host institutions and transfer of credits). Senior students may also be asked to share their experiences in mentorship, internship, and exchange.2. Workshops on academic writing with emphasis on academic honesty. Topics include plagiarism, proper use of source materials, and citation styles. Each student will be asked to write and submit a summary of a collection of articles on a current topic in economics. Feedbacks will be given in a timely manner so that students can correct their errors and resubmit their work. A series of revisions and submissions will finally lead to academically acceptable articles – writings with clear logic, proper use of source materials, and proper citation style. 3. Sessions on presentation skills and interview skills. These include in-class debate sessions, group interview practices and cover-letter workshops.(Advisory: Course designed for students in their first year of major study in ECON. Capacity limited. Priority given to ECON major students.)",

      "description": "This course introduces the approaches and methods used in modern macroeconomics. The main goal of this course is to equip students with the basic economic intuitions and modeling techniques needed for further exploration in macroeconomic research. The course is divided into two parts. In Part 1 (Economic Growth), students will learn the modern analysis of economic growth. Basic growth theory, growth and development accounting will first be covered. Then new directions on the theories of growth and development will be studied, including an introduction of different models of endogenous growth and technological change. In Part 2 (Foundations of Modern Macroeconomics), important background and computational knowledge of macroeconomics beyond the Classical and Keynesian schools will be covered, including an introduction to Dynamic Programming, Real Business Cycle Theory and introductory macroeconometrics.",

As one of the most important \"goods\", how health care is financed and delivered has large welfare implications. In this course, we will apply methods and reasoning from microeconomics to the health care sector. In particular, we will investigate different aspects of the health care system and assess how various policies affect the functioning of the health care system.",
