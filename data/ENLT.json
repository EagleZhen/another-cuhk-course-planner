This course will also introduce sociolinguistics and study the ways in which groups of people use language, examining the close intertwining between a language and the social context in which it is used. Bilingualism and bilingual education in different contexts will be examined, with particular reference to Hong Kong. Aspects of language variation and dialects, societal bilingualism and multilingualism, language and power, and language policy and planning issues, together with the function of the second language and principles underlying the use of English as a medium of instruction in Hong Kong will also be covered.",
