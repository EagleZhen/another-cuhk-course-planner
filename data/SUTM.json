Introductory lectures identify various types of heritage (tangible and intangible) and provide an understanding of the concept, scope and evolution of cultural-heritage tourism. Issues of cultural and artistic authenticity, identity production and marketing, and commodification of both tourists and the toured will further be examined. Case studies from Hong Kong and other parts of the world will be studied to identify specific socio-economic and cultural costs and benefits associated with this kind of tourism. The course will also explore approaches and policies of cultural heritage management and conservation to enable sustainable tourism development, with particular emphasis on the cases of Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta.",

It will investigate and seek to understand policy implications of ecotourism development. While ecotourism is the fastest growing sector of the world's tourism industry, it is still not well understood. Where ecotourism is being conceived and practiced, there is often a dearth of knowledge in ecotourism policy aspects. The course will draw on examples of various tourism policy initiatives with approaches concerning the environment, local community, tourists, businesses and those affected by this type of tourism.",

      "description": "Nature-based tourism definitely is one of the most popular tourism forms in the world. It refers to a number of tourist activities associated with the natural environment. In this course, some of the concepts and related issues, such as distinctions between nature-based tourism and other forms of tourism, benefits and challenges of nature-based tourism, management of natural and ecological resources, park design and management, interpretation, sustainability, participation of local communities and nature based tourism products, will be explored. In order to enhance the learning experience, an interactive teaching mode will be adopted in the lectures so that the instructors can guide students to analyze the cases and issues through queries and answers. Furthermore, field trips will also be organized in which students can articulate what they learn from the class teaching. This course attempts to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to nature-based tourism, with the following specific objectives: - To examine the key concepts, theories and techniques in the management of natural and ecological resources;  - To analyze the importance of natural and ecological resources for development of nature based tourism; and - To help students develop critical thinking on the planning and management of natural environment and nature based tourism.",

Various forms of tourist activities contribute to the operations, structures and interactions within and between cities, as well as the stakeholders therein. This course is designed to allow students to investigate, study and understand the context of urban tourism. With increasing challenges caused by globalization, urbanization, tourist arrival, and the demand of additional infrastructure and resources, tourism will have to assume a new dimension in the urban context.This course attempts to explain the inter-relationships between tourism and urban environment by identifying the nature of the tourism industry in the urban areas. The course examines topical issues related to the process of development of urban tourism, its varied forms of activities, and the relevant contemporary issues relating to the management and marketing of urban destinations. By completing the course, students will be able to understand, apply and challenge concepts, theories and knowledge in urban tourism.

      "description": "The importance of field studies for tourism students is immeasurable. It forms a major complimentary aspect of the programme and is designed to give the students an opportunity to understand the real-world situation. The aim of the course is to enable students to take part in field studies away from Hong Kong where they will get involved a “local” field project that gives a stimulating, realistic and practical experience that will add value to the educational experience. The field studies programme will be undertaken in a local environment that will allow the students to take active part, identify and put theories into practice by collecting data, analyzing and interpreting the information for strategic planning and location analysis of the tourism industry.While this will provide the opportunity for individual development of the students, it will also provide an opportunity for students to work as a team in project management and problem-solving. Students are required to participate in all activities throughout the field studies, do presentations and submit reports on completion.",
