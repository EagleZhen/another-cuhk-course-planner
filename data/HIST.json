It shows how the medieval West inherited and built on the achievements of the ancient Greeks and Romans, becoming part of a wide, cosmopolitan world with well-established connections to Africa and Asia. Each week's lecture will explore a specific period and theme, after which students will have the chance to read samples of academic scholarship by experts on each topic and discuss related issues in conversation with classmates in tutorial sessions. By the end of the course, students will have a firm grasp of the basics of the medieval world and understand how the Western Middle Ages fit into the broader history of Eurasia in this period.",

It will begin with the emergence of Europe on the world stage during the sixteenth century with its Age of Exploration and its expansion into the Americas. It will then proceed through the main dynamics of world history both within The West and in its interactions with the peoples of the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa-through subsequent waves of colonization, the rise of industrialization, the World Wars, the Cold War, and the decolonization that took place during the 1950s and 1960s, through to the end of the Cold War and the emergence of the modern world order.",

Nonetheless, while war has been a constant fact of life for human society, the methods of war have changed greatly over time. Wars have also driven immense changes in human society itself, often far beyond the original intentions of political and military leaders. This dynamic has had a powerful effect on the history of the Western world, shaping the development of Western states as we know them today.This course will introduce students to the military history of the medieval West (c. AD 500-1500), focusing on Europe and surrounding regions of North Africa and Western Asia. Through weekly lectures, readings, and discussions, you will learn about key developments in military technology and tactics, as well as the decisive wars and battles in which they were put to the test.",

Given the principal position of Song dynasty in Chinese history, it is of particular importance to explore Song culture and society, as well as their influence and interaction with the foreign dynasties in northern China. Chinese culture in the future does not necessarily follows the Song pattern. Nonetheless, Song culture and society still deserves the keen attention of modern Chinese.",

Master Lu's Annals of Spring and Autumn mentions how antiquity and contemporiness are connected to each other in essence. This course attempts to provide a platform for students to comprehend the thoughts of past people. Thereby they can understand the value and meaning of studying intellectual history.",

During this \"Long Century\" Europe acquired unparalleled wealth, power, and influence. In spite of this expansion many Europeans endured a daily slog for their existence; the struggles of the proletariat will receive the same sort of consideration as the decaying aristocracies and the ascending middle-classes.

This period gave full vent to the forces of industrialization, capitalism, nationalism, imperialism, and communism while it provided the conditions for artistic innovation, philosophical competition, and scientific advancement. During these 200 years, as a continent Europe achieved its height in military, cultural, and commercial power; it then engaged in a period of violent self-destruction; finally, after profound ideological and territorial division, it reinvented itself. How the scope and volatility of the changes brought about during this time manifested themselves in the lives of ordinary men, women, and children, as well as in the affairs among nations, will receive due attention. Readings for the course will hear from many scholarly voices and will engage with a variety of primary sources that should be viewed as historical texts that open windows onto inquiries into the nature of class, gender, minority status, religion, technology, and culture.",

It therefore deserves a place in any historical curriculum.It shows both the power of ideas to shape events and the ability of events to transcend the ideas that originally inspired them. The Revolution also reshaped European politics outside of France, through the series of wars that took place both during the Revolution and during the subsequent Napoleonic era.",

      "description": "HIST3375 offers an examination of the evolution of Philippine society from the onset of Spanish colonization in the mid-1500s to the start of World War Two in Asia (in 1941). Granting an opportunity to grasp the development of the Philippines under Spanish, American, and Japanese colonial rule, the course places attention upon the nation’s capital city, Manila, a place where life has also been historically shaped by Chinese, Japanese, Western, and native cultural influences. Focusing on elements of cultural, political, and urban history the course endeavours to explain how ‘the Philippine nation’ has historically unfolded, and why Manila, today a metropolis with a population in excess of 13 million people, has come to play such a dominant role in determining the nature of Philippine society prior to the country being granted independence in 1946. Utilizing innovative teaching methods to enable students to critically understand the physical as well as cultural character of the city, and so the nation at large, a multidisciplinary approach is fostered so as to encourage learners to recognize and explain factors that have influenced Philippines civilization as it progressed from the “traditional” to the “modern”. Encouraging learners too to identify connections between the country and places elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, ultimately the course places the evolution of life in the Philippine Archipelago within the greater Asia-Pacific region. Accordingly, the curriculum is cut into two distinct sections: The Philippines pre-1898; and, the Philippines post-1898. Where possible a comparative analysis with the colonial development of Hong Kong will be provided so as to demonstrate, and explain, the different types and natures of colonial rule, culture, and development that took place in East Asia prior to the end of World War Two.",

In particular, the course examines how monuments/heritage sites, alongside museums, etc., function as gatekeepers of historical knowledge and as channels of social memory. The course, thus, breaks down dynamics (both local and global) that contribute to public debate about the past. In amalgamating knowledge of representations of the past with the development of skills in historical methodology, theory, and practice, students can expand cognisance as to how public history is represented, constructed, debated and, at times, contested. By possessing new critical awareness and skills students will be better able to sense and value the variety of roles played by historians in public settings, and the significance and impact too of public history upon culture, politics, and society at large.",

The course places emphasis on social, political and economic aspects of ancient China and major social transitions reflected in material cultures in order to complement the missing of textual records. We will examine a variety of themes through the lens of material culture engaged with primary and secondary textual sources. We cover the period between the transition of Neolithic and early domestication until the end of the Qin Empire. The main focus is on understanding how we can reconstruct various aspects of ancient China through the analysis and interpretation of material culture.Important themes covered in the class include the origin and foundation of early civilization, the formation of early state, urbanism, divination and state-sponsored ritual, trade and core-periphery relations, craft industry and technological change, the emergence of state bureaucracies, and the process of political unification. The course will provide students a basic understanding of these topics in the contexts of early China as understand through the material culture of ancient Chinese societies in juxtaposition with early textual sources including oracle bone inscription and bronze inscriptions. Weekly tutorial sections will focus on the implications and significance of these themes.",

      "description": "The module intends to provide a survey of the origins and transformations of industrial society over the last two centuries or so, a period of time within which industrial nation states have reached new heights of power and acquired the dominant share of the world’s wealth – a wealth once dominated by Westerners but increasingly challenged in recent years by the rise of, for example, South East Asian nations. This comparative studies programme shall allow students to obtain a critical understanding of the nature of industrial society through fostering a multidisciplinary approach to industrialisation and many of the changes in society it helped to establish. The course will give students the opportunity to consider the ideas and the conditions in Europe and elsewhere that produced industrial change, capitalism and democracy – processes that the West considered then and still considers today as desirable for itself and other parts of the world. The curriculum gives particular focus to pre-industrial Europe and its economy, industrial Britain, urbanisation and its effects upon social classes, public health, housing and ways of living. The course is designed to build skills such as thinking critically, well-constructed writing and the clear presenting of oral arguments. In so doing students will be expected to critically engage with a range of academic disciplines such as History (social and economic, cultural and urban), Social Studies, Economics and Geography, so as to answer questions such as:• In what ways did industrialisation fundamentally change societies?• What factors accounted for the beginning of the Industrial Revolution?• How did patterns of urbanisation change as a consequence of industrial growth?• How did social class relations shift due to industrial progress?• How did industrial changes affect the role of women or children in the work place?• What demographic changes have occurred since industrialisation began?• Were the First and Second Industrial Revolutions the same or were they different?• How did rural developments affect the rise of industry in Europe’s past?• What is the relationship between cities and the countryside both before and after the onset of industrial growth?• What dangers arise from industrial and urban transition? Are these dangers universal?",

Thus whenever a subject is offered, students will be given the evidence, so that knowledge about the subject should be based on a conscious reflection upon available evidence and logical reasoning. In addition to knowledge of ancient Egyptian civilization, students will also learn how the study of humanity can be conducted from a historical perspective.",

      "description": "The 'Middle East' is a geographical concept developed by officials in the British Empire in the 19th century to describe the lands between Europe and their distant colonies in India and East Asia. In the 21st century, we often associate the Middle East with the Muslim religion and Arab culture, but it is a vast region spanning from Morocco to India and home to countless peoples and faiths. It is the birthplace not just of Islam but also of Christianity, Judaism, and other religions, while its peoples speak not just Arabic but also Farsi, Turkish, French, and more. At its extremities, the Middle East connects China, Europe, and Africa.This course provides a broad survey of Middle Eastern history from the last days of the ancient Roman and Persian Empires in the 6th century to the emergence of modern Middle Eastern nationalisms in the 19th. It looks at the most important themes of change and continuity in the region, examining the important historical dynamics that have made the Middle East what it is today. The course also situates its subject matter in the wider context of world history, exploring how the Middle East has affected, and been affected by, events in Europe, Africa, Asia, and even the Americas.",

We will discuss the agency of women not merely as passive observers but at times as contributors to shape history. We will read scholarly materials and examine primary sources of memoirs, autobiographies, biographies, and oral history accounts. We will focus not only on those who are known in history, but also on ordinary individuals whose lives were affected, changed, destroyed, interrupted, empowered, and inspired by the forces of history. We will examine both the powerful and the powerless, and the power of the powerless to affect their own destiny. The course will employ a flipped classroom approach with an aim to cultivate community, collaboration, and creativity. Students are also encouraged to contribute to the documentation of women in social and political condition at different periods of history.",

This course is divided into two parts. The first part, from a macro perspective, discusses the history of the Chinese overseas migration through an analysis of the business and migration environment and the social and economic foundations of the South China communities from the Ming Qing to the Republican period. The second part, from a micro perspective, examines selected emigrants communities, their social and cultural changes in relation to their overseas connections. Lectures in the classroom will be supplemented by participant observations in the field and subsequent discussion sessions.",

The victory of the Communists in China's civil war in 1949 and the relocation of the Kuomintang Government to Taipei sparked off the dispute over Taiwan's status, which endures to the present day. Now President Chen Shui-bian wants to redefine Taiwan's status as a sovereign, independent country whose name is the Republic of China, while Beijing defines Taiwan as part of China. This course will examine the stand taken on Taiwan by key international actors, in particular the United States, but including Japan and the European Union. It will look at the Taiwan Straits military crises of the 1950s and the role of the United States, the initial strong international support for the KMT government as the sole legal government of all China until the tide turned in 1971, with Beijing replacing Taipei in the United Nations. It will also examine various international documents that have a bearing on the international status of Taiwan as well as statements issued by the government in Taiwan and leading political parties there as well as white papers on Taiwan issued by the People's Republic of China.",

The course is divided into two parts: the first part, from a macro perspective, discusses the “position” of festivals and popular religion in the Chinese Imperial State and local society. We will try to discuss (1) how did the Ming Qing Government sanction and control local ritual activities? (2) How did different social groups depict festivals and popular religion in different periods of time? And (3) How did local society utilize the State language to enhance, adjust, reconstruct and forget local traditions? The second part, through case studies, will investigate local social activities’ organizational method and its changes in order to understand the interactive relationship between tradition and modernization. It also attempts to explore the relationship between historical narration and interpretation from analyses of these case studies.",

It also introduces the archives of the British colonial governance in Hong Kong and discusses how to use the archives in the research of Hong Kong History. Since the nineteenth century, Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao have developed a close connection in terms of politics, economy, society and culture; therefore, this course not only focuses on the archives in Hong Kong, but also introduces the collections of archives in Guangdong and Macao.",

This era saw great changes of social and political theory: a ritual life that had reached from emperor into villages came to be articulated in relation to a central government and its cities. The rural population ceased to be central to ritual life and came to be marginalized. Orthodox values came to be looked upon as superstition. Meanwhile, a social ethos came to represent the fashion of a new age, and city life was looked upon as a symbol of progress. This transition from old to new repositioned the individual, family, nation, and even language and gender. This transition has continued to the present day, making us as much its creator as well as its product. This course seeks to raise questions about the society which we take for granted and in which we are now placed has evolved from the late Qing.",

To understand how Chinese society became a unity, it is necessary to trace the processes by which multiple rituals and customs converged so that they integrated with dynastic traditions. Those processes included the expansion of the imperial state from the Song dynasty to the Republic as well as the reactions of local societies to it. By combining field work and documentary analysis, this course sensitizes students to a history from below in which indigenous communities utilizes state rituals to express their own concerns and identities.",

      "description": "This module provides an introductory survey of the history of urban development from the ancient period to the end of the twentieth century. It focuses on the forces that have led to the development of cities in the past, and achieves this through the lens of a multi-disciplinary perspective and the utilisation of various methodologies. Such a standpoint is adopted in order to allow for the exploration of the impacts of matters like politics, economics, culture and identity, art and architecture, intellectual thought, law, transportation, and military technology upon urban society at different times in history, and to recognise how they influenced the design and shape of the built environment, and so city living. Central to the programme is the use of comparative analyses which assist in identifying and contrasting patterns of urban change. As such differences in urban design that became evident in the past will be made clear. Furthermore such an approach helps illuminate and clarify the imprint upon urban space and the urban mind of agents affecting the urban development process, including visions and concepts (built and unbuilt) that have swayed social development. Importantly too in utilising this analytical perspective students are granted opportunities to test hypotheses under the guidance of their teacher about the causes and effects of urban transition, in so doing helping explicitly comprehend the narrative of historical urban development in both factual and conceptual terms.",

      "description": "This course examines the interactive relations between the Chinese overseas and their hometowns from the 19th century. It attempts to investigate the factors that facilitate overseas migration, the changing perceptions of the Chinese overseas on their hometowns, their contributions towards the promotion or restriction of local modernization and the emigrant communities’ “overseas connections” as cultural capital in the shaping of local politics as well as social and economic lives. This course is divided into two parts. The first part, from a macro perspective, discusses the history of the Chinese overseas migration through an analysis of the business and migration environment and the social and economic foundations of the South China communities from the Ming Qing to the Republican period. The second part, from a micro perspective, examines selected emigrants communities, their social and cultural changes in relation to their overseas connections.",
