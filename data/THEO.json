      "description": "This course aims to develop practical research and academic writing skills of students. They are required to choose a subject for a paper, to create a logical structure, and to construct their own arguments academically. Their papers will be presented at the seminars. Chosen topics of the paper should be related to theological areas such as systematic theology, biblical studies, church history, practical theology, gender theology and so on. Nevertheless, students are encouraged to discuss current issues and subjects of other disciplines relating to the modern world from a theological perspective. Students’ performances will be primarily assessed by their written papers and presentations, but also by their participation in the discussion session. They will be evaluated on their ability to think theologically, that is, to reflect upon major theological and social issues, to define current issues in theological terms, and theological issues from the perspective of other disciplines.",

      "description": "Graham Ward, Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford, once remarked, \"theology’s business has always been the transgression of boundaries. It is a discourse which requires other discourses for its very possibility.\" In this light, theological study is inherently interdisciplinary. Also, theologians are increasingly getting involved in praxis, which calls for them to have the expertise to critically examine the social, cultural, and political dimensions of everyday life. This course addresses these two aspects of theological study and focuses on the various ways theology can engage with contemporary critical theories in order to theologically analyze a society along the three media of speech, money, and power, as described by Jürgen Habermas. The course selectively covers the following contemporary critical theories and topics: the Frankfurt School and Dialectical Thinking in the Marxist traditions; Michel Foucault's Theories of Power, Knowledge, Truth, Subjectivity, and Ethics; Postcolonialism and Decoloniality; Critical Theories of Everyday Resistance; Critical Historiography; Critical Theory; Feminism and Queer Theory. In addition to a survey of the various approaches to critical theories, selected prominent critical theorists from each approach will be discussed. The theological implications of these theories will be examined through the lens of selected social issues and phenomena. Students will be required to conduct a theologically critical analysis of selected issues in their home society by adopting one of the critical perspectives. This course weaves together analytical approaches from the two disciplines to provide a theologically critical understanding of contemporary social issues.",

      "description": "“Experience” and reflection on it have always been a concern for theologians, despite the diversity of theological traditions that prioritize various aspects of the formative factors for theology in different ways. In addition, contemporary theologians and church leaders share a growing concern for praxis that transforms the world and the church. All of this necessitates that theologians comprehend experience not only on a philosophical and conceptual level, but also as inherently concrete and social. Consequently, theologians are becoming increasingly interested in distinctive categories of empirical data pertinent to theology and in distinctive research methodologies pertinent to the analysis of these data. This is especially true of practical theologians and empirical theologians, though it is not exclusive to them. In this light, as stated by the editors of the Eerdmans series of Studies in Ecclesiology and Ethnography, if theology is to have impact on the church and world today, theologians must learn to utilize empirical research tools to provide more accurate, disciplined, and contextually-grounded research.This course thus exposes students to a variety of empirical research methods and data analytic tools that will help them understand, evaluate, and conduct empirical research relevant to theological studies. The primary emphasis will be on qualitative approaches, but students will also learn how to read quantitative research reports critically. It aims to provide students with a foundation for integrating theological inquiry and empirical research in a manner that not only maintains the integrity of both disciplines but also employs social scientific methods in a manner that is \"theological all the way through,\" as Helen Cameron has stated. Students will be required to conduct a mini-study on selected issues in their home society/church by adopting one of the empirical research methods.",

      "description": "The absence of women’s experiences and voices often seems the result and perpetuation of a blindness to gender inequality within the Church. To change this reality, we must return to a basic question: What does Christian theology reveal to the Church about the nature and place of women? The course aims at exposing students to a broad perspective and discussion about the dynamic relationship between theology and feminism. In addition to introducing the experiences of contemporary women and feminist critiques on violence, family, sexuality, poverty, ecology and media, the students will be encouraged to reexamine the ways in which the Western Judeo-Christian religious tradition has profoundly influenced our understanding of God and gender and to study the feminist interpretations of God-talks, sin and redemption, spirituality, leadership and church.",

      "description": "This course considers the various religious and theological dimensions of contemporary cinema, and examines a range of approaches to such endeavours. Since the inception of motion picture in 1895, cinema and institutional religions (including Christianity) have always been interested in each other – numerous films have used religious themes and motifs as subject matters, while religious communities have been eager to harness the cinema by critiquing, censoring, or making use of films in their ministries. The study of film from serious academic theological perspectives, however, was scarce until the mid 1990s. In this course, we explore a number of approaches by which the theological study of film can take place. These include, for example, the study of explicit representation of religious materials, the 'uncovering' of implicit religious motifs, the use of film as resource for theological reflection and construction. In particular, we shall consider how cinematic representations of certain important theological motifs may enrich conventional religious understanding. Films to be viewed and discussed cover a broad range from European art-house classics, popular Hollywood productions, to contemporary East Asian and Chinese language films.",

While popular culture and the media have long become a daily reality for many in the world, these have seldom been taken seriously by theologians and scholars of religion. Also, the relationship between popular media and religion (including Christianity) is often overlooked in academic studies until relatively recent time. We shall re-examine various manifestations of popular culture from Christian theological perspectives, and also probes into the subtle interrelatedness between media culture and Christianity as an organised religion. As its wider academic context, this course engages with the interdisciplinary field of media, religion, and culture (MRC) which has been under vigorous development since the mid-1990s; as its immediate socio-cultural-religious context of discussions, it attends particularly to the Chinese language popular media and Chinese Christianity in Hong Kong.",

It helps students to see how different sub-disciplines of theology can be critically integrated into a coordinated whole and in this way be relevant to the practical life in one's own context. Social and theological analysis are given equal emphasis, and how these two could be mutually and critically correlated will be demonstrated. Experts or/and experienced practitioners in different fields of practice will be invited to share with students their analyses of the respective public/current issues, while theological responses (philosophical, exegetical, historical, and practical) will be given by teachers from different sub-disciplines in theology. Around half of the lectures will be structured in the form of an interdisciplinary dialogue.",
