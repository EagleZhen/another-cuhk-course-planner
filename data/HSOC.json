To be effective, public health nutritionists must first connect the principles of nutritional science to the realm of public health practice in ways that emphasize the multi-factorial origins of actual nutritional problems in modern societies. In this course, students will be introduced to various essential elements of food and nutritional sciences. The current nutrition issues at both local and global levels will be discussed. The application of these on promoting nutrition health of the population will be illustrated.",
