Educational innovation improves teaching and learning, enhances wellbeing, ensures successful transitions and pathways, as well as alleviates inequity. This course will start with an introduction on the role of education in economic development followed by discussion on various forms of educational innovation in schooling systems including alternative schools. Case studies on innovative educational practice in different countries will be examined. Students will be asked to identify educational challenges that learners and teachers are grappling with. Guest lectures are offered by leaders of local or international social enterprises and foundations that practice and support educational innovations. Students will be invited to brainstorm and join social enterprises’ efforts to provide sustainable strategies to tackle development issues especially to that of educational equality. Evaluation on how educational innovations promote student learning will also be explored. At the end of the course, students will develop a proposal that advances current educational practices in our society reflecting community needs and addressing the social inequality and poverty issues.",

      "description": "This is a two-semester course for final year students of the programme. Under the guidance of project supervisors, students are required to complete an individual project pertaining to the applications of learning, design, and technology in education, workplace, or other organizational settings. They should draw on theoretically-informed and empirically-validated learning design frameworks to design innovative and authentic technology-enriched learning experiences for the participants so that the curricular goals are attained. They should propose a project in the field of Learning Design and Technology and execute that project from analysis to evaluation.",

Students are expected to conduct a study on their own that leads to the writing of a research report under the guidance of project supervisors. They should meet their supervisors for reporting the project progress and seeking advice regularly. They are also encouraged to make appointments with their supervisors to discuss any problems encountered during each phase of their studies if needed.",
