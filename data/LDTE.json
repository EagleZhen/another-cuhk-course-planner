Educational innovation improves teaching and learning, enhances wellbeing, ensures successful transitions and pathways, as well as alleviates inequity. This course will start with an introduction on the role of education in economic development followed by discussion on various forms of educational innovation in schooling systems including alternative schools. Case studies on innovative educational practice in different countries will be examined. Students will be asked to identify educational challenges that learners and teachers are grappling with. Guest lectures are offered by leaders of local or international social enterprises and foundations that practice and support educational innovations. Students will be invited to brainstorm and join social enterprises’ efforts to provide sustainable strategies to tackle development issues especially to that of educational equality. Evaluation on how educational innovations promote student learning will also be explored. At the end of the course, students will develop a proposal that advances current educational practices in our society reflecting community needs and addressing the social inequality and poverty issues.",

While digital and technological innovation accelerates economic growth and plays a critical role for reducing poverty, it also trigger social inequality issues. Further, technological changes (such as computerization, artificial intelligence, etc.) will fundamentally alter the nature of professions and of high skilled jobs generally. The course starts with an overview of the current educational attainment and schooling investments across the world. This is followed by exploring the demand for human capital and educational investments aligned with economic development, public financing of education. Students will also be able to examine interactions between education, technology and development from social and economic perspectives on other issues, including compulsory education reform, manpower planning and curriculum reform, automation and its impact on jobs and labor market, gender gap in schooling and STEM subjects, welfare policy reforms and its impact on children.",
