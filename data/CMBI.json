Students will therefore not only learn various modern techniques, but also how and when these techniques are applied in life science research. In addition to the transgenic plant cell lines established in CMBI3010, this course will introduce students to transient expressions in animal cell models. Cell imaging approach employing high-end methodologies in microscopy to detect the expression and sub-cellular localization of fluorescent proteins as well as organelle dynamics will be used.

Specific topics include the structures and functions of transport vesicles, receptor-mediated protein transport, protein compartmentation in the secretory and endocytic pathways as well as in other organelles, protein degradation and the biological consequences of protein mis-localization in organisms. Students are required to watch online Lecture Videos in KEEP or Blackboard about Basic Knowledge in protein trafficking prior to the Lectures. These online Lecture Videos are supplemented with online quizzes in which students need to finish after watching these videos. In addition, students will also watch videos discussing recent Research Papers. During lectures, students will have in-depth discussion regarding the questions, key concepts and up-to-date research. By these means students will be able to clarify their concepts and be familiar with the latest research findings that are related to protein trafficking. Students will also learn the current developments of protein trafficking in details by delivering a presentation on a relevant topic derived from a recent research paper, with a Q&A session. The presentation will be graded by both Professor and peer students.Blended-mode class section is available for this course.

The students are challenged with open-end questions on how to address key questions on energetic factors that contribute to protein stability. Through intensive in-class discussions and quizzes, the students will learn how hypotheses on protein folding are supported or disproved by experimental evidence. Examples also include those published by scientists in Hong Kong so that the students have a more personal touch on how scientists innovate and design their researches.  \n   \nStage 2: Learn how to apply the theories learnt to improve protein stability in a group project.  \n   \nThe students are divided into small groups and work together on a group project to study how to improve protein stability using the theory of protein folding energetic learnt. They will survey the latest research literatures on the field and are asked to give critical assessment on how protein stability can be improved and present their views and findings in an oral presentation.",
