This will reshape the socio-economic relations and the urban landscapes of the three places. Studying the changing relations of Hong Kong, Macao and the PRD will not only help students understand the dynamic socio-economic development of the Greater Bay Area as a rapidly growing mega-city region in the world, but also capture the latest transformation of the region.

Drawing on the interdisciplinary nature of Women’s and Gender Studies, the course will guide students to examine how gender works as one of the primary social organizing principles in the movies we watch, the housework we do, the behaviors we express and many other daily activities that have been routinized. The first three lectures will equip students with a critical gender lens by questioning biology and getting familiar with theories of gender role, socialization, gender schema, doing gender and queer theory. All concepts to be explored in class will be explained with reference to research. At the end of the course, students will come to understand how political their personal life is. In particular, the course hopes to inspire students to take part in creating social change for gender equality, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",

This course examines the development and academic significance of various forms of Japanese popular culture such as films, comics, music, TV dramas and culinary culture, from multidisciplinary perspectives, including history, cultural anthropology, cultural studies and media studies. It aims to deepen understanding the following three facets of Japanese popular culture:1) the applicaton of cultural globalization theory in Japan; 2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries; and 3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society. Using concrete examples and grounding on representative academic writings, this course discusses the globalization of Japanese popular culture and relevant issues in indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows and media-mix. Students are trained to understand the nature and cultural implications of Japanese popular culture in an Asian context. Besides lectures, discussions and readings, this course selectively utilizes topical essays (projects), e-learning, audio-visual materials and fieldwork-based assignments as supplementary teaching tools.",

How does tourism contribute to the sustainable development of human society? What are the impacts of tourism upon the cities and communities? Using Japan as a principal example, this course aims at examining the possibilities and challenges of achieving sustainable development goals through tourism. The first part of this course introduces basic concepts of tourism and sustainable development goals, and discusses their relationship. The second part of the course compares Japan to China and other countries, and investigates the benefits and costs of tourism in relation to sustainable cities and communities, indigenous culture, and natural resources. Additional discussions further explore the potentials of sustainable tourism in Hong Kong. With assigned readings and coursework, students are expected to acquire knowledge on sustainable development goals, and critically evaluate tourism as a means to achieve these goals.",

This is an introductory course that surveys key issues in Chinese politics, including the historical background of the system, the roles of the party/state, the style of leadership, the forms of popular participation, and the distinctive features of Chinese politics. The focus of this course is political change. Classic essays by Sun Yatsen, Lu Xun, Mao Zedong and others provide students with grounding in the key problems modern China has faced, as well as the solutions it has pioneered. From that foundation, we will move on to contemporary institutions and intellectual debates over inequality, human rights, and the future shape of political reform in China.",

By taking an interdisciplinary approach to the topic, we will study food, film, television, music, fashion and sports and ask how they participate in the transnational production, distribution and circulation of culture, identity, modernity, tradition, ideology and politics both regionally and globally. One of the major questions this course will explore is the curious ways in which these popular media continuously re-stage and re-define Korea’s historical past in order to comment on its present. This course also targets to equip students with analytical tools to critically think about popular culture as well as understand theories of cultural globalization.",

The selected movie texts in this course would serve two purposes: learning tools and learning objects. On the one hand, students will analyze the features and real-life impacts of global issues depicted from these movies. On the other hand, they will also be trained to exercise critical thoughts towards the narratives conveyed from these movies.

It introduces basic concepts and major issues in the areas where the study of gender and the study of kinship intersect through an anthropological lens. Issues to be explored include kinship structures and related gender roles in cross-cultural perspective, the changing relationship between marriage and love, and the various new ways of people “doing” kinship in contemporary societies and the emerging social problems resulted from these changes. Themes such as kinship and the new reproductive technologies, fictive kinship and human-pet bond will all be discussed.",

Underlying most topics are questions of the modern versus the traditional, rural versus urban, cosmopolitan versus parochial, and how all these opposites interact to construct culture in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has been developed at a rapid pace since WWII. This course also discusses to what extent the development in Hong Kong meets the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular in the area of gender equality, cultural inclusiveness, and socially responsible production and consumption.",

      "description": "The course introduces students to interdisciplinary studies on urban walks, urban encounters, cultural responses to urban walking experiences and creative interventions reacting to the urban built environment. Since the second half of the 19th century, ways of encountering the city at the street level and various means for capturing and making sense of urban encounters have continuously evolved, the course’s first aim is to introduce to students the history and shifting paradigms for understanding urban experiences in relation to walking. Secondly, the Covid-19 pandemic has substantively revived global interests in urban walks, the second aim of the course is to examine the latest ideas concerning rediscovering the city through different modes of walks. Thirdly, students will learn connecting theories to practices, they will learn to become active “users” of the city and adopt different forms to create new walking experiences and articulate urban experiences.More specifically, the course will focus on how ‘walking in the city’ has become an activity in its own right, and the cultural and social potentials of ‘non-functional’ urban walks. Wandering in the city has its own evolving knowledge and practices, the academic discussion accumulated through the years will be introduced. As such, through urban walks one can encounter the heterogeneity and complexity of cities including but not limited to its built environment, symbolic dimension, flows, natural elements and publicness. The heterogeneity and complexity of the city will be primarily addressed, especially through various schools of thought which have influenced how urban walks have been undertaken. The Sustainable Development Goal 3 ‘Good-Health and Wellbeing’ & Goal 11 ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’ will be covered by the course, as urban walks have been seen as key to achieving wellbeing in recent years and it is also a means for the community to enhance their bonding by sharing local knowledge through walks. Goal 4 ‘Quality Education’ is also covered as walking is increasingly seen as a medium for innovative education and a form of life-long learning outside of the classroom.",

      "description": "Surprisingly, as one of the world’s most modern cities, often thought of as a city of skyscrapers, Hong Kong has an incredibly rich and diverse cultural heritage. This is reflected in its wide diversity of buildings and monuments; including ancient temples, walled villages, and legacies of its colonial period including Tai Kwun, Heritage 1881, and more recent glass and steel structures such as Norman Foster’s HSBC Building. Hong Kong also has many museums and galleries containing important representations of Chinese and other cultures which were important in the development of modern Hong Kong. These range from works of art, through to the seemingly more mundane legacy of Hong Kong’s colonial history, and evidence its pre and post-colonial heritage. This course considers the issues which face this heritage, and the legal framework and other protection affecting cultural heritage in Hong Kong. Among other topics, the course will consider: the law and policy intended to safeguard built heritage in Hong Kong; the law and policy affecting antiquities and other forms of portable heritage including private and public collections in Hong Kong; the law and policy affecting street art and public expressions of Chinese culture; the history of looted heritage including Hong Kong’s looted heritage and Hong Kong’s role in the illicit trafficking of looted heritage from China, and the law which is intended to prevent this illicit trade; the law and policy intended to safeguard Hong Kong’s water heritage including shipwrecks, and treasure hunting; and, the law and policy intended to safeguard the newest and richest recognised form of cultural heritage- intangible cultural heritage, including Cantonese opera, dragon-boat racing, bamboo scaffolding, neon signs and milk tea.This course will consider the threats that Hong Kong’s cultural heritage faces and the law and other safeguarding measures that have been implemented and may be introduced to promote Sustainable Development Goals including, among others, Life on Land (SDG 15), Life Below water (SDG 14), Climate Action (SDG 13), and Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11).",

For example, aging or overpopulation in urban cities, environmental degradation, food and water resource crisis, large-scale voluntary and involuntary migration, and spread of communicable disease. A key goal of the course is to map out the linkages between population patterns, trends, and some of the socio-economic issues that occur locally, nationally, and at the global level which bring great challenges to our society. You will learn the concepts, theories, and data essential in the scientific study of the size, composition, and spatial distribution of human populations; and the changes that occur in these phenomena through the processes of fertility, mortality, and migration. You will gain an understanding of the roots of population structures, processes, and the consequences for individuals, family, and societies, and how it will affect and be affected by natural resources availability or depletion and health care system. Students will acquire the basic ability to analyze, explain and present the potential crisis facing the population system. In particular, this course will stimulate students’ interest in understanding how the population could be linked to sustainable development, and reflect on the relationship between population growth and availability of resources, as well as the relationship between population and social institutional arrangements such as child and old care support, job supply and public asset distribution. In the end, students will learn to apply their skill and knowledge in proposing solutions for solving population-related challenges for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for example, zero hunger and no poverty, good health and well-being, reducing social inequality including gender inequality, maintaining decent work and economic development while developing more sustainable cities and communities.",

      "description": "This course is designed to offer an exhaustive and nuanced exploration of the intricate patterns and rich historical tapestries of urban development worldwide, viewed through a geographic lens. Throughout this course, students will be introduced to a wide range of theories and concepts that are intricately linked to the social and economic evolution of cities across different world regions. These theories and concepts include colonialism, postcolonialism, capitalism, neoliberalism, globalization, post-industrial development, urbanization, and urban sprawl. By exploring these theories and concepts, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of urban development within diverse geographic contexts and with varying historical backgrounds. This course is relevant to SDGs 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). It will provide students with the knowledge and tools to identify inequalities in urban development and analyze the challenges and opportunities in achieving sustainable cities and communities. The curriculum is thoughtfully divided into five key sections, each providing an in-depth analysis of urban development in different regions – Europe, America, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Greater Middle East, and Asia. These sections are carefully curated to help students gain a profound understanding of the diverse economic, political, cultural, and historical influences that have shaped and continue to shape urban landscapes in these varied regions. Students will engage with diverse learning methodologies. This includes detailed case studies that provide real-world examples of urban development, scholarly readings that offer academic perspectives, visual aids that illustrate key concepts, and interactive discussions that encourage critical thinking and collaborative learning. Ideal for students with a passion for urban studies, geography, history, sociology, or related disciplines, this course offers a unique opportunity to explore the world of urban development in a global context, preparing them to become informed and engaged global citizens.",

      "terms": [],
      "description": "The universal appeal of classical music is masked by a troubled past. It is a complex story of white colonization by European powers, spanning centuries and continents. Classical music has its own colonial baggage, too, with links to slavery profits and other problematic phenomena, whether in the gendered tradition of the “great composers,” or in a thriving piano industry of the early 20th century, which resulted in forced labor and countless deaths in the colonial ivory trade, or in the transnational circulation of opera in and beyond the 19th century, which would not have been possible without the port city networks of rapidly expanding empires. Importantly, such legacies have led to new forms of advocacy aimed at decolonizing classical music today. This SDG-GE course will examine how current practices around the world, on the back of complex and violent histories, attempt to democratize classical music in lockstep with the needs and concerns of contemporary society. What does it mean to decolonize musically in the 21st century, recenter marginalized individuals and groups in classical music, and make classical music more sustainable and reflective of a fair society? These questions run through the three themed sections of the syllabus: i) gender and representation, ii) equality, diversity, inclusion, iii) institutions and justice. We will explore related ideas and concepts, in connection with past contexts and present practices, including orchestras, opera companies, community projects, and social enterprises. By drawing on a variety of perspectives, we will discuss how and why decolonizing classical music matters, to whom, along with its ongoing challenges for improving and enhancing equity.  This course engages directly with SDGs 5, 10, and 16. Through the three themed sections, we will assess how classical music practices today can be observed to respond to the identified SDGs, particularly in terms of further empowering indigenous women musicians, reducing age-old inequalities, and promoting greater social justice from within institutions that can better reflect the untold tales and human experiences of classical music.  Neither score-reading nor prior musical knowledge is required for this course.",

This approach to development should not only generate economic growth, but also distribute its benefits equitably, regenerate the environment rather than destroy it, as well as empower people rather than marginalize them. The UN 2030 Agenda came into effect in 2015 promising to “interlink and integrate” Sustainable Development Goals in an attempt to implement solutions facing humanity. Sustainable development goals are an all-inclusive invitation to act to end poverty, secure the planet and ensure that all people appreciate peace and prosperity.This course introduces the concept of sustainable development, the evolution of models and the implicit assumptions they make, as well as their contradictions. It also traces the advent of the SDGs and the extent that they support the principles of sustainable development. We examine the emergence of environmental problems and critically review the institutional responses to these problems since the late 1960s. We then consider in detail the increasingly popular idea of efforts in the pursuit of the SDGs from different perspectives that centres around people, planet, prosperity, peace and the partnerships involved in achieving the goals. The lectures will explore how achieving sustainable development goals will depends much on effective planning and good governance. Examples from different parts of the world will be used to underline the tight inter-connections between processes in different regions and across geographical scales in the context of sustainable development.",

The objective of this course is to give students an overview of the status, features, and use of Hong Kong English (HKE), the variety of English commonly used in Hong Kong. In the first part of the course, students will be introduced to the concept of ‘world Englishes’ and examine different theoretical frameworks for conceptualizing the evolution of new varieties of English. The course then examines relationship between Hong Kong English and Hong Kong culture from cultural, social, historical, and educational perspectives, particularly in relation to and juxtaposition from Cantonese and Putonghua. The second part of the course examines both spoken and written features of HKE, including grammar, discourse particles, vocabulary, and pronunciation, as well as the practices of code-mixing and code-switching. This section of the course also focuses on the social impact of the use of these features in Hong Kong culture. In the third part of the course, language attitudes and ideologies towards ‘standard’ language varieties (for example American and British English) in relation to HKE will be explored. The course will also examine the relationship between use of HKE and social identity as well as gender in Hong Kong culture.",

      "description": "(UGEC2189 is double-coded with ENGE2600.) Although English has long spread around the world, the consequences of this spread are only now beginning to be appreciated by speakers in diverse cultures and societies. English has changed the world, impacting specific local cultures in both positive and negative ways. But English has also been localized and acculturated, made to express the realities of diverse cultures and societies, and so the language has been changed in turn. The discourse of world Englishes aims to re-imagine our understanding of the language. The difference between error and innovation can no longer be decided by reference to ‘ownership’ of the language. Additionally, the language is beginning to be a medium of the expression of identity for more and more people in very different social and cultural contexts. World English must be pluralized, which is why we think in terms of world Englishes. This course is split into two sections. The first section will introduce you to issues in the discourse of world Englishes: innovation, variety, creativity, globalization, etc. The second section will look at specific case studies in different cultures and societies, and will focus on Asian Englishes, e.g. English in Singapore, China, and Japan. Different Asian cultures have distinct historical experiences with English, leading to different levels of cultural penetration (e.g. in popular culture) and depth of function (e.g. in business and law). The second section looks at different examples to explore their specific cultural engagements with the English language, but also to identify what they have in common: Japan English and Singlish develop in very different cultures, but the course with emphasis comparison as well as contrast.",

Hong Kong is the main focus of discussion though examples or cases in Mainland China and around the world are also provided throughout the course. Critical issues in ecotourism such as its multi-dimensional impacts, governance, planning, and resource and visitor management will also be covered. Lastly, students will be exposed to the relation of the phenomenon of ecotourism and the concept of sustainable tourism. Some of the lectures will address SDGs, for example, Goals 12, 16 and 17 embrace the knowledge and evolution of environmentalism and nature-human relationship; Goals 14 and 15 connect with the concept of protected areas and environmental conservation; Goals 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 12 and 13 cover multi-dimensional tourism impacts and, more importantly, climate change issue. The concept of sustainable development will frame and conclude the entire course since the concepts has played an indispensable role in tourism development nowadays.",

      "description": "The pursuit of ideal living environment has long been a human undertaking throughout history. Because of environmental variations, some places are definitely better than the others for living and development. In ancient time, man strived for searching a nice place for settlement where could provide a better resource base. Nowadays, man acquires sciences and technologies to change or even create the environment that makes living pleasant and comfortable. Those human settlements which develop an integrated and sustainable approach to the environmental, economic and social challenges will have more chance to grow and prosper.Ideal living environment is closely related with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG11 and SDG13 with topics covered in this course. Sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11) directly address the need for safe, inclusive, and resilient living environments. It includes targets for affordable housing, sustainable urban planning, and access to green and public spaces, resilient building. Climate Action (SDG 13) mitigates climate change impacts through sustainable practices which helps protect living environments from extreme weather events and environmental degradation. By focusing on these related SDGs, students can create their ideal living environments by promoting sustainability, enhancing quality of life and addressing climate change challenges that not only meet the needs of current communities that are inclusive, resilient and environmentally friendly, but also ensure sustainability for future generations.This course provides students with the insights needed to gain an understanding of ideal environment for living from the perspective of a geographer. Key themes include searching for the best location, the rise of city, forms of human settlement, ideal living and quality of life. As the course examines the understanding of ideal environment for living from different angles, students will not only gain objective geographical knowledge about the relationship between man and environment, but also learn how some urban challenges and issues are tackled. Ecological civilisation, landscape cities and sustainable development of ideal living environment will also be explored. While the coverage will be broad and pluralistic, examples and cases of Hong Kong, mainland China, and other parts of the world will be emphasized. In order to enhance the learning experience, an interactive teaching mode will be adopted in the lectures so that the instructor can guide students to analyse the cases and issues through discussions.",

The causes of world hunger will be analyzed with special emphasis on food production systems, bearing in mind there is no single solution to the problem. Moreover, the course delves into the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of hunger, examining how issues such as poverty, food insecurity, and climate change intersect to exacerbate the problem. Towards the end of the course, students will gain a deeper understanding of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) through an exploration of sustainable agricultural practices and strategies to address global hunger challenges in the 21st century.

      "description": "Popular representations of the African continent produced in global discussions are marked by a stereotyped image of Africa, its culture, environment and development. The purpose of this course is to critically examine the common framing of Africa as a continent of conflict, disasters, poverty and a region that is perpetually in need of external intervention. In addition to the myth that surrounds Africa, there is a growing dynamics of activities resulting into the current interest on the continent. Earlier, the UN settled on the Agenda 2030 as a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity for the whole world. This plan dovetails very well with the Africa’s Agenda 2063. This therefore provides an opportunity to identify where Africa situates on SDG issues that include its people, its environment and its economic development.The course will therefore present to students the context of Africa relating to its geography, environment, culture as well as contemporary development issues shaping the destiny of Africa. Through lectures, guest speakers, videos and possibly field studies, students will be able to critically evaluate the stereotypical notion of Africa as a continent rather than as a country as is quite often misconstrued. The course will provide an intellectual platform to understand and analyze issues from a multi-disciplinary perspective as they relate to Africa and humanity. The students will be able to interpret and explain in broad terms, the contemporary position of Africa as it relates to other parts of the world with special attention to its relationship with Asia and China in particular.",

The unprecedented pace of urbanization has recently witnessed a historic shift of human population with the majority now living in cities. The growth of cities in this age of globalization raises many opportunities and challenges, concerning the quality of life, poverty, sustainability, environmental degradation and urban competitiveness. All of which deserve our attention.This course offers students a comprehensive understanding of cities and urban challenges from the perspective of sustainable development. It examines the historical, social, economic, cultural and environmental dimensions of cities. As the course focuses on urban issues at global, regional and local levels, students will not only gain knowledge about the causes and impacts of urban problems, but also learn how different stakeholders can help achieve sustainable liveable cities in the age of globalization. By adopting an issue-based approach, different SDGs such as no poverty (SDG 1), industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), reduced inequality (SDG 10) and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), will be included in a variety of topics ranging from socio-economic to environmental aspects in the course. Different cities will be chosen as case studies for understanding various urban challenges and solutions. Apart from lectures, students will develop critical thinking on various urban challenges that affect their daily lives through video discussion, group projects and presentation in the discussion forums.",

Ecological crisis, environmental degradation, and extreme weathers have become the watchwords of contemporary politics. The conventional boundaries between “nature” and “culture” are now being questioned. How do nature, culture and power intersect in our everyday life? How do we get to understand issues of sustainability and environmental crisis from a broad historical perspective and global activism angle? How are gender, class and race interact with technology, damaged environment, animal and plant species? This course explores these questions and the rich debates in the emerging field of environmental humanity and literature of the Anthropocene.Class topics are organized on major global green movements that resisted oil pollution, toxic factories, logging companies, dam constructions and nuclear plant building. Students get to learn the historical developments of major environmental activism in the West and the global south. How was the Greenpeace founded? What is the Narmada Dam Movement in India? Do you know Ken Saro-Wiwa, an environmental activist against Shell oil pollution in Nigeria? In each class we examine historical texts, visual materials and theoretical debates to explore how environmental justice has been intertwined with histories of colonialism, neoliberalism, and questions of gender, race, poverty and class. Together the class explores the problem of the Anthropocene (Nature) in the context of colonial history, grass root struggles (Culture) and corporation greed (Power).This course addresses many of the 17 United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Climate Actions (13), Life on Land (15), Life below Water (14), Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (16), Clean Energy (7), Reduced Inequalities (10), and Gender Inequality (5).

We seldom consider, however, the powerful influence it has over our cultural identities. This course examines how the interplay between celebrity culture and the cultural industry shapes cultural identity with case studies from Hong Kong as the major scope of study. Starting with a brief history of Hong Kong celebrity culture from the 1980s to the present day, the course offers an entry point for students to understand the intricate relationship between the media and celebrity culture, encompassing a wide range of cultural icons and phenomena such as action film actors, cross-media megastars, and YouTube micro-celebrities. Each case study will engage with key concepts in celebrity culture, such as star-text, commodification, authenticity, extratextual reading, and participatory reading. The course proceeds by introducing the critical perspective of cultural studies in making sense of representation politics, public culture, fandom studies, and the diverse modes of intimacy in the digital age. Overall, students will gain an understanding of celebrity culture and how identities are thus produced, promoted, and commodified in the wider arena of media and popular culture.",

The capacity symbolizes the balance between population size and environmental resources ––the underlying foundation for sustainable development. In history, it is shown that the human carrying capacity was periodically shrunk by climate deterioration and human-induced environmental degradation, resulting in catastrophic social consequences such as mass migrations, wars, or even population collapses. In this course, the background knowledge of climate-induced and human-induced environmental change will be introduced. The associated physical and social dimensions of environmental change will also be covered. Based on the lessons of the past, together with recent trends in global climate change and social development, the human carrying capacity in contemporary societies will be systematically examined. Some controversial issues related to human-environment nexus will also be discussed. This is a course of general appeal to students with different backgrounds.",

It will provide a variety of perspectives to discuss visions of the future presented by artists from diverse cultural backgrounds, who engage with such global issues as migration, borders, postcolonial conflicts, gender perspectives, environmental crisis, biodiversity, and digital capitalism. It will provide students with foundational knowledge on the emergence, developments, and challenges of global contemporary art discourses, as well as their contesting relationship with artistic autonomy and the society. We will examine a range of topics and methods employed by influential artists and thinkers in various geographies. This will provide a toolkit for understanding and curating contemporary art. To put critical thinking into practice, we will integrate exercises such as screenings and discussions, group projects, and exhibition proposals. Beyond art historical perspectives, we will also delve into questions regarding humans’ relationship with each other and the nonhumans, which are fundamental for understanding global currents and crisis addressed in contemporary art.",

By examining family life, social class, mental health, public performances of happiness, and digital interactions, students will gain insight into how emotions are constructed, expressed, and managed in various contexts. Through case studies, personal narratives, and ethnographic accounts, students will critically analyze how emotions like happiness, shame, bitterness, and depression intersect with broader social expectations and transformations.

Using key concepts and theories from the political economy of media and developmental communication studies, it introduces students to different periods of media reform and social change from the era of Chairman Mao to the period of \"harmonious society\". Emphasis is attached to post-1989 media regulatory systems, media industrialization, and their influence on the meeting of such developmental goals as poverty alleviation, democratization, and communication empowerment.The course will examine Mainland China's key media sectors including the printing press (newspapers and magazines), film and broadcasting media (radio and TV), and new networked communication tools (Internet and mobile phone) as well as alternative social formations through Internet activism, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and transnational developmental projects. The course will identify and discuss several ongoing debates, and the ensuing actions, held by different stakeholders, including governmental officials, media producers, educators, activists, international agencies, and the general audiences. Wider implications to public policy will be identified. There will also be discussions of current affairs related to media and social development in the country.Students will be able to describe the key characteristics of contemporary Mainland Chinese media and their roles in facilitating or obstructing development towards the ideals of a \"new China\".",

A major difference between the Internet-mediated crises and the traditional crises lies in the intensive interactivity, collectivity, simultaneity and dialogic sphericity of the former. This very nature of Internet-mediated crisis makes it all the more hard to handle. A specialized and critical function of the public relations practice is the management of crisis. This course covers two major levels. The first level takes on a functionalism approach to crisis management. The second level takes on a more critical approach in public relations. Students will learn how crisis reflects complicity and dynamism between citizens and organizations in modern societies. They will acquire an enhanced appreciation of communication that can be brought to bear in such crisis situations and a greater familiarity with the interactivity of an organization and its stakeholders as well as the environments in times of crises. They will also gain more sensitivity in public demands of socially responsible practices in the business contexts.",

It is one of the world’s powers with global economic, political, and intellectual influence. Moreover, it shares important ties in the sphere of philosophy, religion, and medicine with China and other Asian societies. Therefore, students will learn about India’s place both in the world and the Asian region, including its ties with Hong Kong. Students will also develop an understanding of the country’s diversity and complex social phenomena such as kinship, communalism, caste system, tribe, third gender, and class. We will discuss pressing issues and theoretical debates related to globalization, sexuality, social movements, religious conflicts, public health, environment, and labor, and how these issues have been shaped by post-colonial politics and current transnational processes.",

Each week the course analyzes, discusses, and rethinks a key concept in the anthropology of work: Class, time, race, gender, value, craft, ownership, creativity, autonomy, discipline, etc. Through reading contemporary ethnographies of different workplaces and circumstances, students will learn the analysis and theory of work in familiar or unexpected forms, as well as in different organizational settings from the office, factory, workshop, home, to online platforms.

In the popular imagination, Japan occupies a complex and often contradictory position. It is home to futuristic anime and an aging population, picturesque villages and dolphin hunts, high-end cameras and the widespread use of quaint fax machines. Engaging with anthropological literature, students will learn to analyze, discuss, and write about various issues and cultural features of Japan, including youth, popular culture, self, family, labor, medicine, and health. An overarching theme will be how Japanese culture and society is changing in the transition to a highly aged society. We will examine persistent cultural patterns as well as the emergence of new forms of social life as residents of Japan grapple with smaller families, precarity, migration, and a rising population of older people. Students will learn how to apply theoretical concepts from anthropology and think critically about Japanese culture and its portrayals in the media. The ethnographic approaches and theoretical perspectives covered in this class will be applicable to other cultural contexts. Since Hong Kong, China, and Korea are following Japan’s path of population aging, this course provides an opportunity to explore cultural issues that have a local and regional significance.",

It shows the significance of culture in the business world, as well as the cultural significance of business. Second, it attempts to put anthropology into business practice. It demonstrates to students how anthropological knowledge and methodologies can be applied to business operations and help to achieve business goals.

This course addresses the ways in which social media and other related interactions in cyberspace have become a central element in the everyday lives of humans across the globe in the 21st Century. Our modern lives are now largely interwoven with digital technologies that have not only changed our own cultures, but also have brought forth new cultural forms through mobile phone technologies, networked “smart”-products, and cultural groupings only possible through digital means. The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes—the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives. The role of anthropology in understanding and capturing human culture in this context anchors on the investigation of how technology is possibly making us ‘more’ human than previous forms of cultural life.",

For example, global environmental challenges, the common threat of nuclear crisis, the controversy between sovereignty and human rights, and the North-South divide. With both the historical and thematic perspectives, the class engages students with most recent research and debate on the topic. On the one hand, the class encourages students to relate their own experiences and observations in their own societies to digest what globalization is and what its impacts are.

The nature of the conventional wisdom of the “youth problem” is critically examined, with the help of concepts and theories in sociology and related fields. By the end of the course, students are expected to gain more understanding of the nature of the phenomenon of problematization of youth, and to look beyond common sense or public perception on current social issues related to the youth in modern society. More importantly, youth problems can jeopardize the sustainable development of youth. [For example, education inequality (SDG4 Quality Education) and inadequate school-to-work transition (SDG8 Decent Work and Economic Growth) could impact on youth poverty (SDG1 No Poverty) as a result.] A broader and deeper understanding of various facets of problematization can inform how youth should be empowered to attain sustainable development in modern society.",

Is it ethical to raise and slaughter animals for food, conduct tests on, and buying or keeping animals as pets? How ought one to respond to unethical laws on animals? What are the social impacts of these actions? Students will develop an interdisciplinary perspective in the fields of animal studies, ethical theory, sociology and environmental philosophy by understanding how ancient and contemporary philosophers, sociologist, environmental scientists, ecologists, activists, and journalists have responded to key ethical questions concerning animal rights and its social implication. Topics to be discussed include: animal-machines, ethical meat eating, radical vegetarianism, and the evolution of pets.This course bears on several of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By transforming our attitude towards and relationship with animal, we enjoy the mental health benefits of a deepened appreciation of and connection with them (SDG#3 Good Health and Well-Being). By exploring the key difference between human and animals, we deepen our understand toward ourself and different species on earth (SDG#14 Life below water & SDG#15 Life on land). Finally, by reimagining our relationship with animal, we can envision for a just society in which all species could co-exist peacefully (SDG#16 Peace, Justice and Strong institutions).",

However, when housing is both an investment capital as well as a necessity, the city is split into an owner-renter dichotomy, with the former preferring an increase of housing prices but just the opposite for the latter. When the pendulum of housing price swings to one side, housing capital can result in negative equity, asset bubble, or even financial crisis. Swinging to the other end, housing can become unaffordable, even if public housing or subsidy can be provided. Decent living environment and sustainable community are the concerns of cities. This introduction course explores the reasons of the housing price fluctuations and the implications of the dichotomy on the city lives.",

It is a significant development strategy proposed by the Chinese Government spanning approximately 60 countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, with a total population of 4.4 billion. This initiative takes advantage of global transportation routes, core cities, and key ports to build international economic co-operation corridors. The effective operation and management of the BRI require collaboration among a broad range of disciplines comprising civil engineering, material science, government operations, economics and finance, social and political science, and environmental science. A critical and multi-disciplinary understanding of the BRI can provide insights into basic requirements, geopolitical impact, physical barriers, and sustainability potential of the infrastructural projects it proposes to undertake and help relevant stakeholders address large-scale and complex challenges in the lifecycle management of those infrastructure projects. This course involves forward-looking perspectives to assess, predict, influence and enhance the in/direct network effects and benefits of the BRI on the cities, urban systems and peoples of the Belt and Road region.",

To what extent does the same language vary due to gender, power, status, and identity? How do men and women, people with higher and lower social status talk differently? How are these relationships reflected in the use of politeness markers and other linguistic devices? What are the implications of sociolinguistics on education and language planning? Through introducing students to major issues in sociolinguistic studies, students will be able to develop a better understanding of how language functions in societal contexts from a linguistic perspective. Discussions will also focus on common sociolinguistic phenomena in daily communication, with a specific emphasis on the use of various languages and dialects spoken in Hong Kong. Exploring these topics will enhance students’ awareness of language as a cultural phenomenon and sharpen their sensitivity to the nuances of language use in the context of a multilingual world, with special reference to the sociolinguistic context of the Greater China area.",

After the pandemic we faced, we realized that a health crisis will have implications beyond the health sector and development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. It is therefore important for us, as global citizens, to recognize the issues related and understand how we can take part in this. Traditionally, health indicators have been an important aspect of development indices and health is a foundation of societies. Therefore, our course aims to discuss SDGs through the lens of health, by providing an overview on how the current global challenges on sustainable development impacts the population health and encourage students to look for solutions. We will cover the health-related SDGs by blended learning, including 2. Zero Hunger where we will discuss malnutrition, 3. Good Health and Well-being where we will discuss road injuries, infrastructure and management, 5. Gender Equality where we will discuss intimate partner violence, 6. Clean Water and Sanitation where we will discuss water safety and supply, 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth where we will discuss labor rights and occupational injuries, 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities where we will discuss impacts on health, socioeconomics and environment of inadequate housing and poor living environment, 13. Climate Action where we will discuss Climate-related disasters and disaster risks, and 16. Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions where we will discuss concept and impact of peace and justice on health. Through face-to-face tutorials and case-based discussions, we will discuss selected topics in greater details, including the road safety aspects of Goal 3 “Good health and well-being”, the protection of workers from work-related injuries in Goal 8 “Decent work and economic growth”, the disaster risks in modern developments in Goal 13 “Climate action”, and how to educate the younger generation on the promotion of peace in Goal 16 “Peace, justice and strong institutions”. Development of modern societies and the interaction between humans and environment will be discussed, and through the advocacy framework we will discuss the current challenges related which draw immense global attention, and allow students to exchange interdisciplinary ideas, identify the challenges we are facing and propose advocacy campaign in hope to identify and deliver solutions locally and internationally.",

It also discusses how these Muslim communities interfaced with each other and integrated with the local society. By establishing a more inclusive and diversified understanding of the local Muslim community, this course responds to the UN Sustainable Development Goals #11 'Sustainable Cities and Communities. Meanwhile, it pinpoints local Muslim communities' challenges in the current globalised world. Islam is one of the most important religions in the contemporary world, which is also a key to achieving a safe and peaceful global environment; therefore, this course also echoes the UN Sustainable Development Goals #16 'Reduced Inequalities'.",

Through the lens of environment, we bring human diversity into presence, examining ways of life of peoples—from Indonesia highlander to Tokyo urbanites—and their words and deeds to tackle crises of planetary scale—climate change, nuclear disaster, air pollution, waste, deforestation. Facing these crises, can anthropological inquiry of the environment help us to explore a humanity that can accommodate living beings of all kind? How can such inquiry inspire us to make changes that create a world we can live together? We’ll follow these trails in the environment to look for engagement and conversation: cultural perception on the origin of agriculture, resource use and religious belief, debating traditional ecological knowledge, globalization and state intervention, environmental justice, land dispossession, waste and pollution, disaster and extreme environment. Through ethnographies of people who are struggling to survive, this course asks why they are pushed into poverty, how their resources being exploited, what they do to fight for justice; it covers SDGs related to the issues of sustainable agriculture (SDG2), tacking climate change (SDG13) and promoting peace, justice and institutional accountability (SDG16).",

      "description": "Health is a fundamental aspect of human existence. We all want good health, effective treatments of illness and affordable health care. Yet we are faced with many challenges and controversies in our pursuit of good health: glaring inequality in health and longevity, the prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle, the conflicts between patients and doctors, the uncertainty of medical treatments and medical knowledge, and the ever-increasing health care spending. In this course, we dissect these issues from the perspectives of social sciences. We first assess the social determinants of health and illness and examine the following topics: the social distribution of health and illness, societal inequality and health, social networks, social capital and health, health lifestyle and public policy, and the interaction between genetics and social environment. We then address the social organization of health and health care and discuss the following topics: the social construction of health and illness, the social context of patient-doctor relationship, and the social organization of healthcare systems. Throughout the course, we will emphasize the current COVID-19 pandemic and use it to illustrate how social and cultural factors influence health and well-being. This course helps the students understand and relate to the following UN sustainable development goals: SDG#3 good health and well-being, SDG#10 reduced inequalities and peace, SDG#16 justice and strong institutions. By illuminating the social and cultural determinants of health and well-being, this course will enrich the students’ understanding of what contributed to good health and well-being, of the unequal distribution of health and well-being, and of the role of social and political institutions in producing health. It also seeks to motivate the students to think about public policies and social interventions that may promote health and well-being, reduce social disparities in health and strengthen health-promoting institutions.

In a context of modernization campaigns and globalization processes, this course illustrates how gender relations and sexual politics are related with historical backgrounds, cultural heritage, market expansion, ideological shifts, and capitalist dynamics. The topics of gender and sexuality will be interwoven with that of migration, work, family, popular culture, mass media, and consumerism. The course will help students to understand issues of discrimination against women and girls, unpaid care and domestic work, access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and equal rights to economic resources, and to reflect on how to promote gender equality (SDG5 among 17 Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs, in the 2030 development agenda). Students will be encouraged to explore localized knowledge and living experiences of gender and sexuality, and to think critically about how to reduce inequality (SDG10) related to social systems of sex and gender.",

      "description": "(UGEC3204 is double-coded with GDRS3006.)  Living Feminisms is all about how to put feminism into practice. Specifically, it is concerned with living out feminist consciousness in every step of making fundamental and lasting social change. With this in mind, Living Feminisms is not an exposition of feminist theories per se but an exploration of how social change effort would look like when we take up feminist consciousness that transcends separateness and duality. It explores the root causes that lead to the domination system that has plagued humanity for centuries, examines the possibility of having a fundamental and lasting social transformation that supports life of all, and takes a closer look at a few selected alternative practices such as restorative justice and sharing economies that hold out hope in times of crises. The course also equips students with practical knowledge of being a change agent, introducing some practices with feminist consciousness that transform limiting beliefs about social change, nourish resilience by taking care of social and political trauma, and cultivate need-based facilitation skills and leadership that help navigate conflicts in the process of making internal as well as external transformation. To put it in a nutshell, Living Feminisms is a course that cultivates change agents with feminist consciousness.Living Feminisms deeply resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint for building a sustainable future by 2030. The course directly touches on alternative practices working towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).",

Broadly defined, innovation refers to new ideas, new knowledge, new technologies, new designs, and creative practices with the goal to solve social or technical problems. Many innovations may seem gender-neutral but are inherently imbued with gender perceptions. The course will equip students with ways to apply gender analysis to decipher innovations and innovative processes. The course incorporates sustainable development goals (SDGs) on Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities to become more discerning toward more sustainable practices to advance Industry Innovation and Infrastructure. Using case studies from the technology culture, the routine practices, and the emergent new economy, students will learn to untangle how gender intersects with the seemingly neutral artefacts of innovation and technology. The course further covers how emergent issues of diversity and inclusion, AI and information technology, social entrepreneurship and social innovation, and leadership style could reshape the existing relationship between gender and innovation to advance sustainability and social resilience.",

      "description": "(UGEC3214 is double-coded with GDRS3026.) This course examines the rich tradition of feminist film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates. Topics will include the key semiotic and psychoanalytic approaches of the 1970s-1990s, classic films which have inspired feminist debate, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, independent cinema, and postmodern cinema, as well as recent cinematic re-conceptualizations and exploration of gender and sexuality local and abroad. In systems of representation from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, women have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object “to-be-looked-at,” in Laura Mulvey’s now often quoted words. Following her trail, feminist critics turned their attention to mainstream films and popular media addressed to female spectators and exposed the contradictions within and between the notion of “women’s pictures” and the diversity of female experience. Local cinemas and independent creators also tell their own unique stories of women’s lives in dramatically different cultural contexts. Critics from other fields further complicate these images by examining them through lens including race, class, ability, queerness, and more.Mulvey’s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the place of women as spectacle or passive object in films “cut to the measure of [male] desire.” Critics around the world showed how different groups of women attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. What happens when female-identified artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? This course starts with the paradigm of narrative film analysis that Mulvey outlined in the 1970s and move on to explore a wider range of questions in feminist film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, (g)local cinema, and new feminist media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by female filmmakers worldwide, special focus will be placed onto important works in Hong Kong cinema for critical examination and comparative studies. Through critical reflections on notions such as gender stereotypes, representation, power, diversity, and equality, the course engages directly with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).",

This course examines the rich tradition of critical film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates, concerning “minority” identities and subalternity. Addressing key discussions about media representations of “minority”, the course will look at the politics of representation and its impacts, both on- and off-screen. We will be looking at how media works to construct “the Other” in different contexts, and delve into important work which have inspired minority cinema, subaltern cinema, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, and independent cinema among other counter-movements, as well as recent re-conceptualizations and exploration of representations marginalized identities, positions, and experiences, local and abroad. Across different systems of representation, from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, different groups, especially marginalized ones with little access to the mechanisms of production, have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object “to-be-looked-at,” in critical film theorist Laura Mulvey’s now often quoted words. Lacking representations both behind the camera and in front of it, how are the lives of different social “minorities” affected by biased media representations? How are stereotypes and biases created, disseminated, perpetuated, and reproduced through media, and to what consequences? Mulvey’s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the standings of different socially and culturally marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities, queer communities, and people with disabilities, etc., as spectacle or passive object “in films cut to the measure of desire” of the dominant social groups.What happens when “minority” artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? Critics showed how different marginalized groups around the world attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. Minority cinemas and independent creators have been actively carving out space to tell their own unique stories of lives at the margin in dramatically different cultural contexts, and these images are further complicated by engagements with them through the intersecting lens including ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, ability, queerness, and more.In the course, we will look at how socially marginalized groups, such as gay and lesbians, transgender persons, ethnic minorities, women in different stages of their lives, people with mental illness, teenagers, the elderlyand many others are portrayed, and seek to expand their on-screen existence in Hong Kong media. In the exploration, we will engage with key questions in critical film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, systems of media production, pro-sumer culture, (g)local cinema, alternative cinema, and new media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by “minority” filmmakers and media creators worldwide, and important cinematic and media movements that challenge the status-quo. Special focus will be placed onto important works in Hong Kong and Asia for critical examination and comparative studies.

      "description": "(UGEC3224 is double-coded with GDRS3009.)  This course examines issues revolving the family as a social institution in different cultures. It explores processes of how the family is constructed in different forms as it intersects with various social systems including kinship, marriage, class, ethnicity, religion, and political economy. Particular attention is paid to how family as a gendered construction, while being a basic principle of social life globally, exhibits great diversity as it shapes and is shaped by local histories, traditions, and state policies. In an era of globalization and transnational mobility, the ideology and practice of the family are rapidly changing, but there are simultaneously trends of reversion and localization. Students will read ethnographies and develop cross-cultural perspectives on classic and contemporary issues concerning the family, such as work and domesticity, motherhoods and fatherhoods, sexual orientations, reproductive technologies, surrogacy and adoption. Students learn to critically think and articulate about family issues, and will acquire enhanced knowledge and skills in reflexive thinking and positive communication, cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion. The course is relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, in particular SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).",

Importantly, gender is among the powerful individual characteristics that affect people's experiences in educational and work settings. Gender shapes youths' experience and outcomes of education across the globe and across history. This course is designed to introduce to students, with a critical mindset, important contemporary issues at the intersection of gender, education and jobs. The topics address the role of gender in school- and related preferences and achievements, with a focus on social and cognitive approaches. For example, what is quality education (SDG goal 4) and why is it important to evaluate it with a gender perspective? Do men and women really differ in their abilities, and if so, by how much? Is personal interest a better explanation of gender imbalances in occupations? What are the ways that biases exist in education and the workplace, and how do teachers, parents, and employers contribute to gender biases (SDG goal 5)? Can gender equality in performance and hiring be improved by removing stereotypes? The literature will cover childhood, adolescence as well as adulthood in order to provide insight into the age-related changes of the gender issues. Particular attention will be paid to issues that relate closely to daily life, both local and international. Empirical evidence will be reviewed to illustrate the gender biases and substantiate the explanatory theories. Potential interventions to address gender biases in education and the workplace will also be discussed.",

The discussions focus on both the structural constraints that LGBTQI+ people face, but also the agency and resilience they display. It explores the development of contemporary LGBTQI+ identities and social movements, as well as the politics involved. The course also asks how gender and sexual diversity is understood in different parts of the world in an era of globalization. Students are also exposed to different practices, policies and laws that are related to LGBTQI+ people’s lives.The Sustainable Development Goals vow to work towards a society where no one if left behind, particularly those who are most vulnerable and marginalized.

      "description": "(UGEC3481 is double-coded with CURE3003.)  How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William’s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals’ life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park – Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla – Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo – Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.",

This course is a survey of Southeast Asian cinema read against the backdrop of its distinct historical, political, ecological, and cultural conditions. Initially a Cold War construct comprising Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, and Timor-Leste, the term ‘Southeast Asia’ has come to refer to a highly complex and pluralistic region of over 660 million people, 25,000 islands, and 150 ethnolinguistic communities. With its national identities formed from the encounter with and struggle against American, British, French, Dutch, Hispanic, Indian, Japanese, and Chinese influence, Southeast Asia’s movies have served as venues for propaganda and resistance. This course looks at how the remediations of different genres such as noir, melodrama, western, and sci-fi tackle controversial issues of gender, race, religion, poverty, migration, and the environment. Instead of smoothening the continuity of official historical narratives, it uncovers how documentaries, epics, and horror reexamine the trauma of past colonization, authoritarianism, and violence. To conclude, the course explores how television serials, anthology films, and online databases trace nascent cross-border and intra-regional communities beyond the limits of sovereignty.",

The course will examine several recurring controversies related to gender in mass media. These controversies range from representation of sex and gender in media, to the media portrayals of homosexuals and the treatment of taboos. The course will identify and discuss the many competing viewpoints, and the ensuing actions, held by different stakeholders, including media producers, social activists, government regulators, educators and the general audiences.
