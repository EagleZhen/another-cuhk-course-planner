      "description": "(UGEC1209 is double-coded with GDRS1001.)  This course aims to develop students’ ability to analyze the everyday life through the lens of gender. Drawing on the interdisciplinary nature of Women’s and Gender Studies, the course will guide students to examine how gender works as one of the primary social organizing principles in the movies we watch, the housework we do, the behaviors we express and many other daily activities that have been routinized. The first three lectures will equip students with a critical gender lens by questioning biology and getting familiar with theories of gender role, socialization, gender schema, doing gender and queer theory. All concepts to be explored in class will be explained with reference to research. At the end of the course, students will come to understand how political their personal life is. In particular, the course hopes to inspire students to take part in creating social change for gender equality, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",

This course examines the development and academic significance of various forms of Japanese popular culture such as films, comics, music, TV dramas and culinary culture, from multidisciplinary perspectives, including history, cultural anthropology, cultural studies and media studies. It aims to deepen understanding the following three facets of Japanese popular culture:1) the applicaton of cultural globalization theory in Japan; 2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries; and 3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society. Using concrete examples and grounding on representative academic writings, this course discusses the globalization of Japanese popular culture and relevant issues in indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows and media-mix. Students are trained to understand the nature and cultural implications of Japanese popular culture in an Asian context. Besides lectures, discussions and readings, this course selectively utilizes topical essays (projects), e-learning, audio-visual materials and fieldwork-based assignments as supplementary teaching tools.",

Having taken this course, students will be equipped with a basic ability to analyse cultural phenomenon in the lens of such cultural concepts as indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows, media mix, cultural colonialism and orientalism.",
      "course_syllabus": "* *Main Objective****:**\n\nThis main purpose of course is to examine the global popularization and localization of Japanese popular culture from historical, cultural and comparative perspectives within the theoretical framework of cultural globalization. It aims to indicate that the cultural flows between Japan and Asia are by no means one-way traffic and Asia has been interacting and collaborating with the Japanese in creating, manufacturing, marketing and distributing cultural products for decades. Lectures, discussions and readings highlight different facets of cultural acculturation and transnational interaction found in Japan-Asia cross-cultural flows, such as appropriation, hybridization, global localization business strategy, the making of localized editions, the local application of Japanese formula, joint production, and the participation of foreign artists and staff. Solidly grounding on empirical data as well as theories from cultural globalization and cross-cultural studies, this course will be a pioneering teaching and learning project to explore uncharted research territories in Japanese studies, Japan-Hong Kong relations, and cultural studies.\n\n* *Key Issues and Problems****:**\n\nThe following key issues and problems regarding the globalization of Japanese popular culture in an Asian context will be addressed in this course within the theoretical fiarnework of cultural globalization:\n\n1) The idea that the influx of Japanese cultural products is a form of cultural imperialism that aims to expand Japanese economic interest and to spread Japanese value and lifestyle in Asia will be empirically and theoretically reexamined and challenged. It shows that cultural imperialism is an outdated model in cross-cultural studies, because it fails to understand the dynamic mechanism in transnational cultural flows and cultural forces of localization and hybridization.\n\n2) While using \"glocalization\" (Roland Robertson uses it to refer to the localization strategy employed by multi-national companies to promote their products in different nations) to investigate the global business strategy of Japanese companies such as Sony, Nintendo, Capcom and Bandai in Asian and global markets, this course underscores the limitation of the glocalization theory in the East Asian context, as it fails to see the initiative taken by Asian artists and businessmen to creatively and selectively domesticate Japanese elements.\n\n3) This course uses Japanese popular culture as a mirror or text to decode social and cultural issues of contemporary Japan. For examples, themes about ethnicity, gender, social hierarchy, political ideology, and cultural identity will be examined in the lens of Japanese popular culture.\n\n* *Core Content, Structure and Selected Topics****:**\n\nThe course content of this course investigates the three facets of Japanese popular culture: (1) the application of cultural globalization theory in Japan, (2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries, (3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society. Accordingly, its structure follows the design of core content and contains the following three parts:\n\nPart 1: Japanese Popular Culture and Cultural Globalization: Theories and Practices\n\nSelected Topics:\n\n(a) Introduction to Basic Theories in Cultural Studies and Cultural Globalization\n\n(b) Globalization of Japanese Popular Culture in an Asian Context\n\n(c) Reexamining the Cultural Imperialism, Orientalism and *Nihonjinron*Discourses\n\n(d) Indigenization and Hybridization of Japanese Popular Culture in Asia (1) Food and Fashion\n\n(e) Indigenization and Hybridization of Japanese Popular Culture in Asia (2) TV Programs\n\nPart 2: Interplay between Globalization and Japaneseness\n\nSelected Topics:\n\n(a) Nihonjinron in Japanese Movies and Alternative Mode of Globalization\n\n(b) The Formation of Japanese Manga and Anime and Their Hybridity\n\n(c) The Making of an Otaku Culture in Japan and Beyond\n\n(d) The Adaptation of Chinese Tradition in Japanese popular culture\n\nPart 3: The Global Strategy of Japanese Cultural Industries\n\nSelected Topics:\n\n(a) Glocalization of Japanese Video Games and Cyber Culture\n\n(b) Transnational Collaboration and Cross-cultural Themes in Japanese Movies\n\n(c) Japaneseness and Universality in Japanese Comics and Animated Series\n\n(d) Exporting and Domesticating Japanese Formula in Asian Drama and Music\n\n(e) Media-mix asa Business Strategy in Japanese Cultural Industries",

      "course_syllabus": "* *Week 1**\n\n* *Lesson 1**\n\nIntroduction to Japanese culture:\n\nThis lesson explains how Japanese culture influences daily life in Hong Kong today. The usage and the characteristics of Japanese language will also be discussed.\n\n* *Week 2**\n\n* *Lesson 2**\n\nIntroduction to the historical changes of kanji and kana in the Japanese language:\n\nThis lesson explains the historical changes of kanji and kana in Japanese language. Focus will be on why Japanese absorbed Chinese characters into their writing system and the process of how Chinese characters were converted to the modern *kana (hiragana and katakana)*.\n\n* *Week 3 – Week 4**\n\n* *Lesson 3**\n\nIntroduction to the phrases expressing linguistic politeness:\n\nThis lesson briefly explains the phrases expressing linguistic politeness. These include honorific expressions, expressions used in making requests, making apologies, expressing gratitude and personal opinions, giving advice and asking for permission. Emphasis will be placed on when and how these expressions are used. The relationship between such expressions and the characteristics of hierarchy in Japanese society will also be discussed.\n\n* *Week 4 - 5**\n\n* *Lesson 4**\n\nStrategies used in making requests and refusals in Japanese:\n\nThis lesson discusses how Japanese make requests and refuse the requests of others. Such expressions are often used in daily life by Japanese but are not easily understood by foreigners. Special attention will be given to:\n\na. the difference in behaviour between Japanese and non Japanese in making requests and refusals.\n\nb. how this behaviour reflects characteristics of Japanese culture.\n\n* *Week 6 – Week 7**\n\n* *Lesson 5**\n\nStrategies used in making apologies and taking responsibility:\n\nThis lesson discusses how Japanese apologize and take responsibility after misconduct such as scandals or accidents. For example, we often see the top management of Japanese companies bow to the public to apologize for their misconduct and they may even quit the company in order to take responsibility for problems. In Hong Kong, it is rare to see such a phenomenon. We will discuss the mechanism of how Japanese make an apology and the effect of the Japanese way of apologizing upon social situations. Special attention will be given to the comparison of the styles of apology in Japanese and Hong Kong societies. We will also discuss the relationship between the Japanese way of apologizing and issues related to the Sino-Japanese War.\n\n* *Week 8 – Week 9**\n\n* *Lesson 6**\n\nAmbiguity in the Javanese language:\n\nCompared with other languages such as Chinese, there are many ambiguous linguistic practices in Japanese. These include, for example, the deletion of the subject \"*watashi*\" (I), the use of \"*koto ni*\n\n* narimashita*\" (become something) rather than \"*koto ni shimashita*\" (I decided to do something) when talking about personal matters such as getting married, and the frequent use of intransitive verbs rather than transitive verbs. Most Japanese language learners including Hong Kong learners have experienced difficulties with these expressions and practices in their learning process. We will analyze and comment on this phenomenon.\n\n* *Week 9 – Week 10**\n\n* *Lesson 7**\n\nThe Business Manner of Japanese:\n\nThis lesson discusses how Japanese behave in business negotiations. Japanese are often criticized for not stating their true feelings and opinions. They often use expressions such as \"*kangaesasetekudasai*\" (Please let me think about it), \"*kekkoo desu*\" (It's O.K. /No, thank you) to indirectly express their opinions. We will discuss why Japanese behave in such a way and the correct way to deal with a Japanese business partner.\n\n* *Week 10 - Week 11**\n\n* *Lesson 8**\n\nJapanese language in a sociolinguistic perspective:\n\nIn this lesson we discuss the following items of importance in sociolinguistics as they appear in the Japanese language.\n\na. the comparison between written and colloquial styles\n\nb. the comparison of language usage for men and women\n\nc. the comparison between the standard language and dialect\n\nd. the comparison of language usage between the young and the elderly\n\ne. the comparison between formal styles and informal styles\n\nf. the comparison between jargon and standard expressions\n\n* *Week 12**\n\n* *Lesson 9**\n\nThe success and failure in learning Javanese language (with a focus on Hong Kong Cantonese speaking learners):\n\nFirst, we will give a brief introduction to the theories of second language acquisition. Next, the factors affecting the results of the process of second language learning will be discussed. To ensure a better understanding, case studies comparing English language acquisition among Japanese and Hong Kong people will be introduced. Finally, by summarizing the above observations and the characteristics of both Japanese and Cantonese, we will comment on the difficulties experienced by Hong Kong Cantonese speaking Japanese learners.\n\n* *Week 13**\n\n* *Lesson 10**\n\nSpecial topics on Japanese 1anguage and Japanese culture:\n\nSpecial topics will be selected to help students understand the relationship between Japanese language and culture.\n\na. *\"shin go ryuukoogo taishoo\"* (New words and buzz terms Grand Prix)\n\nb. *\"kotoshi no kanji\"* (The Chinese character of this year)",

These theories were selected because of their direct relevance for developing an understanding of modern government behaviour.\n* Public administration is often considered in a managerial manner, as little more than control and straightforward analysis of efficiency and economy. This is not necessarily the case. People from different walks of life tend to have different expectations of government. This course is intended to foster a change in attitudes among students. After the course, students are expected to have the ability and tendency to think critically from multidisciplinary perspectives and to provide a critical appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of any theoretical approach.\n* Most important of all, by taking this course, students should have developed an understanding of the basic concepts and theories in public administration and should have gained the ability to apply them to the context of Hong Kong. Public administration, as an area of study, is very much a study based in American context. Therefore, it is important for students to reflect on the concepts and approaches covered in the course, and to consider how they can contribute to a better understanding of public administration in Hong Kong.\n* The course is intended to reinforce communication skills on the part of students.

This is an introductory course that surveys key issues in Chinese politics, including the historical background of the system, the roles of the party/state, the style of leadership, the forms of popular participation, and the distinctive features of Chinese politics. The focus of this course is political change. Classic essays by Sun Yatsen, Lu Xun, Mao Zedong and others provide students with grounding in the key problems modern China has faced, as well as the solutions it has pioneered. From that foundation, we will move on to contemporary institutions and intellectual debates over inequality, human rights, and the future shape of political reform in China.",

      "description": "This course is designed to introduce students to contemporary Korean popular culture, and more specifically the 21st century South Korean cultural phenomenon called Hallyu (Korean wave) – its promises and limitations as well as its popularity and backlash against it. By taking an interdisciplinary approach to the topic, we will study food, film, television, music, fashion and sports and ask how they participate in the transnational production, distribution and circulation of culture, identity, modernity, tradition, ideology and politics both regionally and globally. One of the major questions this course will explore is the curious ways in which these popular media continuously re-stage and re-define Korea’s historical past in order to comment on its present. This course also targets to equip students with analytical tools to critically think about popular culture as well as understand theories of cultural globalization.",

      "description": "This course aims to introduce students to an array of global issues by using popular movies as major teaching instruments. In class, students will learn basic theories of globalization, development of global history since 1945, the contemporary structure of global order, and challenges/opportunities in the realm of global security (e.g. terrorism), global economy (e.g. free trade and inequality), global politics (e.g. global governance). The selected movie texts in this course would serve two purposes: learning tools and learning objects. On the one hand, students will analyze the features and real-life impacts of global issues depicted from these movies. On the other hand, they will also be trained to exercise critical thoughts towards the narratives conveyed from these movies. This course is suitable for students who have no prior knowledge in International Relations or Global Studies.",

Issues to be explored include kinship structures and related gender roles in cross-cultural perspective, the changing relationship between marriage and love, and the various new ways of people “doing” kinship in contemporary societies and the emerging social problems resulted from these changes.

We discuss the effectiveness of these two approaches.\n\nChapter 11&12 Health Consequences of Drug Taking\n\nThese two chapters discuss the associated risks of drug taking, including HIV/AIDS and HCV contraction. We also discuss the effectiveness of the treatment of these drug-related diseases.\n\nVarious topics in relation to drugs and culture, such as cocaine use, club drug use, ketamine use, misuse of prescription drugs, and use of new pharmaceutical products, such as Prozac and Viagra, are the selected topics for this course.",

      "description": "The course introduces students to interdisciplinary studies on urban walks, urban encounters, cultural responses to urban walking experiences and creative interventions reacting to the urban built environment. Since the second half of the 19th century, ways of encountering the city at the street level and various means for capturing and making sense of urban encounters have continuously evolved, the course’s first aim is to introduce to students the history and shifting paradigms for understanding urban experiences in relation to walking. Secondly, the Covid-19 pandemic has substantively revived global interests in urban walks, the second aim of the course is to examine the latest ideas concerning rediscovering the city through different modes of walks. Thirdly, students will learn connecting theories to practices, they will learn to become active “users” of the city and adopt different forms to create new walking experiences and articulate urban experiences.More specifically, the course will focus on how ‘walking in the city’ has become an activity in its own right, and the cultural and social potentials of ‘non-functional’ urban walks. Wandering in the city has its own evolving knowledge and practices, the academic discussion accumulated through the years will be introduced. As such, through urban walks one can encounter the heterogeneity and complexity of cities including but not limited to its built environment, symbolic dimension, flows, natural elements and publicness. The heterogeneity and complexity of the city will be primarily addressed, especially through various schools of thought which have influenced how urban walks have been undertaken. The Sustainable Development Goal 3 ‘Good-Health and Wellbeing’ & Goal 11 ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’ will be covered by the course, as urban walks have been seen as key to achieving wellbeing in recent years and it is also a means for the community to enhance their bonding by sharing local knowledge through walks. Goal 4 ‘Quality Education’ is also covered as walking is increasingly seen as a medium for innovative education and a form of life-long learning outside of the classroom.",

      "course_syllabus": "* *Week 1**\n\n* *Introduction: The renewed interests in urban walks**\n\n* In the first week the overall problem will be introduced, namely how there has been a resurgence of interests in urban walks and its proliferating diversity. In the first week, the introduction aims at demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of the issue and the many dimensions of urban walk as an issue.\n\n* *Week 2**\n\n* *The idea of walking and conceptualizing urban walks**\n\n* Before discussing urban walk specifically, in week 2 the literature on walking as a human behavior will be outlined, some of the key and foundational texts will be discussed.\n* The early attempts to conceptualize urban walks in the 19th century will also be introduced, in particular, the idea of the Flaneur and Charles Baudelaire’s contribution will be outlined. The discussion on Flaneur will be followed by interventions made by the Surrealist, Walter Benjamin and others in the first half of second century.\n\n* *Week 3**\n\n* *Innovating urban walks in the 20th Century**\n\n* Postwar interventions such as the Situationist International and Guy Debord’s thoughts on creative urban walks will be introduced, together with other modern artists and architectural theorists’ initial detour into the realm of experimental walks. The discussion will be put in contrast with Jane Jacobs’ ideas with more focus on urban planning and community.\n\n* *Week 4**\n\n* *A Japanese school of walk: Modernology and ‘Street Observations Studies’**\n\n* While week 3 and week 4 largely focus on Anglo-European ideas, the substantial contribution made by Japanese artists and urban theorists will be introduced. In this week, students will practice ‘street observation’ on campus, as the initial attempt to put theory into practice.\n\n* *Week 5**\n\n* *Walkscapes: Contemporary art and the aesthetical turn**\n\n* More artistic attempts to reinvent the practice of urban walks will be introduced in this week, in the lecture the ideas from performance studies will also be discussed to support the debates on aesthetical dimension of urban walks.\n\n* *Week 6**\n\n* *Walkability, well-being and the body**\n\n* Functional dimensions of urban walks and policy related concerns will be discussed in this lecture. The lecture will also briefly introduce ideas about corporeal geography and non-representational theory, as the theoretical discussion will bring up the non-cognitive aspects of walk.\n(Addressing SDG goal 3)\n\n* *Week 7**\n\n* *Field trip 1: Walks about capturing urban experiences and experimental walks**\n\n* The field trip will be about more ‘conventional’ approach to urban walk as an aesthetic practice, it will be about how heterogeneous urban experiences and observations could be gained.\n(Addressing SDG goal 4)\n\n* *Week 8**\n\n* *Heterogeneous urban experiences: Sensory and visual**\n\n* The lecture will focus on the types of sensory and visual data could be gained from urban walks, the literature analyzing and conceptualizing these data and experiences will be outlined.\n\n* *Week 9**\n\n* *Cataloguing and expressing urban experiences: The idea of forms**\n\n* The lecture will focus on how various forms are employed to catalogue and reorganize the urban experiences gained from urban walks. The forms include moving images, still images, literary experimentation, and research projects.\n\n* *Week 10**\n\n* *Field trip 2: Walk design and the idea of journey design**\n\n* The field trip will be a practical guidance discussing how various forms of walks, guided tours and journey are designed and created. It will be followed by a more conceptual discussion on the experience economy and experiential cultural consumption.\n(Addressing SDG goal 11)\n\n* *Week 11**\n\n* *Walking in Hong Kong**\n\n* The lecture will explore how the idea of urban walk has been picked up and discussed in the context of Hong Kong. The initial idea of Hong Kong as a ‘City of Walk’ will be discussed.\n(Addressing SDG goal 11)\n\n* *Week 12**\n\n* *Workshop: Presenting a walk design project (1)**\n\n* The workshop will be an interactive session for students to showcase their creative ‘walk-design’ projects, the lecturer will give substantial feedback and moderate dialogues in order to foster imagination and creativity for creating potential cultural projects concerning urban walk and urban experiences\n(Addressing SDG goal 4)\n\n* *Week 13**\n\n* *Workshop: Presenting a walk design project (2) & Conclusion**\n\n* The workshop will be an interactive session for students to showcase their creative ‘walk-design’ projects, the lecturer will give substantial feedback and moderate dialogues in order to foster imagination and creativity for creating potential cultural projects concerning urban walk and urban experiences\n* The conclusion will point to recent discussion on the future role of urban walks and cities that empower the community\n(Addressing SDG goal 4)",

      "description": "Surprisingly, as one of the world’s most modern cities, often thought of as a city of skyscrapers, Hong Kong has an incredibly rich and diverse cultural heritage. This is reflected in its wide diversity of buildings and monuments; including ancient temples, walled villages, and legacies of its colonial period including Tai Kwun, Heritage 1881, and more recent glass and steel structures such as Norman Foster’s HSBC Building. Hong Kong also has many museums and galleries containing important representations of Chinese and other cultures which were important in the development of modern Hong Kong. These range from works of art, through to the seemingly more mundane legacy of Hong Kong’s colonial history, and evidence its pre and post-colonial heritage. This course considers the issues which face this heritage, and the legal framework and other protection affecting cultural heritage in Hong Kong. Among other topics, the course will consider: the law and policy intended to safeguard built heritage in Hong Kong; the law and policy affecting antiquities and other forms of portable heritage including private and public collections in Hong Kong; the law and policy affecting street art and public expressions of Chinese culture; the history of looted heritage including Hong Kong’s looted heritage and Hong Kong’s role in the illicit trafficking of looted heritage from China, and the law which is intended to prevent this illicit trade; the law and policy intended to safeguard Hong Kong’s water heritage including shipwrecks, and treasure hunting; and, the law and policy intended to safeguard the newest and richest recognised form of cultural heritage- intangible cultural heritage, including Cantonese opera, dragon-boat racing, bamboo scaffolding, neon signs and milk tea.This course will consider the threats that Hong Kong’s cultural heritage faces and the law and other safeguarding measures that have been implemented and may be introduced to promote Sustainable Development Goals including, among others, Life on Land (SDG 15), Life Below water (SDG 14), Climate Action (SDG 13), and Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11).",

      "description": "This course provides an overview of the key challenges of the world population [in the 21st century]. For example, aging or overpopulation in urban cities, environmental degradation, food and water resource crisis, large-scale voluntary and involuntary migration, and spread of communicable disease. A key goal of the course is to map out the linkages between population patterns, trends, and some of the socio-economic issues that occur locally, nationally, and at the global level which bring great challenges to our society. You will learn the concepts, theories, and data essential in the scientific study of the size, composition, and spatial distribution of human populations; and the changes that occur in these phenomena through the processes of fertility, mortality, and migration. You will gain an understanding of the roots of population structures, processes, and the consequences for individuals, family, and societies, and how it will affect and be affected by natural resources availability or depletion and health care system. Students will acquire the basic ability to analyze, explain and present the potential crisis facing the population system. In particular, this course will stimulate students’ interest in understanding how the population could be linked to sustainable development, and reflect on the relationship between population growth and availability of resources, as well as the relationship between population and social institutional arrangements such as child and old care support, job supply and public asset distribution. In the end, students will learn to apply their skill and knowledge in proposing solutions for solving population-related challenges for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for example, zero hunger and no poverty, good health and well-being, reducing social inequality including gender inequality, maintaining decent work and economic development while developing more sustainable cities and communities.",

      "description": "This course is designed to offer an exhaustive and nuanced exploration of the intricate patterns and rich historical tapestries of urban development worldwide, viewed through a geographic lens. Throughout this course, students will be introduced to a wide range of theories and concepts that are intricately linked to the social and economic evolution of cities across different world regions. These theories and concepts include colonialism, postcolonialism, capitalism, neoliberalism, globalization, post-industrial development, urbanization, and urban sprawl. By exploring these theories and concepts, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of urban development within diverse geographic contexts and with varying historical backgrounds. This course is relevant to SDGs 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). It will provide students with the knowledge and tools to identify inequalities in urban development and analyze the challenges and opportunities in achieving sustainable cities and communities. The curriculum is thoughtfully divided into five key sections, each providing an in-depth analysis of urban development in different regions – Europe, America, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Greater Middle East, and Asia. These sections are carefully curated to help students gain a profound understanding of the diverse economic, political, cultural, and historical influences that have shaped and continue to shape urban landscapes in these varied regions. Students will engage with diverse learning methodologies. This includes detailed case studies that provide real-world examples of urban development, scholarly readings that offer academic perspectives, visual aids that illustrate key concepts, and interactive discussions that encourage critical thinking and collaborative learning. Ideal for students with a passion for urban studies, geography, history, sociology, or related disciplines, this course offers a unique opportunity to explore the world of urban development in a global context, preparing them to become informed and engaged global citizens.",

      "course_syllabus": "As shown below, the course contents will be divided into 5 parts and 12 topics.\n\nPart I: World urban development (1 lecture)\n\nThe course begins with a singular, foundational lecture that sets the stage for understanding global urban development. It introduces key concepts, trends, and the factors driving urbanization worldwide, providing a global context for the more detailed regional studies that follow.\n\n1. World urban development\n\n世界城市發展\n\nPart II: Europe (3 lectures)\n\nThe European segment consists of three lectures. The first lecture focuses on the development of European cities from ancient times to modernity, highlighting the impacts of technological, social, and economic development on the evolution of urban landscapes and patterns. The second lecture takes students on a journey to explore distinctive cities across Europe, examining the unique characteristics that define them. In particular, we will discuss the issue of camera surveillance in London, the refugee crisis in Paris, post-socialist development in Berlin, and superblocks and walkability in Barcelona. The final lecture in this section shifts focus to Russia, discussing both historical and contemporary aspects of Russian urban development, and offering insights into the evolution of its cities amidst political and social changes. Students will learn about the unique urban landscape of Russian cities inherited from their imperial and Soviet histories and discuss issues such as the environmental crisis of Norilsk and the problem of street children in post-Soviet cities.\n\n2. Historical perspectives on urban development in Europe\n\n歐洲城市發展的歷史觀察\n\n3. Exploring distinctive cities in Europe\n\n探索歐洲特色城市\n\n4. Historical and contemporary Russian cities\n\n俄羅斯城市的歷史與現狀\n\nPart III: America (3 lectures)\n\nThis section, also encompassing three lectures, begins by delving into the history of urban development in Latin America. It examines the colonial impact, post-colonial developments, and contemporary challenges. The subsequent lecture takes students on a virtual tour of unique Latin American cities, exploring their cultural, architectural, and social nuances. We will discuss the issues of favelas in Rio de Janeiro, the impact of modernism on urban design and architecture in Brasilia, and gated communities in Buenos Aires. The last lecture of this section examines North American cities, discussing issues such as racial and social segregation in New York City, the development of shared mobility and sustainable transportation systems in Portland, auto dependence and urban sprawl in Los Angeles, and post-industrial development and gentrification in Toronto.\n\n5.

      "credits": "2.00",
      "terms": [],
      "description": "The universal appeal of classical music is masked by a troubled past. It is a complex story of white colonization by European powers, spanning centuries and continents. Classical music has its own colonial baggage, too, with links to slavery profits and other problematic phenomena, whether in the gendered tradition of the “great composers,” or in a thriving piano industry of the early 20th century, which resulted in forced labor and countless deaths in the colonial ivory trade, or in the transnational circulation of opera in and beyond the 19th century, which would not have been possible without the port city networks of rapidly expanding empires. Importantly, such legacies have led to new forms of advocacy aimed at decolonizing classical music today. This SDG-GE course will examine how current practices around the world, on the back of complex and violent histories, attempt to democratize classical music in lockstep with the needs and concerns of contemporary society. What does it mean to decolonize musically in the 21st century, recenter marginalized individuals and groups in classical music, and make classical music more sustainable and reflective of a fair society? These questions run through the three themed sections of the syllabus: i) gender and representation, ii) equality, diversity, inclusion, iii) institutions and justice. We will explore related ideas and concepts, in connection with past contexts and present practices, including orchestras, opera companies, community projects, and social enterprises. By drawing on a variety of perspectives, we will discuss how and why decolonizing classical music matters, to whom, along with its ongoing challenges for improving and enhancing equity.  This course engages directly with SDGs 5, 10, and 16. Through the three themed sections, we will assess how classical music practices today can be observed to respond to the identified SDGs, particularly in terms of further empowering indigenous women musicians, reducing age-old inequalities, and promoting greater social justice from within institutions that can better reflect the untold tales and human experiences of classical music.  Neither score-reading nor prior musical knowledge is required for this course.",

Students will explore the topic of representation and related contexts and practices in decolonizing classical music, as well as efforts to address issues of gender and race, visibility, and difference through new forms of advocacy.\n\n* “The white-male canon”: decolonizing musically in the 21st century\n\nSession goal: To introduce the idea of decolonization, together with the phenomenon of a gendered and racialized musical canon, both in the historical contexts of European colonization around the world, and in dialogue with decolonizing classical music today across university education and the performing arts.\n\n* Indigenous women in classical music, then and now\n\nSession goal: To consider the visibility of indigenous women in classical music, by examining the impact of colonial oppression on their prospects and mobility, along with present challenges and opportunities for their artistic and social empowerment.\n\n* Difference\n\nSession goal: To explore the work of queer and non-binary musicians and organizations today, and its significance for articulating difference in classical music and moving on from its colonial past.\n\nII: Equality, diversity, inclusion (EDI)\n\nThe second section of the course engages with SDG 10. Students will explore the topic of EDI and related contexts and practices in decolonizing classical music, as well as efforts to reduce systemic, distributive, and discriminatory inequalities through new forms of advocacy.\n\n* EDI in classical music: recentering the marginalized\n\nSession goal: To examine the role marginalized voices play in advancing new community projects, social enterprises, and other grassroot initiatives in the decolonization of classical music, with a focus on systemic inequalities stemming from the legacies of music and empire.\n\n* EDI in classical music: “de-westernization”\n\nSession goal: To explore the function of regional and local identities in the decolonization and “de-westernization” of classical music, with a focus on distributive inequalities tied to age-old perceptions of “the West and the rest.”\n\n* EDI in classical music: creative disability\n\nSession goal: To understand how disabled artists, disability service organizations, and adaptive technologies contribute to creativity disability in the decolonization of classical music, and against an historical backdrop of discriminate inequalities, shaped by Victorian pathological distinctions of “normal” and “abnormal.”\n\nIII: Institutions and justice\n\nThe third and final section of the course engages with SDG 16. Students will explore the topic of social justice and related contexts and practices in decolonizing classical music, as well as institutional efforts at making classical music more sustainable and reflective of a fair society.\n\n* Orchestras in the 21st century\n\nSession goal: To explore the orchestra as a decolonising force and public institution, particularly the ways and the extent to which it augments social justice and participation through classical music of the 21st century.\n\n* Opera companies in the 21st century\n\nSession goal: To explore the opera company as a decolonising force and public institution, particularly the ways and the extent to which it augments social justice and participation through classical music of the 21st century.",

This approach to development should not only generate economic growth, but also distribute its benefits equitably, regenerate the environment rather than destroy it, as well as empower people rather than marginalize them. The UN 2030 Agenda came into effect in 2015 promising to “interlink and integrate” Sustainable Development Goals in an attempt to implement solutions facing humanity. Sustainable development goals are an all-inclusive invitation to act to end poverty, secure the planet and ensure that all people appreciate peace and prosperity.This course introduces the concept of sustainable development, the evolution of models and the implicit assumptions they make, as well as their contradictions. It also traces the advent of the SDGs and the extent that they support the principles of sustainable development. We examine the emergence of environmental problems and critically review the institutional responses to these problems since the late 1960s. We then consider in detail the increasingly popular idea of efforts in the pursuit of the SDGs from different perspectives that centres around people, planet, prosperity, peace and the partnerships involved in achieving the goals. The lectures will explore how achieving sustainable development goals will depends much on effective planning and good governance. Examples from different parts of the world will be used to underline the tight inter-connections between processes in different regions and across geographical scales in the context of sustainable development.",

      "description": "(UGEC2188 is double-coded with ENGE2530.) The objective of this course is to give students an overview of the status, features, and use of Hong Kong English (HKE), the variety of English commonly used in Hong Kong. In the first part of the course, students will be introduced to the concept of ‘world Englishes’ and examine different theoretical frameworks for conceptualizing the evolution of new varieties of English. The course then examines relationship between Hong Kong English and Hong Kong culture from cultural, social, historical, and educational perspectives, particularly in relation to and juxtaposition from Cantonese and Putonghua. The second part of the course examines both spoken and written features of HKE, including grammar, discourse particles, vocabulary, and pronunciation, as well as the practices of code-mixing and code-switching. This section of the course also focuses on the social impact of the use of these features in Hong Kong culture. In the third part of the course, language attitudes and ideologies towards ‘standard’ language varieties (for example American and British English) in relation to HKE will be explored. The course will also examine the relationship between use of HKE and social identity as well as gender in Hong Kong culture.",

      "description": "(UGEC2189 is double-coded with ENGE2600.) Although English has long spread around the world, the consequences of this spread are only now beginning to be appreciated by speakers in diverse cultures and societies. English has changed the world, impacting specific local cultures in both positive and negative ways. But English has also been localized and acculturated, made to express the realities of diverse cultures and societies, and so the language has been changed in turn. The discourse of world Englishes aims to re-imagine our understanding of the language. The difference between error and innovation can no longer be decided by reference to ‘ownership’ of the language. Additionally, the language is beginning to be a medium of the expression of identity for more and more people in very different social and cultural contexts. World English must be pluralized, which is why we think in terms of world Englishes. This course is split into two sections. The first section will introduce you to issues in the discourse of world Englishes: innovation, variety, creativity, globalization, etc. The second section will look at specific case studies in different cultures and societies, and will focus on Asian Englishes, e.g. English in Singapore, China, and Japan. Different Asian cultures have distinct historical experiences with English, leading to different levels of cultural penetration (e.g. in popular culture) and depth of function (e.g. in business and law). The second section looks at different examples to explore their specific cultural engagements with the English language, but also to identify what they have in common: Japan English and Singlish develop in very different cultures, but the course with emphasis comparison as well as contrast.",

Many have celebrated English as a global language, and the course will consider both positive and negative possibilities that will be investigated using specific examples later in the term.\n\nHistories of English: Crystal, ‘Why a Global Language?’, from *English as a Global Language* (Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp.1-27.\n\nThis week looks back to some of the important histories of how English became a global language, particularly the connections with capitalism and colonialism. It will explore the charge that English today is a form of linguistic imperialism.\n\nMistakes and Creativity: Quirk, ‘Language varieties and standard language’, *English Today* 21 (1990), pp.3-10.\n\nWhat do people look for when learning a language? This week wonders why, if we would never imagine World Russians or World Chineses, it seems important to accept World Englishes. We will ask if English still has clearly defined centres of authority, or whether it is now dispersed and plural.\n\nStandards: Modiano, ‘International English in the Global Village’, *English Today* 58 (1999), pp.22-27.\n\nThis week’s discussion will focus on the need for standards, and question whether our standards should come from native speakers. Many aspects of international life (scientific discourse, aviation) currently depend on English, but perhaps native speakers are not well placed to help develop these standards. We will think about why that might be true, and how we should test Englishes in future.\n\nEnglish in Asia: Kachru, ‘English as an Asian Language’, *Links and Letters* 5 (1998), pp.89-108.\n\nThe focus of the course shifts this week to Asia as a specific example (or series of examples) of the World Englishes. In some ways, English does not appear to belong in Asia, and yet it has clearly been accepted, and we will explore the different ways English functions and has penetrated cultural life.\n\nSingapore: Ho, ‘“I’m not west. I’m not east. So how leh?”’, *English Today* 87 (2006), pp.17-24.\n\nSingapore allows us to think about the general issues clearly because it is a restricted example. Everyone is familiar with Singlish, but what exactly does Singlish show us about the cultural life and social development of this relatively young city-state? The week examines different and sometimes contradictory aspects of English in Singapore.\n\nJapan: Stanlaw, ‘The dynamics of English words in contemporary Japanese’, from *Japan English* (Hong Kong University Press, 2004), pp.11-37.\n\nShifting attention from former British colonies, this week explores Japan as an example where English seems to depend on another native speaker country, the United States. However, if we ask how Japanese society and culture actually uses English, far from being dependent on native speaker standards, we see independent creativity.\n\nChina: Hu, ‘Why China English should stand alongside British, American, and the other “World Englishes”’, *English Today* 78 (2004), pp.26-33.\n\nGiven the rise of China, it is obvious to ask, does China even need English? And does it need a specific China English? Exploring varied examples, this week considers the long history of English in China and some possible futures, in particular of Putonghua alongside English.",

Hong Kong is the main focus of discussion though examples or cases in Mainland China and around the world are also provided throughout the course. Critical issues in ecotourism such as its multi-dimensional impacts, governance, planning, and resource and visitor management will also be covered. Lastly, students will be exposed to the relation of the phenomenon of ecotourism and the concept of sustainable tourism. Some of the lectures will address SDGs, for example, Goals 12, 16 and 17 embrace the knowledge and evolution of environmentalism and nature-human relationship; Goals 14 and 15 connect with the concept of protected areas and environmental conservation; Goals 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 12 and 13 cover multi-dimensional tourism impacts and, more importantly, climate change issue.

      "description": "The pursuit of ideal living environment has long been a human undertaking throughout history. Because of environmental variations, some places are definitely better than the others for living and development. In ancient time, man strived for searching a nice place for settlement where could provide a better resource base. Nowadays, man acquires sciences and technologies to change or even create the environment that makes living pleasant and comfortable. Those human settlements which develop an integrated and sustainable approach to the environmental, economic and social challenges will have more chance to grow and prosper.Ideal living environment is closely related with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG11 and SDG13 with topics covered in this course. Sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11) directly address the need for safe, inclusive, and resilient living environments. It includes targets for affordable housing, sustainable urban planning, and access to green and public spaces, resilient building. Climate Action (SDG 13) mitigates climate change impacts through sustainable practices which helps protect living environments from extreme weather events and environmental degradation. By focusing on these related SDGs, students can create their ideal living environments by promoting sustainability, enhancing quality of life and addressing climate change challenges that not only meet the needs of current communities that are inclusive, resilient and environmentally friendly, but also ensure sustainability for future generations.This course provides students with the insights needed to gain an understanding of ideal environment for living from the perspective of a geographer. Key themes include searching for the best location, the rise of city, forms of human settlement, ideal living and quality of life. As the course examines the understanding of ideal environment for living from different angles, students will not only gain objective geographical knowledge about the relationship between man and environment, but also learn how some urban challenges and issues are tackled. Ecological civilisation, landscape cities and sustainable development of ideal living environment will also be explored. While the coverage will be broad and pluralistic, examples and cases of Hong Kong, mainland China, and other parts of the world will be emphasized. In order to enhance the learning experience, an interactive teaching mode will be adopted in the lectures so that the instructor can guide students to analyse the cases and issues through discussions.",

The course adopts a multidisciplinary approach to examine the different issues of food and hunger, and how they change over time. The causes of world hunger will be analyzed with special emphasis on food production systems, bearing in mind there is no single solution to the problem. Moreover, the course delves into the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of hunger, examining how issues such as poverty, food insecurity, and climate change intersect to exacerbate the problem. Towards the end of the course, students will gain a deeper understanding of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) through an exploration of sustainable agricultural practices and strategies to address global hunger challenges in the 21st century.

      "description": "Popular representations of the African continent produced in global discussions are marked by a stereotyped image of Africa, its culture, environment and development. The purpose of this course is to critically examine the common framing of Africa as a continent of conflict, disasters, poverty and a region that is perpetually in need of external intervention. In addition to the myth that surrounds Africa, there is a growing dynamics of activities resulting into the current interest on the continent. Earlier, the UN settled on the Agenda 2030 as a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity for the whole world. This plan dovetails very well with the Africa’s Agenda 2063. This therefore provides an opportunity to identify where Africa situates on SDG issues that include its people, its environment and its economic development.The course will therefore present to students the context of Africa relating to its geography, environment, culture as well as contemporary development issues shaping the destiny of Africa. Through lectures, guest speakers, videos and possibly field studies, students will be able to critically evaluate the stereotypical notion of Africa as a continent rather than as a country as is quite often misconstrued. The course will provide an intellectual platform to understand and analyze issues from a multi-disciplinary perspective as they relate to Africa and humanity. The students will be able to interpret and explain in broad terms, the contemporary position of Africa as it relates to other parts of the world with special attention to its relationship with Asia and China in particular.",

      "description": "Cities have always been magnets attracting a growing number of citizens. The unprecedented pace of urbanization has recently witnessed a historic shift of human population with the majority now living in cities. The growth of cities in this age of globalization raises many opportunities and challenges, concerning the quality of life, poverty, sustainability, environmental degradation and urban competitiveness. All of which deserve our attention.This course offers students a comprehensive understanding of cities and urban challenges from the perspective of sustainable development. It examines the historical, social, economic, cultural and environmental dimensions of cities. As the course focuses on urban issues at global, regional and local levels, students will not only gain knowledge about the causes and impacts of urban problems, but also learn how different stakeholders can help achieve sustainable liveable cities in the age of globalization. By adopting an issue-based approach, different SDGs such as no poverty (SDG 1), industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), reduced inequality (SDG 10) and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), will be included in a variety of topics ranging from socio-economic to environmental aspects in the course. Different cities will be chosen as case studies for understanding various urban challenges and solutions. Apart from lectures, students will develop critical thinking on various urban challenges that affect their daily lives through video discussion, group projects and presentation in the discussion forums.",

      "description": "(UGEC2243 is double-coded with CURE2018.)  Human have altered the environment in ways that have no precedence in human history. Ecological crisis, environmental degradation, and extreme weathers have become the watchwords of contemporary politics. The conventional boundaries between “nature” and “culture” are now being questioned. How do nature, culture and power intersect in our everyday life? How do we get to understand issues of sustainability and environmental crisis from a broad historical perspective and global activism angle? How are gender, class and race interact with technology, damaged environment, animal and plant species? This course explores these questions and the rich debates in the emerging field of environmental humanity and literature of the Anthropocene.Class topics are organized on major global green movements that resisted oil pollution, toxic factories, logging companies, dam constructions and nuclear plant building. Students get to learn the historical developments of major environmental activism in the West and the global south. How was the Greenpeace founded? What is the Narmada Dam Movement in India? Do you know Ken Saro-Wiwa, an environmental activist against Shell oil pollution in Nigeria? In each class we examine historical texts, visual materials and theoretical debates to explore how environmental justice has been intertwined with histories of colonialism, neoliberalism, and questions of gender, race, poverty and class. Together the class explores the problem of the Anthropocene (Nature) in the context of colonial history, grass root struggles (Culture) and corporation greed (Power).This course addresses many of the 17 United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Climate Actions (13), Life on Land (15), Life below Water (14), Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (16), Clean Energy (7), Reduced Inequalities (10), and Gender Inequality (5). Students are able to identify the weekly course content aligned with specific SDGs and be able to understand these goals in both historical and contemporary contexts.",

      "description": "(UGEC2245 is double-coded with CURE2007.) Celebrity culture is generally understood as a cult full of short-lived trends and inconsequential fan behaviour. We seldom consider, however, the powerful influence it has over our cultural identities. This course examines how the interplay between celebrity culture and the cultural industry shapes cultural identity with case studies from Hong Kong as the major scope of study. Starting with a brief history of Hong Kong celebrity culture from the 1980s to the present day, the course offers an entry point for students to understand the intricate relationship between the media and celebrity culture, encompassing a wide range of cultural icons and phenomena such as action film actors, cross-media megastars, and YouTube micro-celebrities. Each case study will engage with key concepts in celebrity culture, such as star-text, commodification, authenticity, extratextual reading, and participatory reading. The course proceeds by introducing the critical perspective of cultural studies in making sense of representation politics, public culture, fandom studies, and the diverse modes of intimacy in the digital age. Overall, students will gain an understanding of celebrity culture and how identities are thus produced, promoted, and commodified in the wider arena of media and popular culture.",

Feminists fight for equality by publications, demonstrations and organizations. In 20th century, the feminist movement matured. Feminists have been more sensitive to the differences among women of different race, class, culture, religion and circumstances and noticed the importance of differences in unity. This course will introduce the strategies and main arguments of various kinds of feminism. Through learning from others’ experience, history and our daily life, we will understand the development of diversity in feminisms. We can have more understanding of feminists fighting for the right of disadvantage groups by self-review and mutual criticism in different times and culture.",

Beginning with an introduction presenting the main characteristics of this medium, this course will trace its development, from the beginnings of storytelling with images in Antiquity to the latest innovations. Even though they have retained their own characteristics over the last two centuries, Western European and North American comics have also developed in close proximity. Following the development of the press and book industry, as well as other media like cinema, comics and graphic novels have a rich history that can only be understood in their cultural context. This course is designed to allow students to understand how this medium has shaped and been shaped by many aspects of the history and cultures of these places.",

However, in this globalization era, people often have many cultural lenses. Through understanding the impact of globalization on cultures and societies, we will have nuanced understanding of how people from different cultures construct reality. Many scholars and activists argue that globalization will lead to a worldwide homogenized consumer culture dominated by Western values. Others believe that globalization can lead to the clashes of incorrigible cultures. Meanwhile, globalization has catalyzed formation of new hybrid cultures and fostered the blooming of creative cultural industries. In this course, we will explore the above topics through understanding the effects of globalization on personal identities, the economy, consumerism, and communication, etc. in the immediate and distal environment.",

      "description": "(UGEC2352 is double-coded with GLSD2301.) This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to global politics, focusing in particular on its origins and historical evolution, its key concepts, major theoretical frameworks, main actors and institutions, the global architecture of power, and its dynamic nature in the process of globalization. It aims to offer students with the basic knowledge and analytical tools for making sense of current issues in global politics. It adopts a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates theoretical issues with regional case studies. The course will first offer a general survey of the key concepts and major theoretical perspectives in the study of Global Politics (Liberalism, Realism, Social Constructivism and Marxist theory, etc.). It then proceeds to cover selected topics of global politics in the areas of War and Peace and the Clash of Civilization. It focuses on how world politics is transformed by globalization, with a particular focus on its impacts on issues concerning the identity and national pride, balance of power, peace and conflicts, borders and security, etc. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of latest trends of global governance, with a particular focus on the emergency of international and regional organizations. Relevant real world examples and case studies will be adopted to illustrate the big ideas and key concepts of global politics.This course intends to promote students’ appreciation of the role of ‘power’, ‘security’ and ‘justice’ in shaping the global political order nowadays. Students will gain deeper insights into not only latest developments in global political affairs, but also concepts and theories useful for further studies in politics, international relations, and global political economy. The course is designed to introduce essential concepts, major theoretical perspectives and basic mechanisms of global political order, allowing students to communicate issues in world politics effectively in group work and individually, in oral as well as written forms.",

      "description": "(UGEC2353 is double-coded with GLSD2501.) This course aims to provide students the foundational knowledge on the operation of world economy and examine how social, political and institutional factors contribute to the creation of global economic order. It examines the intertwining and interaction of economics (wealth creation) and politics (political power) in global affairs.The course will first offer a general survey of the key concepts and major theoretical perspectives in the study of Global Political Economy (GPE) (Liberalism, Mercantilism, and Marxist theory, etc.). In the second part, we cover substantive policy issues including international trade and monetary system, foreign investment and multi-national corporations, etc.. It focuses on how the world economy is transformed by globalization, with a particular focus on the development of various international and regional institutions that govern the current economic order. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of latest trends of global economic governance, with a particular focus on the transforming role of national states and the endeavors of international development on poverty and inequality reduction. Relevant country experiences will be adopted to illustrate the dynamics of economic growth and stability. GLSD2501 intends to promote students’ appreciation of the role of institutions and politics in the operation of global economic order.

To balance this, the instructor will provide Asian examples in the lecture materials."

      "description": "(UGEC2354 is double-coded with GLSD2401.)  The course introduces the concept of human carrying capacity in the globe. The capacity symbolizes the balance between population size and environmental resources ––the underlying foundation for sustainable development. In history, it is shown that the human carrying capacity was periodically shrunk by climate deterioration and human-induced environmental degradation, resulting in catastrophic social consequences such as mass migrations, wars, or even population collapses. In this course, the background knowledge of climate-induced and human-induced environmental change will be introduced. The associated physical and social dimensions of environmental change will also be covered. Based on the lessons of the past, together with recent trends in global climate change and social development, the human carrying capacity in contemporary societies will be systematically examined. Some controversial issues related to human-environment nexus will also be discussed. This is a course of general appeal to students with different backgrounds.",

      "description": "(UGEC2371 is double-coded with FAAS2118.) Contemporary art is diverse and expansive, and its timeline, topics, and aesthetic strategies, are continually redefined. This course offers an introduction into political and aesthetic issues addressed in global contemporary art, particularly since 1989 which marked the fall of the Iron Curtain and the first primordial “global” exhibition at Centre Pompidou. It will provide a variety of perspectives to discuss visions of the future presented by artists from diverse cultural backgrounds, who engage with such global issues as migration, borders, postcolonial conflicts, gender perspectives, environmental crisis, biodiversity, and digital capitalism. It will provide students with foundational knowledge on the emergence, developments, and challenges of global contemporary art discourses, as well as their contesting relationship with artistic autonomy and the society. We will examine a range of topics and methods employed by influential artists and thinkers in various geographies. This will provide a toolkit for understanding and curating contemporary art. To put critical thinking into practice, we will integrate exercises such as screenings and discussions, group projects, and exhibition proposals. Beyond art historical perspectives, we will also delve into questions regarding humans’ relationship with each other and the nonhumans, which are fundamental for understanding global currents and crisis addressed in contemporary art.",

      "course_syllabus": "1. **Introduction: Autonomy**\n\nIn this introduction session, we will cover some fundamental ideas and debates of global contemporary art, including the issues of autonomy, timeline, and social engagements, referencing theories and curatorial practices since 1989. Drawing from selected international museum collections, we will unpack a variety of institutional and geopolitical contexts that contributed to the formation of global contemporary art.\n\n1. **Feminism**\n\nThis session will be devoted to feminist criticisms in art history, specifically the dialogues between women’s art and feminist movements between the 1970s and post 2000s. We will draw from several group exhibitions in Asia and the Americas post-1989 to discuss the issues of essentialism and representation in feminist Art histories.\n\n1. **Queerness**\n\nThis session introduces various artistic approaches in deconstructing queer identities and bodies, mainly through selected case studies in digital and performance art. Students will be encouraged to compare these with discourses introduced during the last session, and discuss ways of decentering and expanding conventional feminist discourses.\n\n1. **Migration**\n\nIn this session, we will examine the concepts of mapping and displacements in the context of specific political and environmental crises. To do so, selections of contemporary gallery films by minority or immigrant artists will be screened, followed by a discussion.\n\n1. **Transculturality and Border Art**\n\nDrawing from transcultural studies and border studies, we will examine several media and performance art works as well as curatorial approaches that cope with cultural conflicts and hybridity. Selected case studies include *Magiciens de la terre* in Paris in 1989, the Whitney Biennale in New York, Asian Biennale in Taichung, and documenta Kassel.\n\n1. **Colonialism**\n\nThis session focuses on visual art creations that address natural resource extraction and indigenous rights issues. It will start with an introduction to primitivism in modern art, then move on to reactions to Imperialism in works by South-East Asian and African artists as new nation states and identities emerge.\n\n1. **Indigenous Art and Postcolonialism**\n\nWe will talk about First Nations land justice and reconciliation in this session. An institutional history of indigenous art will be covered first, then selected contemporary practices and their cultural representations under specific government policies. Particular attention will be given to discourses in Canada, Australia, and the New Zealand.\n\n1. **Environmentalism**\n\nThis session introduces discourses of eco-art and the Anthropocene. We will also draw from political ecology to discuss artistic approaches to environmental justice. Issues of community engagement and green washing will be attended.\n\n1. **Bio Art**\n\nThis session provides an overview on the history of bio art, its application in industries, the public reception, and the ethical issues.\n\n1. **Digital Capitalism**\n\nIn this session, we will look at artistic reflections on surveillance and digital capitalism through concrete examples. We will screen selected essay films that engages with data discrimination, surveillance infrastructure, and deepfake, followed by a discussion.\n\n1. **Asian Diaspora**\n\nIn this session, we will discuss the definitions of diaspora and the Sinophone through visual arts. We will look at artists outside of Mainland China who engage with “Chinese” identities differently. Works by such artists as Ian Cheng, Patty Chang, Musquiqui Chihying, and Lee Wen will be discussed.",

In this course, students will examine the emotional landscapes of contemporary China primarily through an anthropological lens while integrating insights from other disciplines such as history, cultural studies, sociology, and psychology. It explores how emotions are shaped by historical, economic, political, cultural, and social forces. By examining family life, social class, mental health, public performances of happiness, and digital interactions, students will gain insight into how emotions are constructed, expressed, and managed in various contexts. Through case studies, personal narratives, and ethnographic accounts, students will critically analyze how emotions like happiness, shame, bitterness, and depression intersect with broader social expectations and transformations. This exploration also invites students to reflect on their own emotional experiences and the cultural underpinnings that transcend academia, potentially influencing how they think about their own ways of being in the world.",

      "course_syllabus": "Week 1: Introduction to the Course: What is Emotion, After All?\n\n* This lecture will introduce the concept of emotion as well as its relevant concepts feeling and affect, and their relevance in the socio-political context of contemporary China. It will explore how emotions are both a result of and a response to China's rapid transformations over the decades.\n\nWeek 2: Emotions in Transition: A Historical and Cross-Cultural Perspective on Emotional Experiences in China\n\n* This lecture will examine the historical evolution of various emotions in China and explore how the same emotions may be understood and experienced both similarly and differently across other societies.\n\nWeek 3: Caregiving and the Politics of Paternalistic Emotions\n\n* This lecture will explore the emotional labor of caregiving in China, particularly how family caregivers navigate affective expectations and the paternalistic nature of state-society relations.\n\nWeek 4: “Why Family Hurts?”: The Moral Dimensions of Emotions at Home\n\n* This lecture will explore the emotional complexities within Chinese family life, focusing on how familial relationships can become sources of both emotional support and emotional pain. It will highlight the tension between personal emotional needs and the moral imperatives of familial duty, exploring why emotions in the family context can be particularly fraught.\n\nWeek 5: Bitterness and Endurance: Narrating Pain from Lives on the Margins\n\n* This lecture will explore the emotional experiences of rural migrants in urban China, focusing on the emotions of bitterness and endurance. It will examine how migrants navigate the emotional burdens of displacement, economic marginalization, and social exclusion, often unable to fully articulate their emotional suffering.\n\nWeek 6: Class, Modernity, and Emotional Reflexivity\n\n* This lecture will examine how emotions like shame and pride intersect with social class in contemporary China. It will explore the role of personal growth groups (e.g., self-help, therapy) in constructing new emotional norms for different social classes.\n\nWeek 7: Self-Development and the Emotional Economy of Purpose\n\n* This lecture will delve into the fluctuating emotions encountered in paths of self-development in China, focusing on the search for purpose and how feelings of deflation or emotional burnout are managed.\n\nWeek 8: Performing Social Expectations and the “Good Life”\n\n* This lecture will examine how happiness in contemporary China is often intertwined with the performance of social expectations using examples such as food and weddings. Both food and weddings illustrate how happiness in China is deeply connected to societal expectations, where individuals navigate the emotional pressures of aligning personal fulfillment with collective standards of success and well-being.\n\nWeek 9: Well-being in China's Mental Health Boom\n\n* This lecture will explore the rise of mental health services in China, known as the \"psy-boom,\" and how it reflects the growing societal focus on emotional well-being. It will examine the pathologization of emotions such as anxiety and depression, and how mental health interventions are reshaping perceptions of well-being in contemporary China.\n\nWeek 10: Understanding Depression in China: Cultural Contexts the Ethnography of Emotional Stress\n\n* This lecture will explore the complexities of understanding depression in China. It will focus on how depressive experiences in China are shaped by cultural, social, and historical factors. Students will critically engage with how these depressive experiences differ from Western biomedical models of mental health and why these cultural differences matter for diagnosis, treatment, and public health policies.\n\nWeek 11: Digital Emotions: Social Media, Online Communities, and Emotional Expression in China\n\n* This lecture will explore how digital platforms shape emotional expression and community-building in contemporary China. We will examine how social media provides outlets for emotions often suppressed offline and fosters online communities around shared experiences, such as mental health. The lecture will also address the emotional impact of digital surveillance and censorship, highlighting the evolving relationship between technology, emotion, and social control.\n\nWeek 12: Indifference, Silence, the Politics of Voice in China\n\n* Drawing on examples from everyday life, as well as state-citizen relations, the lecture will explore how emotions such as indifference and strategies of silence are used as coping mechanisms or forms of soft resistance.\n\nWeek 13: Course Wrap-up: Reflecting on Emotional Landscapes in China and Personal Reflections\n\n* This final lecture will revisit the diverse emotional landscapes explored throughout the course—ranging from family dynamics and social expectations to mental health and political silence—and discuss how these affect both individual well-being and collective identity. This last section will also encourage students to engage in personal reflexivity, considering how their own cultural backgrounds and emotional frameworks influence their understanding of the material.",

The so-called \"little\" traditions are different from the three \"great\" Chinese traditions: Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism. The \"little\" traditions are often known as popular religions or common religions. They represent the religious orientation of the majority of Chinese people. By expanding our horizon from globalized, highly abstract and univocal systems of thought to domestic localized oral and non-elite mentalities, we are striving to represent more accurately the heterogeneity of religious experience of Hong Kong people. Through the study of popular religions in Hong Kong, this course hopes to enrich students with a better understanding of both the structure and the dynamics of Hong Kong society as well as its local culture.",

      "description": "(UGEC2623 is double-coded with COMM2210.)  This course talks about the characteristics and functioning of news, and its important role and functions in society. News is vital to us as it brings latest information of the day, helps create public opinion, educate our young generations, monitor the government and the powerful, as well as provide relaxation to our busy lives. To understand the news can essentially help us know our society. Various concepts and theories from the mass communication discipline are introduced together with some perspectives from other social sciences. Real-life examples from Hong Kong and abroad are analyzed.Students are first introduced to the unique nature of news and different types of news as found in both print and electronic media. Some new news formats, including free dailies, online newspapers, network social media and citizen journalism, are discussed in both international and local contexts. Relationships between journalism and closely related professions such as advertising and public relations are explicated in order to understand the actual functioning of news, as well as its impact on society. The professional concerns of the field of journalism and individual’s news consumption habits are also highlighted in the course.After taking this course, students will be able to understand more about news and its relationship with the society. They should be able to critically evaluate news and social phenomena. It is hoped that they can become wise news consumers and well-informed citizens.",

      "course_syllabus": "The course consists of several parts. The first part sets the stage by examining the relationship between news and society, the nature and characteristics of news, as well as inviting students to reflect on their news reading habits. The second part deals with various major types of news, including social news, political news, entertainment news, and international news. The third part is about some emerging news trends in society, including the rapid rise of free newspapers, online newspapers and the new social network media as news channels. The final part discusses institutional relationships among news, advertising, public relations, and other social sectors. The reflection on journalistic professionalism and media ethics serve to round up and highlight the role and responsibilities of news in society.\n\nThe following is an outline of this course:\n\n* *Week 1 Introduction: News and Society**\n\nThe course starts by introducing the role of journalism as a vital social institution and its unique function as the often-quoted \"fourth estate\" of the government. But in fact news serves to monitor the government and the society, and thus freedom of the press is important not only to the journalists but to the general public. Contribution of newswork to the proper maintenance of the public sphere and establishment of a civil society is emphasized.\n\n* Key concepts: journalism as social institution, journalism as the fourth estate, press freedom, public sphere*\n\n* *Week 2 What is News: Characteristics and Perspectives**\n\nNews is a complex social phenomenon. It is so familiar to us but yet a simple and clear definition cannot be satisfactorily reached among academics and practitioners. Many agree that \"immediacy\", \"importance\" and \"interest\" are the three most important components. Others see news as some sort of deviant events. Some scholars regard news as vital social information while others think of it as a commercial product. Objectivity can be regarded as a noble ideal but some say it is a \"strategic ritual\". Scholars from the humanistic tradition would treat it primarily as a \"speech act\".\n\n* Key concepts: definitions of news, the three “Is” of news, news as deviance, objectivity as strategic ritual, news net, humanistic perspectives of news*\n\n* *Week 3 Cultivating Good News Reading Habits**\n\nNews consumption patterns were stable in the past but are now showing great changes due to the coming of the Internet age. People tend to read less print newspapers and spend more time getting information online. This is especially true for the younger generations who practically grow up together with the Internet. How can we instill the value of news reading to the young people? How can they become smarter readers, no matter which news venues/channels they tune to? New technologies are a threat to existing media but they also open up new opportunities and possibilities. It is essential for our students to be news literate in order to become an informed and critical citizen.\n\n* Key concepts: changing news use patterns, news consumer, critical citizenship, media education, technological impact*\n\n* *Week 4 Social News: Taste Strata of Mass and Elite**\n\nNews about the society can vary according to the orientations of news organizations and the tastes of the reading/viewing public. The elite class has different taste preference over news when compared with the mass public. Fierce competition and marketization have driven many news organizations to go down the road of tabloidization and McDonaldization. They tend to hype the news and respond more to market \"wants\" instead of social \"needs\".\n\n* Key concepts: tabloidization, McDonaldization, market driven-journalism, hyping*\n\n* *Week 5 Political News: Monitoring Those in Power**\n\nNews is always intertwined with the government, politicians and those who have power in society. Various political forces want to control or influence the press in order to gain advantages. They feed and spin stories to the media, which on the other hand try to play the watchdog function and report news responsibly. News coverage in election settings will be examined to see how journalists and politicians interact with each other, and whether the public is properly informed.\n\n* Key concepts: spin doctoring, watchdog function, social responsibility theory, media and election, stereotyping*\n\n* *Week 6 Entertainment News: \"Interesting\", Not \"Public Interest\"**\n\nSome people love entertainment news. They are keen on the \"interesting\" acts of or self-directed promotion by certain celebrities and have little concern over \"public interest\". As a result, entertainment news tends to be trivial or muckraking. The paparazzi teams sent by news organizations could not care less about invasion of privacy or damaging celebrities' reputations. The blurring of boundaries (between truth and falsehood, right and wrong, public and private, etc.) is something we should be aware of when reading this type of news.\n\n* Key concepts: trivialization, paparazzi, personal muckraking, blurring of boundaries, invasion of privacy*\n\n* *Week 7 International News: Our Window on the World**\n\nThe course will talk about international news as the world is getting more and more global and integrated. It is essentially our window to look at the world outside. Between nations, diplomacy is often done through news reporting, which significantly reflects national interests. The major international news agencies play an important role. Journalists usually try hard to \"domesticate\" foreign news to make it more attractive to local audience.\n\n* Key concepts: media and national interest, public policy, media diplomacy, domestication of news*\n\n* *Week 8 Free Newspapers: The New Model That Works**\n\nTraditionally, TV is free but newspaper is paid. But in the past few decades, paid TV channels have quickly emerged as well as free newspapers. Print newspapers rely on both advertising and subscription or single copy sales. This business model is upset by the free newspapers which rely solely on advertising. People find that being free is irresistible, and they are less concerned about the quantity and quality of news as long as it is free of charge. What are the implications for the future of journalism? Would it popularize newspaper reading or downgrade the quality of journalism, or both? How do free dailies, paid dailies and online dailies interact? These are evolving issues worthy of closer examination.\n\n* Key concepts: distribution-driven journalism, free vs. paid, Metro Daily formula, work-habitation patterns, interactions among different types of newspapers*\n\n* *Week 9 Online Newspapers: News in the Internet Age**\n\nGoing online is a relatively new phenomenon for the press starting in the mid-1990s. It began as a low-cost spin-off that carried big promises both in terms of revenue and readership. The actual result favors the latter but not the former, and the journalism industry is still seeking a workable business model for online newspapers. But online\n\nDailies do revolutionize news delivery and its content because of its electronic and digital format. A new marketplace is forged but its potential has not been fully realized. Whether online newspapers would eventually replace the print versions remains an intriguing question for both the academics and the practitioners.\n\n* Key concepts: electronic marketplace, information marketplace, opinion marketplace, virtual media space, media format*\n\n* *Week 10 Social Network Media as News Channels**\n\nIn the past decade, new social network media have become so popular that they also begin to act as news source and serve as a platform for news dissemination. What are their relationships with traditional news organizations? How do they affect the nature, delivery and quality of news? Scholars differentiate the role of traditional journalists as \"gatekeeping\" from the new role of online journalists as \"gatewatching\". Is citizen journalism in the Internet age a blessing or a curse? Would there be generational differences? All these questions will be explored in the course.\n\n* Key concepts: alternative media, Facebook, Twitter, blogging, citizen journalism, gatekeeping, gatewatching*\n\n* *Week 11 News and Advertising: Any Strings Attached with the Money?**\n\nNews and advertising seem to be inseparable worldwide. Journalists work together with advertising and marketing people to bring both news and product information to the readers/audiences. But the journalistic side and the market side of a news organization have different and even opposing ideals and goals. They are in constant battle but have to rely on the other for survival. How can news be immune from unwanted advertising influence? Why is public broadcasting possible but not public print journalism?\n\n* Key concepts: journalistic theory vs. market theory, theory of low involvement, types of advertising, commercialization, sponsorship*\n\n* *Week 12 News and Public Relations: How to Influence the Press**\n\nJournalists and public relations people constitute another pair of actors in constant tension and cooperation. Journalists need news sources and public relations practitioners provide news and information to news organizations. But public relations people are often accused of staging pseudo-events in order to gain publicity and propaganda. They try to influence the press and get coverage. In recent years, many journalists leave the profession and join the public relations field as they know how news work and how to gain press coverage. It is an interesting topic and has major implications for the content and quality of news reporting.\n\n* Key concepts: pseudo-events, staging, manufacturing consent, propaganda model*\n\n* *Week 13 Rethinking News: Professionalism, Ethics, and Alternatives**\n\nThis week is a wrap-up of the course by focusing on media professionalism and ethics. How can journalists do their job properly under all sorts of constraints? Can they adhere to a high standard of media ethics? Can news reflects different perspectives and interests in the society? Is the noble ideal of public journalism a viable alternative? How can news better serve our society and the general public? It is hoped that students will be able to reflect on these questions through the readings and the various assignments in this course.\n\n* Key concepts: journalistic professionalism, media ethics, multi-perspectival news, public journalism*",

We will review and discuss how various factors have contributed to the invention and development of communication fads.\n\n* *Week 3 Mediated memories: How we remember and are remembered?**\n\nCommunication technologies have been important memory devices in human history. We will trace how communication technologies co-evolved with memory practices.\n\n* *Week 4 Social media: How we connect and are connected?**\n\nWhat media are not “social media”? Media always facilitate networking in different forms. We will reconsider what differentiates the social media we know of today from previous generations of social media.\n\n* *Week 5 Dating apps and romance**\n\nThe meanings of ‘romance’ and ‘intimacy’ have undergone sweeping changes with the advent of dating apps in smartphones. In this class, we will examine the features of these apps and uncover their assumptions underlying ‘love’.\n\n* *Week 6 MOOC and learning**\n\nMassive Open Online Courses are introducing new forms of teaching, learning and academic accreditation. In a broader sense, how has Internet transformed learning? We will critically evaluate some popular claims in this aspect.\n\n* *Week 7 KOL and public opinions**\n\nKey Opinion Leaders are also known as social influencers or sometimes internet celebrities. They are seen to exert increasing influence in ‘public opinions’ or ‘public sentiments’.　In this class, we will revisit earlier communication theory regarding two-step flow of information and see how Internet has brought new practices in shaping public opinions.\n\n* *Week 8 Streaming media and entertainment**\n\nIn this class, we will focus on the case of streaming media and discuss how entertainment is changed in the Internet era. We will also consider how this in turn affects the production, distribution and consumption of media products.\n\n* *Week 9 - 10 Haters and comment culture**\n\nComment culture is a notable Internet phenomenon. Instead of looking at ‘likes’, we focus on the mechanisms behind ‘dislikes’ and the behaviors of ‘haters’.\n\n* *Week 11 Protest mobilization and social movements**\n\nInternet is seen to be a key factor in protest mobilization. We will examine some key elements in social movements and discuss how social media, for example, have contributed (or not) in the mobilization process.\n\n* *Week 12 Surveillance and sensor society**\n\nThe classic ‘big brother’ thesis is discussed with a careful consideration of many emerging practices in surveillance and self-surveillance. The idea of ‘sensor society’ will be introduced to see how we are (in)voluntarily contributing to a productive surveillance culture.\n\n* *Week 13 Hello future!**\n\nIn this final class, we will reconsider the two central themes of convergence and participation and make both informed and wild guesses for the future.",

This course studies the conditions for producing a particular set of media representation and how it perpetuates the current power structure. How the progressive ideas of sex and violence can enter the social realm of discussion through media representation will also be studied.\n\nThe course explores media representation as a powerful tool in perpetuating certain social reality in the following aspects: (1) it is additive to existing cultural values; (2) it supplements face-to-fact communication; and (3)the representation is monopolized (one-sided). The course also aims to sharpen students' sensitivity to the social reality that media representation of sex and violence as a commercial product is largely an outcome of the reliance of media organizations on advertising money as the funding source. In other words, the imperative of such media representation (a commercial product) is rooted in the particular socio-economic structures of commercial media organization.\n\nThe notion of \"power\" will also be studied in the following aspects: (1) it shapes our understanding of gender roles and \"just\" use of violence; (2) media organization is structurally more resourceful than the audience; (3)media representation of sex and violence is carefully constructed to appear as the \"normal\"/\"natural\"; and (4) the constructive nature of media representation is hidden.\n\n* *Topics**(subject to change by the instructor)\n\nIntroduction and getting to know each other\n\nMedia and Society\n\nWhat's wrong with advertising?\n\nAnything wrong with newspapers?\n\nAesthetics of violence and gender differences\n\nViolence at a distance\n\nSex Industry I-Sex Workers\n\nSex Industry 11-Pornography and Erotica\n\nBeauty is the beast?\n\nMen from Mars, Women from Venus?\n\nGender and Intimate Relationships\n\nWomen are no longer the weaker sex?",

      "description": "(UGEC2634 is double-coded with COMM2140.)  The course is designed around two major themes, namely media and social development in Mainland China since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. Using key concepts and theories from the political economy of media and developmental communication studies, it introduces students to different periods of media reform and social change from the era of Chairman Mao to the period of \"harmonious society\". Emphasis is attached to post-1989 media regulatory systems, media industrialization, and their influence on the meeting of such developmental goals as poverty alleviation, democratization, and communication empowerment.The course will examine Mainland China's key media sectors including the printing press (newspapers and magazines), film and broadcasting media (radio and TV), and new networked communication tools (Internet and mobile phone) as well as alternative social formations through Internet activism, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and transnational developmental projects. The course will identify and discuss several ongoing debates, and the ensuing actions, held by different stakeholders, including governmental officials, media producers, educators, activists, international agencies, and the general audiences. Wider implications to public policy will be identified. There will also be discussions of current affairs related to media and social development in the country.Students will be able to describe the key characteristics of contemporary Mainland Chinese media and their roles in facilitating or obstructing development towards the ideals of a \"new China\".",

      "course_syllabus": "The course consists of five main parts: (I) theories of media, communication and social development (week 1 and 2); (II) history of media transformation in Mainland China since 1949 (week 3 and 4); (III) key media sectors (week 5 to 7); (IV) social movements and campaigns (week 8 to 10); and (V) institutional stakeholders (week 11 and 12). In each part, there will be a mixture of conceptual and practical information, of consensus and controversies, and of historical knowledge and current affairs. The class will also look at different disadvantaged social groups and their relationship with various media sectors and stakeholders both within and outside officialdom.\n\nThe following is an outline of the course:\n\n* *Week 1 Introduction: Ideals of \"New China\"**\n\nThe first class will introduce students to (a) the pursuit of a \"New China\" that gave legitimacy to the rise of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) since the May Fourth Movement, and (b) classical theories of media and national development between 1950s and 1980s. It will also discuss the concept of 'social development' and give an overview of the course's core content.\n\n* Key concepts: \"New China\", nation building, communication and development*\n\n* *Week 2 Communist Media Theories: Political Control and Social Development**\n\nThis class discusses Leninist press theory, its evolution in the Chinese party-state, and the rationale behind this historical transformation, including politico-economic considerations as well as trends in cultural and technological change. Key ideas of the mass line and ICTD (information and communication technologies and development) will also be discussed in the case of rural development.\n\n* Key concepts: Leninist press theory, party-state, political control, the mass line, ICTD, rural development*\n\n* *Week 3 and 4 Past and Present**\n\nThese two classes differentiate media and social development in Mainland China into three historical periods: 1949-1978; 1978-1989; and 1989-date. What defines these periods? How are they different? Did previous periods pave the way for later trends of marketization and partial liberalization in the post-1989 era?\n\n* Key concepts: The Maoist era, pre-1989 media reform, post-1989 reform, marketization, partial liberalization*\n\n* *Weeks 5 to 7 Key Media Sectors**\n\nZooming into China's printing media (newspaper and magazines), film and broadcasting media (radio and TV), and new networked media (Internet and mobile phone), these three classes provide a sector-specific analysis of China's media systems and their contributions to meeting goals of social development. Issues of censorship and regulation will be introduced. Debates on the digital divide will also be discussed.\n\n* Key concepts: printing media, film, broadcasting media, networked media, censorship, regulation, digital divide*\n\n* *Weeks 8 to 10 Social Movements and Campaigns**\n\nThese three classes focus on official efforts to modernize China using traditional and new media channels as well as alternative communication empowerment projects such as those led by domestic labor NGOs, environmental groups, and transnational civil society players. Studies in minority-nationality regions and with regard to disadvantaged groups such as women will be discussed along with the official project of \"constructing new socialist countryside\".\n\n* Key concepts: \"constructing new socialist countryside\", activism, empowerment, feminist activism, environmental movement, minority nationalities, transnational civil society*\n\n* *Week 11 and 12 Institutional Stakeholders**\n\nWe will first return to China's media regulatory frameworks centered on the CCP's Central Propaganda Division (CPD) as well as several ministry-level governing bodies whose bureaucratic systems extend to lower levels of the party-state. Then in Week 12, we will look into China's journalism education system as another key institutional stakeholder. To what extent are the regulators and educators facilitating or hindering overall social development? Why? How could they do better? How could college students in Hong Kong play a meaningful role interacting with the stakeholders?\n\n* Key concepts: CPD, local state, media governance, journalism education, democratization*\n\n* *Week 13 Student Group Presentations and Course Wrap-Up**\n\nStudents will present their final projects in the last class, which will end with the instructor's wrap-up of the course.",

      "description": "(UGEC2636 is double-coded with COMM2813.) With the advent of the new media technology, new forms of organizational crisis emerge. They are called Internet-mediated crises. A major difference between the Internet-mediated crises and the traditional crises lies in the intensive interactivity, collectivity, simultaneity and dialogic sphericity of the former. This very nature of Internet-mediated crisis makes it all the more hard to handle. A specialized and critical function of the public relations practice is the management of crisis. This course covers two major levels. The first level takes on a functionalism approach to crisis management. The second level takes on a more critical approach in public relations. Students will learn how crisis reflects complicity and dynamism between citizens and organizations in modern societies. They will acquire an enhanced appreciation of communication that can be brought to bear in such crisis situations and a greater familiarity with the interactivity of an organization and its stakeholders as well as the environments in times of crises. They will also gain more sensitivity in public demands of socially responsible practices in the business contexts.",

      "course_syllabus": "The following is an outline of the course:\n\nWeek 1 Introduction: What is a crisis?\n\nThe course will begin with a question: “what is a crisis?” This is a fundamental question in crisis communication and management because failure in spotting a crisis (i.e., treating a crisis as a regular problem, or vice versa) may bring substantial internal and external threats to the organizations. Several crisis and non-crisis cases will be used for comparisons and discussions. At the end of the class, the students should be able to grasp the core characteristics of a crisis and the types of crisis commonly occurred in modern societies.\n\nKey concepts: Crisis vs. problem, types of crisis, crisis impacts\n\nWeek 2 The stakeholder theory and the four models of public relations\n\nThe class teaches Freeman (1984)’s stakeholder theory. It proffers the students an overview of the scope of the stakeholder groups that an organization may need to handle in crisis communication and communication. It then introduces Grunig and Hunt’s (1984) four models of public relations to give students a framework in viewing the relationships between organizations and stakeholders. Consequences of ignoring these relationships will be examined through the use of real crisis cases.\n\nKey concepts: The stakeholder theory, four models of public relations\n\nWeek 3 The public, the media and the new media\n\nThe class examines the evolution of the public demand and expectation on organizations in general and in times of crisis. The role of the media in shaping public opinion in crisis is also discussed. It also examines the impact of the advent of the new media technology on crisis communication and management. Online public forums on crisis cases will be studied.\n\nKey concepts: The critical mass, the media, the new media, the social media\n\nWeek 4 Blog-related crisis in modern societies.\n\nBlog-related crises include crises initiated or facilitated by personal blogs. The class examines rumor and fact types of blog-related crises. To demonstrate, several recent examples are used illustrate the huge impact of public comments on blogs. Factors that contribute to effective blog-related crisis management are discussed.\n\nKey concepts: blogs, word-of-mouth and blogosphere\n\nWeek 5 and 6 Pre-crisis planning\n\nThe class teaches a crucial stage in crisis management: Pre-crisis alert and planning.\n\nA good pre-crisis preparation may save an organization from a crisis. As such, students will be taught risk assessment, early detection and planning in the pre-crisis stage. Organizational structures and cultures that facilitate down-up reporting are necessary in early detection. Organizations that are particularly prone to crisis will be discussed. The importance of pre-crisis detection on the Internet and tools for monitoring will also be discussed.\n\nKey concepts: pre-crisis stage, crisis planning, risk assessment, organizational structures, organizational cultures\n\nWeek 7 and 8 Crisis communication and management\n\nBenoit’s (1995) image restoration theory and Coombs’ (1999) on-going crisis theory will be used to build theoretical frameworks in conceptualizing crisis communication and management. The class also examines the principles in making news to give students some guidelines about what to say and do in times of crisis, especially upon media enquiry. Good and bad examples of crisis communication management will be used for comparison and contrast.\n\nKey concepts: crisis communication and management, image restoration theory, ongoing crisis, the making of news\n\nWeek 9 and 10 Post-crisis communication\n\nPost-crisis communication is as important as crisis management because it determines how successful an organization is in restoring its image and reputation. It examines what is needed to be done for an organization to rebuild the lost trust. Several crisis cases will be used to investigate this topic. The students will explore on what constitutes a good post-crisis communication in this post-modern era.\n\nKey concepts: post-crisis communication\n\nWeek 11 Guest speaker\n\nAn expert in crisis communication and management will be invited to give a talk to students.\n\nWeek 12 and 13 Corporate social responsibility, sustainability and crisis\n\nThe concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) will be introduced. Cases showing the increased public demand on corporate social responsibility will be presented. The evolution of the concepts of CSR will also be discussed. The class will then examine the relationship between corporate social responsibility and pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis management.\n\nKey concepts: corporate social responsibility, business ethics",

Investigate beyond the seemingly superficial phenomenon created by advertising into deeper issues related to living attitude and social values.\n\n5. Develop a curiosity towards real life campaigns that promote meaningful causes that benefit citizens in Hong Kong.",
      "course_syllabus": "* *I. SUBLIMINAL PERSUASION**\n\n* *Week** **1****: Subliminal Messaging and** **Materialism**\n\nThis week will introduce briefly all three sections and emphasis more specifically on subliminal persuasion, using materialism, luxury branding in China as examples. China has replaced Japan as the second strongest economic power in the world in 2012. It has also surpassed the US to become the second largest luxury brand market in 2009, spending of $9.4 billion and accounting for 27.5% of total global sales of luxury brands in the world. The invasion of luxury brands will inevitably alter the spending culture in China. Luxury brand ads hint subtly that consumers using them belong to a higher social group in the society. Students will discuss the subliminal indicators of luxury brand ads and their effects on attitudes towards social status in the society.\n\n* *Week** **2****: Commercialization of Friendship in Social Networking Sites**\n\nSocial networking sites are dominating the media landscape among young people. Many viral ads are circulated through the disguise of sincere recommendations from friends, who actually share information for an incentive. This class will look into the core of this issue: should friendship be commercialized for personal gains?\n\n* *Week 3: Properties, Personal Loan Ads and Wealth**\n\nThe recent waves of glamorized Hong Kong properties ads disseminated in China led to grave consequences in raising the prices of flats in Hong Kong. The property ads In Hong Kong shape unrealistic desires in viewers to own a flat that demands a lifetime of hard earned salaries. Personal loan ads encourage a supposedly free life of spending with no responsibility. This lesson will discuss the dynamics of these subliminal messages in affecting one’s decision about how to spend his / her money.\n\n* *Week** **4****: Political Campaigns and Elections**\n\nThe presence of political campaigns in commercial media becomes prevalent these days due to the rise of democratization in the election process. This lesson will look into the various tactics and subliminal strategies used and manipulated in political advertising and its effects on public participation in election.\n\n* *II. MEDIATION OF REALITY**\n\n* *Week** **5****: Beauty Ads and Body Image**\n\nThis lesson will start with an in-depth look at the concept of mediation of reality, using studies conducted in Hong Kong that relate beauty and slimming product / service ads to a negative self-perceived body image in both men and women. Teenagers, in particular, are finding their self in their growing years by comparing themselves to the models in the ads. The gap between the idealized self and actual self creates frustrations among many. To bridge the gap, some fall for crash diets and some for desperate acts of plastic surgeries.\n\n* *Week** **6****: Stereotypical Sex Ads and Gender Roles**\n\nThis lesson looks into the relationship between commoditization and objectification of the body and the resultant stereotypical roles played by men and women. Students will be challenged to live beyond the fixed roles narrowly defined and presented in the pseudo-reality.\n\n* *Week** **7****: Tutor King / Queen Ads and Education**\n\nThe educational system in Hong Kong requires students to acquire incessant training and upgrading. Many tutors chanced this opportunity to create fast track learning to success by advertising their success rate of getting a student to obtain an As. This form of promotion alters students’ mentality to learning. Tutors acting as opinion leaders in ads create a trend of commercialized education.\n\n* *Week** **8**: **A “Copycat” Culture**\n\n“Copycat” China refers not only to the many cases of copying of products but also the imitation of ideas and other intellectual properties in China. Advertising is an industry that is keen on creativity, the very core element that sustains the industry. Piracy will suffocate the creative industry in the long run. Students will scan the creative landscape in China and learn to identify the seemingly original creative reality.\n\n* *III. INFUSION OF CONSTRUCTED MEANINGS**\n\n* *Week** **9****: Freedom of Speech and the Press**\n\nThis class will start examining the idea about meaning and value driven advertising/ advocacy. Recent cases show that advertising is affecting the press in Hong Kong and the Mainland has been censoring a lot of ads online and outdoor. What is the value of commercial speech? How much would the commercial speech be compromised? Will the censorship erode creativity, global branding strategy and business development? Students will investigate the longstanding struggle of the protection of speech in Hong Kong and the mainland.\n\n* *Week** **10****: Globalizing and Standardization**\n\nGlobal brands launched by global advertising agencies bring about their unique culture from the country-of-origin into a foreign country. For a global brand to be successfully adopted by local citizens, the agencies need to accommodate the traditional culture. However, the global influence for standardization sometimes surpasses localization, resulting in a pervasive infusion of foreign values. The balance and consideration of both cultures are the center of discussion in this lesson. A few global campaigns around the world will be presented to demonstrate the delicate balance between globalization and localization.\n\n* *Week 11: “Anti” Campaigns and Social Movements**\n\nThis lesson will look into the value-driven impact and of Public Service Announcements (PSAs), including the anti-smoking, anti-drug and anti-AIDS campaigns on society. The lesson will also focus on the development, planning and execution of those campaigns. It is the purpose of the lesson to raise the awareness of the students in these cause advertising campaigns.\n\n* *Week 12: Earth Hour, Outdoor Light Pollution and other Green Campaigns**\n\nGreenpeace and other environmental protection groups have been working on major campaigns to improve the living conditions of the world. A few successful green campaigns will be discussed in class to reveal their value shifting strategies.\n\n* *Week 1****3****: Food, Drug Ads and Public Health**\n\nWorld Health Organization has established the strong tie between advertising of high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) food and obesity. While UK has exercised blanket ban of food advertising to children and many other countries following suit, the Broadcasting Authority in Hong Kong has only advised five cases in the past four years regarding HFSS food ads to children. This lesson will investigate the difficult path to policy change in the business sector in Hong Kong. Advertising of all medicinal products in Hong Kong is strictly controlled by the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance (Cap 231) (the UMAO). Section 3 of the UMAO provides for an outright prohibition against the publication of 'any advertisement likely to lead to the use of any medicine … for the purpose of treating … or preventing' any disease, disorder or abnormal physical state. However, some prominent direct-to-consumer prescription drug ads are produced and broadcasted in Hong Kong recently. DTC drug advertising will change the traditional beliefs towards doctor-patient relationship and the demand of name-brand drugs at the expense of generic or equally effective drugs. Students will explore the Campaigns of Gardasil and Cervarix to find out their use of Government bodies as façade to lure the public to consult doctors about the drugs.",

      "description": "(UGEC2655 is double-coded with ANTH2324.) This course is an anthropological introduction to contemporary India, its social life and diverse cultures. India is home to more than a billion people, who look differently, speak various languages, practice different religions, and have distinct rituals, cuisines, and music. It is one of the world’s powers with global economic, political, and intellectual influence. Moreover, it shares important ties in the sphere of philosophy, religion, and medicine with China and other Asian societies. Therefore, students will learn about India’s place both in the world and the Asian region, including its ties with Hong Kong. Students will also develop an understanding of the country’s diversity and complex social phenomena such as kinship, communalism, caste system, tribe, third gender, and class. We will discuss pressing issues and theoretical debates related to globalization, sexuality, social movements, religious conflicts, public health, environment, and labor, and how these issues have been shaped by post-colonial politics and current transnational processes.",

Focusing on the work-place as 'working cultures', this course offers an anthropological perspective to understand how work is a matter of place, time, power, and meanings. We will further explore how current social, technological, and cultural transformations of work can be understood across places, in their historic continuities and disruptions. Each week the course analyzes, discusses, and rethinks a key concept in the anthropology of work: Class, time, race, gender, value, craft, ownership, creativity, autonomy, discipline, etc. Through reading contemporary ethnographies of different workplaces and circumstances, students will learn the analysis and theory of work in familiar or unexpected forms, as well as in different organizational settings from the office, factory, workshop, home, to online platforms. This course will further give the students the tools to systematically connect their own observations of work to writing about working cultures.",

      "required_readings": "* *Working Class I: Gender in the Global Factory**\n\nWork-places are social institutions that reproduce various relationships of society. By analyzing international technology hardware-production in Mexico, we will see how different ways of task organization, hiring practices, and promotion regimes shape gendered production as much as class and gender relations beyond the factory.\n\nSalzinger, Leslie. 2003. \"Chapter 1: Ways of Seeing\", \"Chapter 4: Bringing Fantasies to Life: Panoptimex\" + \"Chapter 5: Re-formulating the 'Traditional Mexican Woman': Particimex\". In: Genders in Production: Making Workers in Mexico's Global Factories. Berkeley: University of California Press.\n\n* *Working Class II: Race in Migration**\n\nFollowing high-skilled IT-workers from India to Berlin this ethnography explores how immaterial work in an office can be embodied and ascribed to race rather than skill. Understanding work and its hierarchies within transnational and local class aspirations and shifting racial stereotypes, we will explore the experience of work as both empowering and discriminatory.\n\nAmrute, Sareeta. 2016. \"Introduction: Cognitive Bodies, Cognitive Work (until p. 18)\", \"Chapter 2: The Postracial Body\". In: Encoding Race, Encoding Class. Indian IT Workers in Berlin. Durham: Duke University Press.\n\n* *Working Place and Space**\n\nAll work-places exist in multiples spaces from global markets, supply chains, nation-states, to cities. Through the case of women working the night shift in Mumbai's call-center industry, we will see how social mobility and the roles of women in relations of work, leisure, family, and self are impacted by social norms of who should work at night.\n\nPatel, Reena. 2010. \"Introduction (until p. 18)\", \"Chapter 4: Traveling at Night\". In: Working the Night Shift: Women in India's Call Center Industry. Stanford: Stanford University Press.\n\n* *Working Time**\n\nTime is crucial for structuring work and pay. Contemporary work often reorganizes time and new, flexible time regimes revolutionize our understanding of the work day. This week explores, on the one hand, time as valuable or wasted in the contemporary NGO-industry. On the other hand, we will look at time in terms of flexibility, autonomy, but also as source of anxiety for independent taxi drivers in New York.\n\nSheldon, Zachary. 2021. \"Managing the Humanitarian Workplace: Capitalist Social Time and Iraqi Refugees in the United States.\" In: Anthropology of Work Review 42 (1 ): 35- 46.\n\nOcchiuto, Nicolas. 2017. \"Investing in Independent Contract Work: The Significance of Schedule Control for Taxi Drivers\". In: Work and Occupations 44(3): 268 - 295.\n\n* *Working Self**\n\nWork is often not just a job, but a part of ourselves. But where are the boundaries between work as what we do or who we are? Through the case of sex workers in San Francisco, we will discuss themes of authenticity in customer relations, alienation, self-fulfilment, control, and abuse in service work.\n\nBernstein, Elizabeth. 2007. \"Chapter 4: The Privatization of Public Women\". In: Temporarily Yours - Intimacy, Authenticity, and the Commerce of Sex. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.\n\n* *Working Service**\n\nSimilar service work like taking care of people can take place in drastically different settings from someones house to a luxury hotel. While some workers perform their duties in public, others are confined to the domestic and intimate spaces of other people's living spaces. By contrasting the management of domestic helpers in Hong Kong with luxury hotel workers in San Francisco, we will think about how work discipline and evaluation influences performance, but also how the setting of work allows or prevents abuse.\n\nConstable, Nicole. 2017. \"Chapter 5: Household Rules and Relations.\" In: Maid to Order in Hong Kong: Stories of Migrant Workers. Ithaca: Cornell University Press.\n\nSherman, Rachel. 2007. \"Chapter 2: Managing Autonomy.\" In: Class Acts- Service and Inequality in Luxury Hotels. Berkeley: University of California Press.\n\n* *Working Craft**\n\nPractices and skill of work are often passed on, refined, and perfected through generations of practitioners. The skill of artisans and craft-workers has often been romanticized as traditional and pure. Through the reinvention of bartenders as highly skilled and creative makers in postindustrial New York, this week aims to understand how professions transform, become 'cool', and reinvent themselves.\n\nOcejo, Richard. 2017. “Introduction: A Stroll through the Market” + “Chapter 1: The Cocktail Renaissance”. In: R. Ocejo. Masters of Craft: Old Jobs in the New Urban Economy. Princeton: Princeton University Press.\n\n* *Working on Demand**\n\nWhat is creativity? What is a copy? Exploring the world of the now famous, hand-painting makers of oil painting reproductions in Dafen village, we will see what makes an artist or a worker, as well as the shifting boundary between copyrights and copy.\n\nWong, Winnie. 2014. \"Introduction: After the Copy (until p. 22)\" + \"Chapter 4: Step 18: 'Sign Vincent\"'[selections]. In: Van Gogh on Demand - China and the Readymade. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.\n\n* *Working Platforms**\n\nSocial media platforms drastically transform employment relationships, modes of contract and payment, but also meanings of profession and occupation. Through the online communities and marketplaces of game designers and car sharing drivers, we will see how work becomes more individualized or more embedded online.\n\nSchwartz, David. 2018. “Embedded in the Crowd: Creative Freelancers, Crowdsourced Work, and Occupational Community”. In: Work and Occupations 45 (3). Pp. 255-282.\n\nSurie, Aditi and Jyothi Koduganti. 2016. “The Emerging Nature of Work in Platform Economy: Companies in Bengaluru, India: The Case of Uber and Ola Cab Drivers”. In: International and Comparative Labour Studies 5(3): 1 – 30.\n\n* *Working for Free?**\n\nWhy do we work for free? Is that even possible? By looking at seemingly 'un-worklike' activities of women and promoters in the international party circuits, we ask how we can understand work beyond traditional relations of employment or exchange.\n\nMears, Ashley. 2020. \"Chapter 3: The Potlach\" + \"Chapter 4: Trafficking at Model Camp\". In: Very Important People - Status and Beauty in the Global Party Circuit. Princeton: Princeton University Press.\n\n* *Working Skill**\n\nWho has skills? What are skills? Understanding the complex social organization of building football stadiums in Qatar, this week explores how people know what to do if it has never been done before. We will further understand skill as embodied practice and matter of recognition.\n\nlskander, Natasha. 2021. \"Chapter 3: How Skill is Embodied ... \". In: Does Skill Make Us Human? Migrant Workers in 21st Century Qatar and Beyond. Princeton: Princeton University Press.\n\n* *Working Capitalism**\n\nIs all work productive? Is all work meaningful? Through this critique of contemporary capitalism as unproductive system, we will discuss the meaning of work and how to imagine new work practices in the future.\n\nGraeber, David. 2018. \"Chapter 1: What is a Bullshit Job\" + \"Chapter 4: What is it like to have a Bullshit Job?\". Bullshit Jobs -A Theory. New York: Anholt & Schuster. Selections.",

      "description": "(UGEC2657 is double-coded with ANTH2327.) This course provides an introduction to contemporary Japanese society and culture. In the popular imagination, Japan occupies a complex and often contradictory position. It is home to futuristic anime and an aging population, picturesque villages and dolphin hunts, high-end cameras and the widespread use of quaint fax machines. Engaging with anthropological literature, students will learn to analyze, discuss, and write about various issues and cultural features of Japan, including youth, popular culture, self, family, labor, medicine, and health. An overarching theme will be how Japanese culture and society is changing in the transition to a highly aged society. We will examine persistent cultural patterns as well as the emergence of new forms of social life as residents of Japan grapple with smaller families, precarity, migration, and a rising population of older people. Students will learn how to apply theoretical concepts from anthropology and think critically about Japanese culture and its portrayals in the media. The ethnographic approaches and theoretical perspectives covered in this class will be applicable to other cultural contexts. Since Hong Kong, China, and Korea are following Japan’s path of population aging, this course provides an opportunity to explore cultural issues that have a local and regional significance.",

      "description": "(UGEC2662 is double-coded with ANTH2510.)  Culture is ubiquitous in every aspect of societies, including how we do business. This course will examine the role of culture in contemporary business and study work and management in industrial societies anthropologically. Students will be introduced to the cultural logics of business practices, particularly business operations, organization and management through ethnographic explorations of different cultures, locales and sociohistorical settings. The aims of the course are twofold. First, it reveals cultural aspects and the cultural mechanisms of business. It shows the significance of culture in the business world, as well as the cultural significance of business. Second, it attempts to put anthropology into business practice. It demonstrates to students how anthropological knowledge and methodologies can be applied to business operations and help to achieve business goals. By examining the themes including but not limited to the indoctrination of work ethics, labor relations, gender and racial issues in the workplace, capitalism and its discontents, and responses to and actions upon market capitalism in terms of both production and consumption, the course attends to these Sustainable Development Goals: No Poverty (SDG#1), Gender Equality (SDG#5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG#10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG#17).",

      "course_syllabus": "The course is structured in three parts. *Part I Culture in Business* explores the cultural dimensions of workplaces and corporate management. We begin with an overview of the temporal and spatial reconfigurations since industrialization in order to discern modern work ethics, followed by explorations of dynamics in the workplace. Next, we will explore discourses in shaping corporate operations and management, and consider (and challenge) the ideas of economization, maximization, auditing and accountability. This part decodes life in business settings, and practices in corporations. *Part II Business Ventures in the Globalizing World* situates the discussions in current trends of capitalism. We will look into what makes us buy and spend, and how traditional values and modern business practices mingle. It raises the question of whether we are really emancipated under the fashion of decentralization by exploring the gig economy and the phenomenon of self-enterprising. We will also examine how we can build a more inclusive, diverse and equal society by finding a new way out from the existing business ideologies and practices. *Part III Anthropology and the Business World* discusses how to apply anthropology in business settings, looking into how and why anthropology and anthropologists are important to the private sector, and broadly speaking, to the modern capitalist world. The course concludes by contemplating whether business is really business.\n\nOverall, through the examinations of how we are taught to work, produce, and buy, the imperative of gender and racial stereotypes in the workplace, turns in capitalism and the rise of new economies and the pertinent social and cultural phenomena, the course addresses the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): No Poverty (SDG#1), Gender Equality (SDG#5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG#10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG#17).\n\n* *Core topics:**\n\nWeek 1 Course Introduction\n\nWeek 2 Seeing Business Anthropologically **(SDGs 17)**\n\n* *Part I Culture in Business**\n\nWeek 3 Space, Time and Work Ethics **(SDGs 8, 10)**\n\nWeek 4 Gender, Race/Ethnicity, and Communication in the Workplace **(SDGs 5, 8, 10)**\n\nWeek 5 Corporatization, Economization and Maximization **(SDGs 1, 8, 10, 12)**\n\nWeek 6 Audit Culture and Accountability **(SDGs 8)**\n\nWeek 7 Mid-term Test\n\n* *Part II Business Ventures in the Globalizing World**\n\nWeek 8 The Making of Consumers **(SDGs 10, 12)**\n\nWeek 9 Fieldtrip to a Social Enterprise/ a Social Innovation Project/ an exhibition about reindustrialization in Hong Kong\n\nWeek 10 The Gig Economy and Self-enterprising **(SDGs 1, 8, 10)**\n\nWeek 11 Ethical-Political Consumerism and Social Entrepreneurialism **(SDGs 1, 5, 8, 10, 12, 17)**\n\n* *Part III Anthropology and the Business World**\n\nWeek 12 Applying Anthropology to Business Practice **(SDGs 10, 17)**\n\nWeek 13 Conclusion: Is Business Really Business?",

Sports are often thought of as trivial, or as unimportant games to amuse young people. But in the wealthiest countries, sports represent huge portions of GDP and are important topics of daily conversation. Almost half the world watched the 2010 football/soccer World Cup. Sports have been compared to religions in their ability to unite people and to inspire fanatical devotion.The academic study of sports is interdisciplinary, with contributions from psychologists, historians, gender studies scholars, sociologists and anthropologists. This course will take an interdisciplinary approach while emphasizing anthropology’s focus on culture, on the experience of participants, and on both symbolic and political-economy aspects of sports. Topics will include Race and Performance, Sports and Rituals, Sports as Moral Education, Gender and Sexuality in Sport, Sports and Nationalism, Globalization of Sport, the Olympics, and Sports Stars and the Media.

      "description": "(UGEC2665 is double-coded with ANTH2540.) This course addresses the ways in which social media and other related interactions in cyberspace have become a central element in the everyday lives of humans across the globe in the 21st Century. Our modern lives are now largely interwoven with digital technologies that have not only changed our own cultures, but also have brought forth new cultural forms through mobile phone technologies, networked “smart”-products, and cultural groupings only possible through digital means. The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes—the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives. The role of anthropology in understanding and capturing human culture in this context anchors on the investigation of how technology is possibly making us ‘more’ human than previous forms of cultural life.",

This course introduces undergraduate students to the key concepts, theoretical frameworks, and main political discussions/reflections related to globalization. Globalization itself is introduced in a broad sense not limited by the economic aspect but a common experience of social change. For example, global environmental challenges, the common threat of nuclear crisis, the controversy between sovereignty and human rights, and the North-South divide. With both the historical and thematic perspectives, the class engages students with most recent research and debate on the topic. On the one hand, the class encourages students to relate their own experiences and observations in their own societies to digest what globalization is and what its impacts are. On the other hand, it also leads them to reflect on politics and social development in their own societies, in the context of globalization.",

      "description": "This course explores some of the major issues concerning the role of the youth and the problems confronting them in modern society. The nature of the conventional wisdom of the “youth problem” is critically examined, with the help of concepts and theories in sociology and related fields. By the end of the course, students are expected to gain more understanding of the nature of the phenomenon of problematization of youth, and to look beyond common sense or public perception on current social issues related to the youth in modern society. More importantly, youth problems can jeopardize the sustainable development of youth. [For example, education inequality (SDG4 Quality Education) and inadequate school-to-work transition (SDG8 Decent Work and Economic Growth) could impact on youth poverty (SDG1 No Poverty) as a result.] A broader and deeper understanding of various facets of problematization can inform how youth should be empowered to attain sustainable development in modern society.",

      "course_syllabus": "The core content of the course covers five areas in the study of youth problem.\n\n1. The developmental discourse and the concept of social construction are examined to illustrate the emergence and the nature of the youth concept.\n\n1. Biological, psychological and sociological views on the conceptualization of youth problem are introduced and compared, so as to illustrate the role and focus of social science, sociology in particular, in the study of youth problem.\n\n1. Specific youth topics such as (1) educational inequality (SDG1 No poverty, SDG4 Quality Education), (2) precarious school-to-work transition and downward mobility (SDG1 No poverty, SDG8 Decent work and economic growth), (3) youth gangs and violence (SDG3 Good health and well-being), (4) exceptionalism and gender inequality (SDG5 Gender equality), (5) dating aggression and sexual health (SDG3 Good health and well-being, SDG5 Gender equality), (6) resistance of sexual minorities (SDG5 Gender equality); (7) digital media challenges (e.g. infodemics, SDG3 Good health and well-being), and (8) normalization of risk behaviors (e.g. addictions, SDG3 Good health and well-being), are explored to scrutinize the forms and the extent of problem encountered by youth in modern society.\n\n1. Sociological concepts and perspectives, such as rational choice theory, social stratification theory, feminism, subcultural theory,, media theories, and labeling perspective, are discussed to illuminate the social factors affecting the above-mentioned youth problems.\n\n1. Postmodern perspectives and concepts, such as post-Fordism, post-materialism; risk society, risk assessment and individualization, are introduced to move beyond the modernity view and to offer a discussion on the recent emergence of new forms of social transformation and crisis faced by youth.",

      "description": "This course examines the social issues of animal from the philosophical perspectives. What are the key differences humans and other animals? Is it ethical to raise and slaughter animals for food, conduct tests on, and buying or keeping animals as pets? How ought one to respond to unethical laws on animals? What are the social impacts of these actions? Students will develop an interdisciplinary perspective in the fields of animal studies, ethical theory, sociology and environmental philosophy by understanding how ancient and contemporary philosophers, sociologist, environmental scientists, ecologists, activists, and journalists have responded to key ethical questions concerning animal rights and its social implication. Topics to be discussed include: animal-machines, ethical meat eating, radical vegetarianism, and the evolution of pets.This course bears on several of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By transforming our attitude towards and relationship with animal, we enjoy the mental health benefits of a deepened appreciation of and connection with them (SDG#3 Good Health and Well-Being). By exploring the key difference between human and animals, we deepen our understand toward ourself and different species on earth (SDG#14 Life below water & SDG#15 Life on land). Finally, by reimagining our relationship with animal, we can envision for a just society in which all species could co-exist peacefully (SDG#16 Peace, Justice and Strong institutions).",

      "description": "When money is fiat, land is scarce, housing becomes a good hedge of inflation. However, when housing is both an investment capital as well as a necessity, the city is split into an owner-renter dichotomy, with the former preferring an increase of housing prices but just the opposite for the latter. When the pendulum of housing price swings to one side, housing capital can result in negative equity, asset bubble, or even financial crisis. Swinging to the other end, housing can become unaffordable, even if public housing or subsidy can be provided. Decent living environment and sustainable community are the concerns of cities. This introduction course explores the reasons of the housing price fluctuations and the implications of the dichotomy on the city lives.",

      "description": "(UGEC2917 is double-coded with URSP2010.)  The Belt and Road initiative (BRI) refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. It is a significant development strategy proposed by the Chinese Government spanning approximately 60 countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, with a total population of 4.4 billion. This initiative takes advantage of global transportation routes, core cities, and key ports to build international economic co-operation corridors. The effective operation and management of the BRI require collaboration among a broad range of disciplines comprising civil engineering, material science, government operations, economics and finance, social and political science, and environmental science. A critical and multi-disciplinary understanding of the BRI can provide insights into basic requirements, geopolitical impact, physical barriers, and sustainability potential of the infrastructural projects it proposes to undertake and help relevant stakeholders address large-scale and complex challenges in the lifecycle management of those infrastructure projects. This course involves forward-looking perspectives to assess, predict, influence and enhance the in/direct network effects and benefits of the BRI on the cities, urban systems and peoples of the Belt and Road region.",

How, for example, does one language community interacts with another language community in the multilingual world? Does language change and what are the processes involved? To what extent does the same language vary due to gender, power, status, and identity? How do men and women, people with higher and lower social status talk differently? How are these relationships reflected in the use of politeness markers and other linguistic devices? What are the implications of sociolinguistics on education and language planning? Through introducing students to major issues in sociolinguistic studies, students will be able to develop a better understanding of how language functions in societal contexts from a linguistic perspective. Discussions will also focus on common sociolinguistic phenomena in daily communication, with a specific emphasis on the use of various languages and dialects spoken in Hong Kong. Exploring these topics will enhance students’ awareness of language as a cultural phenomenon and sharpen their sensitivity to the nuances of language use in the context of a multilingual world, with special reference to the sociolinguistic context of the Greater China area.",

      "description": "In this course, we will discuss the direct and indirect health consequences related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations and analyze the wider socioeconomic dimensions of these topics. After the pandemic we faced, we realized that a health crisis will have implications beyond the health sector and development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. It is therefore important for us, as global citizens, to recognize the issues related and understand how we can take part in this. Traditionally, health indicators have been an important aspect of development indices and health is a foundation of societies. Therefore, our course aims to discuss SDGs through the lens of health, by providing an overview on how the current global challenges on sustainable development impacts the population health and encourage students to look for solutions. We will cover the health-related SDGs by blended learning, including 2. Zero Hunger where we will discuss malnutrition, 3. Good Health and Well-being where we will discuss road injuries, infrastructure and management, 5. Gender Equality where we will discuss intimate partner violence, 6. Clean Water and Sanitation where we will discuss water safety and supply, 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth where we will discuss labor rights and occupational injuries, 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities where we will discuss impacts on health, socioeconomics and environment of inadequate housing and poor living environment, 13. Climate Action where we will discuss Climate-related disasters and disaster risks, and 16. Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions where we will discuss concept and impact of peace and justice on health. Through face-to-face tutorials and case-based discussions, we will discuss selected topics in greater details, including the road safety aspects of Goal 3 “Good health and well-being”, the protection of workers from work-related injuries in Goal 8 “Decent work and economic growth”, the disaster risks in modern developments in Goal 13 “Climate action”, and how to educate the younger generation on the promotion of peace in Goal 16 “Peace, justice and strong institutions”. Development of modern societies and the interaction between humans and environment will be discussed, and through the advocacy framework we will discuss the current challenges related which draw immense global attention, and allow students to exchange interdisciplinary ideas, identify the challenges we are facing and propose advocacy campaign in hope to identify and deliver solutions locally and internationally.",

It firstly introduces the basic knowledge of Islam and Islamic culture worldwide; and the prominent cultural and social position of Islam in the contemporary globalised world. It then applies Hong Kong as a case study to examine the historical evolution of various Muslim communities of Hong Kong, such as Indian, Pakantsian, Indonesian, African and Chinese Muslim communities. It also discusses how these Muslim communities interfaced with each other and integrated with the local society. By establishing a more inclusive and diversified understanding of the local Muslim community, this course responds to the UN Sustainable Development Goals #11 'Sustainable Cities and Communities. Meanwhile, it pinpoints local Muslim communities' challenges in the current globalised world. Islam is one of the most important religions in the contemporary world, which is also a key to achieving a safe and peaceful global environment; therefore, this course also echoes the UN Sustainable Development Goals #16 'Reduced Inequalities'.",

This course applies Hong Kong as a case study to explore the conceptualisation of heritage in Hong Kong's historical context; and the historical development of Hong Kong's cultural heritage policy framework, Including its limitations and effectiveness. This course covers tangible (historical structures) and intangible heritage in Hong Kong. Through fieldwork study and intangible heritage workshop, it aims to help students understand the conservation and revitalisation of Hong Kong's heritage and its substantial social role in local society. Through investigating various local examples in Hong Kong, this course further debates the importance of cultural heritage in terms of local community building and reconstruction of historical discourses. Furthermore, it investigates how various local cultural heritage sites interact and engage with their neighbouring landscape. Students are also encouraged to examine the tensions between urban development and cultural heritage conservation in Hong Kong.This course motivates the students to investigate the dynamic between cultural heritage conservation and sustainable urban development by using their local experience and exploring possible solutions to associated challenges.

      "description": "(UGEC2950 is double-coded with ANTH2380.)  This course pays attention to the environment and its relation with human experiences. Through the lens of environment, we bring human diversity into presence, examining ways of life of peoples—from Indonesia highlander to Tokyo urbanites—and their words and deeds to tackle crises of planetary scale—climate change, nuclear disaster, air pollution, waste, deforestation. Facing these crises, can anthropological inquiry of the environment help us to explore a humanity that can accommodate living beings of all kind? How can such inquiry inspire us to make changes that create a world we can live together? We’ll follow these trails in the environment to look for engagement and conversation: cultural perception on the origin of agriculture, resource use and religious belief, debating traditional ecological knowledge, globalization and state intervention, environmental justice, land dispossession, waste and pollution, disaster and extreme environment. Through ethnographies of people who are struggling to survive, this course asks why they are pushed into poverty, how their resources being exploited, what they do to fight for justice; it covers SDGs related to the issues of sustainable agriculture (SDG2), tacking climate change (SDG13) and promoting peace, justice and institutional accountability (SDG16).",

The role of myth in modern society and the cultural creation of reality will be highlighted. The power of a cultural approach in explaining the supernatural and the limits of what science can explain will also be discussed.",

Students enrolled in this cross-disciplinary course will address three basic questions: “why do people become criminals”, “who makes criminal law”, and “how is criminal law enforced”. Specifically, this course will include topics such as the social causes of criminal behaviour, the role of criminal law in social control, and the operation of the criminal justice system (their internal interaction and external interaction with other social organizations). Comparative and local empirical research will also be drawn to explore the crime problems and the development of criminal law and the criminal justice system in USA, PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In addition, to strengthen the students’ understandings on the current criminal justice system, students will be given one field opportunity to directly experience police departments, courts or prisons in Hong Kong.",

      "description": "(UGEC2990 is double-coded with ANTH2520.)  Globalization is economically transforming the world, as national borders become increasingly irrelevant before the global flow of money and goods. But globalization also has a great impact on cultures across the globe, as products from Coca-Cola to iPods, and ideas from human rights to ideals of beauty to ideologies of terrorism, intrude everywhere. This course examines how globalization is fundamentally transforming the meanings of culture. The course objectives are to enable students: (1) to have greater insight into the processes of “the globalization of culture\"”, and (2) to better understand the nature of their own culture and selves within a globalizing world.",

      "description": "Health is a fundamental aspect of human existence. We all want good health, effective treatments of illness and affordable health care. Yet we are faced with many challenges and controversies in our pursuit of good health: glaring inequality in health and longevity, the prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle, the conflicts between patients and doctors, the uncertainty of medical treatments and medical knowledge, and the ever-increasing health care spending. In this course, we dissect these issues from the perspectives of social sciences. We first assess the social determinants of health and illness and examine the following topics: the social distribution of health and illness, societal inequality and health, social networks, social capital and health, health lifestyle and public policy, and the interaction between genetics and social environment. We then address the social organization of health and health care and discuss the following topics: the social construction of health and illness, the social context of patient-doctor relationship, and the social organization of healthcare systems. Throughout the course, we will emphasize the current COVID-19 pandemic and use it to illustrate how social and cultural factors influence health and well-being. This course helps the students understand and relate to the following UN sustainable development goals: SDG#3 good health and well-being, SDG#10 reduced inequalities and peace, SDG#16 justice and strong institutions. By illuminating the social and cultural determinants of health and well-being, this course will enrich the students’ understanding of what contributed to good health and well-being, of the unequal distribution of health and well-being, and of the role of social and political institutions in producing health. It also seeks to motivate the students to think about public policies and social interventions that may promote health and well-being, reduce social disparities in health and strengthen health-promoting institutions.

The course will help students to understand issues of discrimination against women and girls, unpaid care and domestic work, access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and equal rights to economic resources, and to reflect on how to promote gender equality (SDG5 among 17 Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs, in the 2030 development agenda). Students will be encouraged to explore localized knowledge and living experiences of gender and sexuality, and to think critically about how to reduce inequality (SDG10) related to social systems of sex and gender.",

      "description": "(UGEC3204 is double-coded with GDRS3006.)  Living Feminisms is all about how to put feminism into practice. Specifically, it is concerned with living out feminist consciousness in every step of making fundamental and lasting social change. With this in mind, Living Feminisms is not an exposition of feminist theories per se but an exploration of how social change effort would look like when we take up feminist consciousness that transcends separateness and duality. It explores the root causes that lead to the domination system that has plagued humanity for centuries, examines the possibility of having a fundamental and lasting social transformation that supports life of all, and takes a closer look at a few selected alternative practices such as restorative justice and sharing economies that hold out hope in times of crises. The course also equips students with practical knowledge of being a change agent, introducing some practices with feminist consciousness that transform limiting beliefs about social change, nourish resilience by taking care of social and political trauma, and cultivate need-based facilitation skills and leadership that help navigate conflicts in the process of making internal as well as external transformation. To put it in a nutshell, Living Feminisms is a course that cultivates change agents with feminist consciousness.Living Feminisms deeply resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint for building a sustainable future by 2030. The course directly touches on alternative practices working towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).",

Specifically, they will be able to explain the roots of the domination system and a series of factors contributing to its perpetuation, and able to make change by transforming internal and external resistance. Students will be empowered to take lead in change effort through collaboration with others and mastery of conflict transformation skills. Students will learn to appreciate making a sustainable future requires transformation in areas broader than the conventionally defined economic realm.",
      "course_syllabus": "* *Class 1: How We Got Where We Are and Where Are We Heading?**\n\n·Riane Eisler and Douglas P. Fry’s biocultural approach that explains the perpetuation of domination systems through the interaction between genes, brain development and culture, and points to ways where hope lies\n\n* *Class 2: How Change Happens? A Lesson from Feminists**\n\n·Investigating over 100 organizations in 15-year longitudinal research, Aruna Rao et al. develop a model of change that sheds lights on the mechanism of social transformation\n\n·Cristina Bicchieri’s work delves into the formation and change of norms\n\n* *Class 3: What Makes Things Stuck? Inaction Explained**\n\n·How can we explain inaction of people witnessing immense suffering of others? Is the notion of false consciousness adequate? Joanna Macy, a Buddhist scholar and a veteran environmentalist, offers us some glimpse\n\n* *Class 4: *Practice*: Retelling a New Story and Reconnecting to Life that We All Share**\n\n·Understanding the impact of separateness at cognitive level is important but far from complete, Sharif Abdullah and Gretchen Ki Steidle offer us some practical advice on healing the deep-seated separateness by retelling a new story about human beings that fosters interdependence\n\n* *Class 5: Taking Action: Violent or Nonviolent or Both?**\n\n·Taking action to initiate change at various levels of a society is commonplace for activists. What is important is the kinds of action we undertake What is nonviolence? How does it work? What are its limits?\n\n* *Class 6: Social Trauma and Social Transformation**\n\n·Trauma is an overwhelming experience that outweighs the containing capacity of our nervous system How does trauma relate to and shape our political behaviors? Rather individualizing trauma as a single person experiences, how can we theorize collective trauma?\n\n* *Class 7: *Practice*: Self-Care & Inner Resources**\n\n·Change agents are prone to feel despair, powerlessness and hopelessness because they are more acutely aware of the enormity of suffering How to nourish our heart to make it open to pain and suffering while keeping the passion alive?\n\n* *Class 8: Reconciliation and Justice: Exploring Transitional Justice**\n\n·Common collective responses to atrocities are either forgetting or vengeance. Is transitional justice a viable third way? How does it work? What are the experiences of the 40 Truth and Reconciliation Commissions that have ever set up in human history can tell us?\n\n* *Class 9: Sexual Violence: Exploring Restorative Justice**\n\n·Our current justice system is a kind of retribution that punishes those who violate the law. How does it look like if we shift from retribution to restoration that focuses on needs and rebuilding of broken relationships? How controversial is it when applying to sexual violence?\n\n* *Class 10: Collaboration and Feminist Leadership: Coming to Terms with Power**\n\n·Activism often entails working with others. Is power necessarily evil? How does feminist leadership look like? How can we consciously use power in a way that does not subjugate but empower others? How can we replace power-over with power-with, power-to and power-within? Power-cube analysis\n\n* *Class 11: Alternative Organizing - Holacracy, Sociocracy and Deep Democracy**\n\n·There are always implicit agreements as to how to make decisions, define the nature and the scope of a task, evaluate outcome, and handle conflicts if we do not consciously decide how and what to decide\n\n·Quite a many grassroots organizations have been experimenting with new ways of organizing that is more efficient than representative democracy in meeting the needs of all. These alternative forms of governance include Holacracy, Sociocracy and Deep Democracy.\n\n* *Class 12: *Practice*: Workshop on Convergent Facilitation**\n\n·Convergent facilitation, developed by the feminist Miki Kashtan, a form of facilitation that caters for both willingness and efficiency in order to come up an agreement, decision and/or concrete strategies that maximally work for the needs of all within a group. The workshop will cover the whole process from the start to the end convergent facilitation is a proven one as it was applied to a group who disagreed with each other about legalization of abortion\n\n* *Class 13: Beyond Neoliberalism? Sharing Economy**\n\n·Our current economies are profit-driven that more often than not serves a few but exploits most of other people Is it really hopeless to revise capitalism? Is Sharing Economy a viable alternative?\n\n* *Class 14: Conflict Transformation: From the Personal to the International**\n\nDisagreements and conflicts among activists are commonplace. However, acquiring ways of resolving and transforming conflicts within groups is a skill that is urgently needed but seldom given enough attention this last lecture will touch on conflict resolution and mediation.",

The key questions are: How/Why/What/When innovation(s) are gendered? We will discuss the fluidity and messiness of doing and undoing gender in innovation practices and meanings produced. Broadly defined, innovation refers to new ideas, new knowledge, new technologies, new designs, and creative practices with the goal to solve social or technical problems. Many innovations may seem gender-neutral but are inherently imbued with gender perceptions. The course will equip students with ways to apply gender analysis to decipher innovations and innovative processes. The course incorporates sustainable development goals (SDGs) on Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities to become more discerning toward more sustainable practices to advance Industry Innovation and Infrastructure. Using case studies from the technology culture, the routine practices, and the emergent new economy, students will learn to untangle how gender intersects with the seemingly neutral artefacts of innovation and technology. The course further covers how emergent issues of diversity and inclusion, AI and information technology, social entrepreneurship and social innovation, and leadership style could reshape the existing relationship between gender and innovation to advance sustainability and social resilience.",

      "description": "(UGEC3214 is double-coded with GDRS3026.) This course examines the rich tradition of feminist film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates. Topics will include the key semiotic and psychoanalytic approaches of the 1970s-1990s, classic films which have inspired feminist debate, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, independent cinema, and postmodern cinema, as well as recent cinematic re-conceptualizations and exploration of gender and sexuality local and abroad. In systems of representation from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, women have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object “to-be-looked-at,” in Laura Mulvey’s now often quoted words. Following her trail, feminist critics turned their attention to mainstream films and popular media addressed to female spectators and exposed the contradictions within and between the notion of “women’s pictures” and the diversity of female experience. Local cinemas and independent creators also tell their own unique stories of women’s lives in dramatically different cultural contexts. Critics from other fields further complicate these images by examining them through lens including race, class, ability, queerness, and more.Mulvey’s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the place of women as spectacle or passive object in films “cut to the measure of [male] desire.” Critics around the world showed how different groups of women attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. What happens when female-identified artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? This course starts with the paradigm of narrative film analysis that Mulvey outlined in the 1970s and move on to explore a wider range of questions in feminist film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, (g)local cinema, and new feminist media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by female filmmakers worldwide, special focus will be placed onto important works in Hong Kong cinema for critical examination and comparative studies. Through critical reflections on notions such as gender stereotypes, representation, power, diversity, and equality, the course engages directly with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).",

      "description": "(UGEC3215 is double-coded with GDRS3214.)  How do we understand the notion of “minority”? And how does “minority”, look like, in cinema? This course examines the rich tradition of critical film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates, concerning “minority” identities and subalternity. Addressing key discussions about media representations of “minority”, the course will look at the politics of representation and its impacts, both on- and off-screen. We will be looking at how media works to construct “the Other” in different contexts, and delve into important work which have inspired minority cinema, subaltern cinema, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, and independent cinema among other counter-movements, as well as recent re-conceptualizations and exploration of representations marginalized identities, positions, and experiences, local and abroad. Across different systems of representation, from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, different groups, especially marginalized ones with little access to the mechanisms of production, have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object “to-be-looked-at,” in critical film theorist Laura Mulvey’s now often quoted words. Lacking representations both behind the camera and in front of it, how are the lives of different social “minorities” affected by biased media representations? How are stereotypes and biases created, disseminated, perpetuated, and reproduced through media, and to what consequences? Mulvey’s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the standings of different socially and culturally marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities, queer communities, and people with disabilities, etc., as spectacle or passive object “in films cut to the measure of desire” of the dominant social groups.What happens when “minority” artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? Critics showed how different marginalized groups around the world attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. Minority cinemas and independent creators have been actively carving out space to tell their own unique stories of lives at the margin in dramatically different cultural contexts, and these images are further complicated by engagements with them through the intersecting lens including ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, ability, queerness, and more.In the course, we will look at how socially marginalized groups, such as gay and lesbians, transgender persons, ethnic minorities, women in different stages of their lives, people with mental illness, teenagers, the elderlyand many others are portrayed, and seek to expand their on-screen existence in Hong Kong media. In the exploration, we will engage with key questions in critical film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, systems of media production, pro-sumer culture, (g)local cinema, alternative cinema, and new media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by “minority” filmmakers and media creators worldwide, and important cinematic and media movements that challenge the status-quo.

      "description": "(UGEC3224 is double-coded with GDRS3009.)  This course examines issues revolving the family as a social institution in different cultures. It explores processes of how the family is constructed in different forms as it intersects with various social systems including kinship, marriage, class, ethnicity, religion, and political economy. Particular attention is paid to how family as a gendered construction, while being a basic principle of social life globally, exhibits great diversity as it shapes and is shaped by local histories, traditions, and state policies. In an era of globalization and transnational mobility, the ideology and practice of the family are rapidly changing, but there are simultaneously trends of reversion and localization. Students will read ethnographies and develop cross-cultural perspectives on classic and contemporary issues concerning the family, such as work and domesticity, motherhoods and fatherhoods, sexual orientations, reproductive technologies, surrogacy and adoption. Students learn to critically think and articulate about family issues, and will acquire enhanced knowledge and skills in reflexive thinking and positive communication, cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion. The course is relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, in particular SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).",

      "course_syllabus": "1. The Family: An anthropological perspective (SDG #5, 10, 16)\n\nThe family is often imagined to be a social institution with a set of values and relationships shared by everyone in society. This is far from reality. In this lecture we look at the definitions of family across cultures, and look at how family interacts with different social systems such as religion, political system and modes of production, and investigate how family values may differ in different ethnic groups and how they change over time. Concepts of cultural relativism and holism will be introduced.\n\n2. Kinship and lineage (SDG #5, 10)\n\nKinship and lineage have played an important part in the political economy of society, in the past as well as in present time. In this lecture we discuss the commonalities as well as the differences across cultures, and look at the factors leading to continuity and/or change, such as urbanization, globalization, appearance of reproductive technologies, adoption, surrogacy, and changing values in sexuality.\n\n3. Role of marriage in family (SDG #5, 10, 16)\n\nThis lecture looks at how marriage may or may not be related to family formation, and the role of marriage in society. In addition, marriage regulations and practices are highly related to gender ideologies. These relations exist in diverse forms and have transformed over time, for example as governments promulgate new marriage laws and as civil society demands for reform.\n\n4. Domesticity and gender division of labor (SDG #5, 10, 16)\n\nHow was the idea “man are breadwinners; women are homemakers” formulated in history and how is it challenged in contemporary society? This lecture will discuss issues of domesticity and how gender division of labor at home is related to the gender division of labor in society. We will examine the roles of religion and science, as well as of the church and government in the production of gendered social arrangements. Students will learn to identify systemic barriers to gender equality.\n\n5. Violence against Women (SDG #5, 16)\n\nWhy are women the majority of victims of domestic violence across cultures? Why do many women choose to stay in abusive relations? In this lecture we look at the social and cultural factors that influence women’s decision to confront, escape, or endure domestic violence, and discuss how family and ideologies and practices have played a part in the perpetuation of VAW in different cultures. Students will investigate potential solutions for VAW as a form of gender inequality.\n\n6. Parenthood and socialization (SDG #5, 10)\n\nDo all parents love their children? Do parents in different cultures raise their children the same way? Why is raising children in families with same-sex parents, single parents, and migrant parents considered problematic? If socialization is the way to reproduce socially acceptable individuals, what form, content, and means should it take? This lecture seeks to dispel the misconception that parent-child relations are natural and uniform, by looking at the diverse forms of parenthood and ways of socialization in different cultures.\n\n7. Spousal relations: duties, affection, and intimacy (SDG #5, 10)\n\nHow is spousal relationship culturally constructed? What are the components of spouse-hood and how do they relate to politics, economics, religion and other social systems? Why do extra-marital affairs happen and how does society deal with it? This lecture looks at the ideology and practice of spouse-hood across different cultures, and asks what role it has in formulating the family as social institution.\n\n8. Globalization, affluence and livelihood (SDG #5, 10, 16)\n\nThis lecture looks at global transformation processes and how they affect the family both as a social institution and as a network of related individuals. We look at how consumerism, social media, and converging values seemingly sync-ing familial structures and emotions across the globe, but at the same time noting how families in different societies, as they undergo globalization and wealth polarization, are torn by desires of economic growth and downward social mobility.\n\n9. Transnational mobility and family (SDG #5, 10)\n\nIn an era of globalization, more and more people cross national borders for a better life, creating transnational families as family members live in different countries in the form of split households, or as individuals become members of family in a different culture. In this lecture we look at this growing phenomenon and discuss issues about acculturation, family relations and power dynamics, how affines and agnates create transnational communities, and what happens to those who are left behind in the hometown.\n\n10. New kinship and alternative family (SDG #5, 10)\n\nWe will discuss how arrangements such as same-sex marriage, cohabitation, and polygamous relations would challenge conventional understandings of kinship and family in society. We will reflect on these issues in relation to contemporary debates on heterosexual normativity, monogamy, and same-sex relations.\n\n11. Doing family in China (SDG #5, 16)\n\nThe concept of family has various levels of meanings in Chinese culture, and throughout Chinese history these have transformed in response to the needs and ideologies of the time. While Han families may share certain idealized views of the family as a social system, its practice is perhaps as varied as the number of families. Ethnic groups and Chinese overseas communities add to this complexity as their worldviews, religions, and socioeconomic environments acculturate thinking and behavior that differ from what is understood as Chinese core values.\n\n12. Doing family in Asia (SDG #5, 16)\n\nThis lecture will bring together ethnographic cases in Asia to illustrate the interaction of different social systems revolving around the family. By comparing changes and continuities of family formation and relations in the region using a cross-cultural perspective, we are able to reflect on our own culture, and understand the pros and cons of the ideologies and practices that we are socialized in.\n\n13. Family, power, and intersectionality (SDG #5, 10, 16)\n\nThis lecture discusses individuals’ multi-layered identities and how these intersect with family membership. We will examine roles, statuses and power generated from positions in the family, gender and ethnicity, at work and school, on the media and more. The multiple locales in which individuals perform their everyday experiences are examined holistically, which helps us rethink how seemingly “natural” behavior are really cultural constructs, and how taken-for-granted ideas of family membership shape our everyday lives, our life goals as individuals, and the regulations and resources that constitute society.",

      "description": "(UGEC3225 is double-coded with GDRS3024.)  Educational and occupational accomplishments vary dramatically among individuals and profoundly affect lives. Importantly, gender is among the powerful individual characteristics that affect people's experiences in educational and work settings. Gender shapes youths' experience and outcomes of education across the globe and across history. This course is designed to introduce to students, with a critical mindset, important contemporary issues at the intersection of gender, education and jobs. The topics address the role of gender in school- and related preferences and achievements, with a focus on social and cognitive approaches. For example, what is quality education (SDG goal 4) and why is it important to evaluate it with a gender perspective? Do men and women really differ in their abilities, and if so, by how much? Is personal interest a better explanation of gender imbalances in occupations? What are the ways that biases exist in education and the workplace, and how do teachers, parents, and employers contribute to gender biases (SDG goal 5)? Can gender equality in performance and hiring be improved by removing stereotypes? The literature will cover childhood, adolescence as well as adulthood in order to provide insight into the age-related changes of the gender issues. Particular attention will be paid to issues that relate closely to daily life, both local and international. Empirical evidence will be reviewed to illustrate the gender biases and substantiate the explanatory theories. Potential interventions to address gender biases in education and the workplace will also be discussed.",

      "course_syllabus": "This course is designed to introduce to students, with a critical mindset, important contemporary issues at the\n\nintersection of gender and education and achievement. Collectively, the topics address the gender-education nexus in academic, occupational, and social domains from childhood through adulthood. We will pay particular attention to issues that relate closely to daily life, both local and international. Theories and data will be drawn mainly from Psychology but will also come from other disciplines.\n\nIn terms of SDGs, the course is most relevant for goal #4 (Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education) and goal #5 (Achieve gender equality and empower the marginalised gender).\n\nMajor concepts and topics:\n\n1. Quality education and equitable workplace\n\nOpen discussion and review impressions on education and occupational contexts locally and internationally to assess if our current education is inclusive and equitable, and if gender equality and marginalization of gender are still pertinent questions in our society. Why is it important to achieve gender equality and empower the marginalized gender?\n\n2. Gender differences and similarities in educational and occupational achievement\n\nThis topic includes questions such as: Gender differences is a topic that has fascinated researchers and is a topic of daily conversation. Do men/boys really differ from women/girls, and how? How big are the differences? Does it depend on contexts?\n\n3. Gender-related academic and occupational interests and goals\n\nSome argue that the gender gaps in academic and occupational outcomes may not be entirely the result of differences in ability or prejudice, but differences in the interests and goals of men/boys and women/girls. Are there gender differences in what people prefer as study subjects and occupations? What do men and women look for in their jobs?\n\n4. Gender socialization in schools\n\nIn modern society, we spend almost ¼ of our life attending school. While a lot of gender socialization occurs at home, the school is also an important ground for gender socialization. What messages do schools and teachers send to students? How does sexism occur at schools and what interventions have been tested?\n\n5. Gender segregation at schools: The case of single-sex education\n\nSingle-sex schools exist in many countries over the globe. However, few may notice that such institutional segregation of gender in the context of education has been a matter of intense social and scientific debate in the West. What are the rationales for the setting up of single-sex education? Do they live up to the tests of scientific studies? What are the possible consequences of gender segregation at schools?\n\n6. Motivation, stereotypes and engagement: Does gender matter?\n\nOn the personal level, various psychological mechanisms may be at work to produce gender differences in educational and occupational achievement. What are some of these mechanisms? For example, how does stereotype threat and self efficacy theories apply to create gendered phenomena to make education inequitable?\n\n7. Gender biases in the workplace\n\nWomen’s status in the workplace has improved drastically over the decades. However, have we gotten rid of gender biases in the workplace? What are some of the ways that gender biases manifest in today’s workplace, personally or institutionally, explicitly or implicitly?\n\n8. Interventions to address gender gaps in the workplace\n\nIf gender gaps still exist in the workplace, what can be done about it? For example, what interventions may be effective in narrowing the gender gap in STEM participation? Many companies have adopted a quota policy to increase their representation of women. What have research shown about the impact of having more women or just more diversity in groups?\n\nThe teaching and learning approach will be a mix of teacher-guided and student-centred activities. Lectures will introduce the background knowledge of each topic and review the required readings. Then, students will be engaged in active group discussions. Before class, students have to post intellectual questions concerning the assigned readings. They will also look for additional discussion materials (academic articles, news reports, blog posts, etc.) and share them in class during discussions and presentations. The teacher and tutor(s) will monitor and guide the discussions. Towards the end of the course, students will present a poster on a self-selected topic related to gender and education/achievement in a mini-conference, and write an essay on the same topic to conclude their learned knowledge and demonstrate their ability to critically analyse the topic.",

It traces how LGBTQI+ communities develop against the backdrops of social forces and social oppression. It analyzes the cultural, social and legal environments that LGBTQI+ people live with, in diverse spheres such as families, education, employment, health and the media. The discussions focus on both the structural constraints that LGBTQI+ people face, but also the agency and resilience they display. It explores the development of contemporary LGBTQI+ identities and social movements, as well as the politics involved. The course also asks how gender and sexual diversity is understood in different parts of the world in an era of globalization. Students are also exposed to different practices, policies and laws that are related to LGBTQI+ people’s lives.The Sustainable Development Goals vow to work towards a society where no one if left behind, particularly those who are most vulnerable and marginalized. In many parts of the world, LGBTQI+ people are historically amongst the most vulnerable and marginalized in society. This course will discuss the unequal treatment they face in cultural, social, political and legal systems and discuss how such inequality may be addressed.",

This course examines the social construction of minorities and the history of Hong Kong public policy towards them, including legal changes, social institutions, immigration policy, and political mobilization. Current debates in public policies such as anti-discrimination legislation, education policies of ethnic minorities, disciplining of youth and anti-poverty scheme will also be evaluated within this context. We will draw on an array of intellectual resources ranging from political economy, critical race theory, feminism, phenomenology and queer theory to examine issues about racial/ethnic minorities, the economically underprivileged, minorities with disabilities, sexual/erotic minorities, gender minorities and youth in light of the latest scholarly discussions on multiculturalism, pluralism and the politics of difference and social recognition.The course is relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) with a focus on how public policy plays an important role in obstructing and facilitating the attainment of these goals.",

      "description": "(UGEC3229 is double-coded with GDRS3007.)  This course examines men’s diverse experiences as boys/men and public discourses and practices about masculinities. It will focus on how the gendered social order influences men’s actions and the way men perceive themselves, other men, women, and social situations. It will pay special attention to the exploration of the relationships between multiple dimensions of social relations and inequalities including gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation. It will address issues such as: male socialization, boyhood culture, male body images, male friendship, male sexuality and fertility, men’s experiences as fathers, male aggression and violence, men’s commitments to sports and work, and media representations of boys and men in contemporary culture. It will also explore female masculinities and queer masculinities and to what extent they post challenges to hegemonic masculinity. Students will be introduced to the latest developments and their global networks, and to evaluate the prospects for social change in how men may think, feel, and act otherwise.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) through critical engagement with different discourses and phenomenon related to masculinities.",

      "description": "(UGEC3481 is double-coded with CURE3003.)  How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William’s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals’ life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park – Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla – Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo – Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.",

This course is a survey of Southeast Asian cinema read against the backdrop of its distinct historical, political, ecological, and cultural conditions. Initially a Cold War construct comprising Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, and Timor-Leste, the term ‘Southeast Asia’ has come to refer to a highly complex and pluralistic region of over 660 million people, 25,000 islands, and 150 ethnolinguistic communities. With its national identities formed from the encounter with and struggle against American, British, French, Dutch, Hispanic, Indian, Japanese, and Chinese influence, Southeast Asia’s movies have served as venues for propaganda and resistance. This course looks at how the remediations of different genres such as noir, melodrama, western, and sci-fi tackle controversial issues of gender, race, religion, poverty, migration, and the environment. Instead of smoothening the continuity of official historical narratives, it uncovers how documentaries, epics, and horror reexamine the trauma of past colonization, authoritarianism, and violence. To conclude, the course explores how television serials, anthology films, and online databases trace nascent cross-border and intra-regional communities beyond the limits of sovereignty.",

In particular, we will examine the meaning of media and culture and its social changes in contemporary Korea through exploring various emerging trends and cultural studies as methodological tool within modern and contemporary Korean issues. Global popularity of Korean popular culture and the transnational Hallyu (Korean Wave) boom continue to percolate beyond Asia and inspire various critical questions regarding trans-nationalism, cultural imperialism and musical authenticity and hybridity. The course readings engage wide range of various issues and arguments of media and cultural studies scholarship as methodological tools; such as cultural representation, meaning of hegemony, cultural industry/economy and globalism of media, post colonialism, audience of mass media and fandom culture, gender and queer issues, and then further focus on the specific context of Korean popular culture including the pivotal notions of colonial modernity, Japanese imperialism, cultural hegemony in colonial Korea, meaning of Americanization, issues of popular memory and decolonization discourses, nationalism and globalization and Korean Wave, body/gender/sexuality / LGBTQ issue in Korean Media and Popular culture, cyber culture and internet memes, transnationalism and diaspora issues and its aftermath. We actively discuss various audio-visual artifacts including Korean news, music video, films, TV dramas, and pop music in each class in order to understand better the texts and contexts within the historical and sociocultural paradigm of recent sociology, media/communication studies scholarship.",

Using key concepts and theories in mass communication and cultural studies, it discusses the influences and power of mass media with an emphasis on gender-related issues. The latter are in turn related to other social and cultural phenomena that will bring in knowledge and perspectives from other disciplines (e.g. sociology and psychology). The course will examine several recurring controversies related to gender in mass media. These controversies range from representation of sex and gender in media, to the media portrayals of homosexuals and the treatment of taboos. The course will identify and discuss the many competing viewpoints, and the ensuing actions, held by different stakeholders, including media producers, social activists, government regulators, educators and the general audiences. Their implications to legislation and education will also be identified.Students will be able to describe the key characteristics of modern media, in particular their roles in the construction of gender identities and discourses about various gender issues.",

      "course_syllabus": "The course will cover six recurring gender issues. These issues are intentionally framed as debatable controversies. At first glance, these controversies might stand as individual case studies that have little logical coherence. However, they all address key concepts in mass communication and gender theories. The class will study the roles of media in the production and propagation of these heated debates. The class will also study the competing viewpoints, and their justifications, held by different stakeholders. The sequence of these issues implies a progression of knowledge regarding both topics.\n\nThe following is an outline of the course:\n\n* *Week 1 Introduction: The Personal is Political**\n\nThe course will begin with an overview of a feminist statement \"The Personal is Political\". By introducing a special chapter in the feminist movement in the late 1960s, the first lecture invites students to reflect on the agenda of feminists, and connect it to the roles of mass media and individual members in our society. It will also discuss the concept of 'gender' and introduce the six upcoming debates.\n\n* Key concepts: Power of mass media, gender and society, feminism*\n\n* *Week 2 Stereotypes in media: Are stereotypes inherently bad?**\n\nThe meanings of stereotypes and archetypes are defined. The class will trace the birth, development and death of certain stereotypes in media, and from there reflects on the power of mass media.\n\n* Key concepts: Stereotypes, social roles, social typing, media construction of reality*\n\n* *Week 3 and 4 Masculinity and femininity – Can men and women ever be equal?**\n\nThe class discusses the binary oppositions between masculinity and femininity. Social roles, social learning theory and socialization are the relevant key concepts. How discourses about both sexes are formed and acquired will also be discussed. Advertising on slimming (or other gender-related products) and magazines targeting men and women readers will be used for case studies.\n\n* Key concepts: Definitions of masculinity and femininity, socialization, psychoanalysis, media discourses*\n\n* *Week 5 and 6 Sex in the media: Should we ban pornography?**\n\nUsing film excerpts, masterpieces in art history and other examples, students will learn to differentiate between pornography and erotica. The class will discuss the characteristics of pornography as a distinctive type of media genre, which sensitizes the class to the features of mass media. Students will debate for or against legislation against pornography.\n\n* Key concepts: Definitions of pornography, erotica; media genres; legislation against pornography*\n\n* *Week 7 and 8 True love in media: Are stories about true love in media beneficial or harmful to the impressionable minds?**\n\nThe class teaches 'narratives' and examines the structures of popular love stories in films and television. It aims to reveal how media exerts power through reinforcing certain versions of stories and hence ideology.\n\n* Key concepts: Love and relationships in media, media narratives, media ideology*\n\n* *Week 9 and 10 Sexualities in media: Should gays and lesbians be positively represented in media?**\n\nThe class examines the wide spectrum of 'sexualities' in reality, and their portrayals in media. Particular attention will be given to the depiction of homosexuals. The class will learn about the 'semiotic war' waged by social activists in presenting homosexuals in the public. Both the marketing hype and the social movement around homosexuals will be discussed and debated in class.\n\n* Key concepts: Definitions of sexualities, homosexuals, gay rights movement, media construction of homosexuals, hegemonic role of media*\n\n* *Week 11 and 12 Taboos and scandals in media: Are media challenging or reinforcing taboos about sex?**\n\nThe class redefines 'taboos' with references to the roles of mass media. Students will examine how mass media make use of taboos in both fictional and news media. Students will debate whether taboos are challenged or reinforced in today mass media. Students will also study how media use scandals to reaffirm certain moral values in a society.\n\n* Key concepts: Definitions of taboos and scandals, moral panic, media norms*\n\n* *Week 13 Forum: Policy makers, educators, social activists, media producers**\n\nA concluding debate that centers on a current issue",

Key concepts will be introduced so that students can apply them in formulating their own analyses. The class will also study the competing viewpoints, and their justifications, held by different stakeholders. The sequence of these issues implies a progression of knowledge regarding the ten questions to be asked and answered in the course.\n\nThe following is an outline of the course:\n\n(1) Introduction: The formation of Hong Kong Culture, a historical overview\nThe lecture will trace the formation and changes of Hong Kong culture from the 1950s to the 2010s, relating social changes to the cultural changes of audio-visual texts produced in different periods of time. Key concepts will be introduced to help students make sense of cultural patterns as articulated in movies and television programs.\nKey concepts: textuality, contextuality, media representations\n\n(2) The Birth of Hong Kong Man\nThe lecture will focus on the cultural differentiations of mainlanders and Hongkongers in the 1970s. Students will think about the question of why Hong Kong people, mostly ethnic Chinese, saw themselves as a rather different social group of their own. A few classic texts will be used to illustrate the logic of \"othering\" and stigmatizing mainlanders.\nKey concepts: \"other\", cultural imaginations, stigma\n\n(3) New Wave Film and Colonial Politics\nThe lecture will introduce some basic concepts of colonialism. Some mainstream texts will be contrasted with some new wave movies of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some patterns of colonial articulations and de-articulations will be illustrated by these mainstream and new wave productions.\nKey concepts: colonialism, marginality\n\n(4) Political Metaphors in TV and Film\nThe lecture will explain the reasons why there were quite of lot of political metaphors in television and films produced in the 1990s. The relations between political censorship, social anxiety and polysemic articulations will be elaborated with significant cases.\nKey concepts: polysemy, metaphor, censorship\n\n(5) Nonsense and Nostalgia, Remembering and Forgetting\nThe lecture will explain the nature of mediated collective memories and the social functions they perform. The rise of nostalgic texts in the 1990s will be contrasted with the discourses of collective memories in the 2000s.\nKey concepts: nostalgia, collective memories\n\n(6) Urban Space & Postmodern City\nThe lecture will trace the changes in urban representations in films and television from the 1980s up to recent years when discourses concerning urban developments and cultural preservations are competing for public attention.\nKey concepts: urban imaginations, postmodernity, space and place\n\n(7) Media Events: 1997 and 1st July\nThe lecture will introduce the theory of \"media events\" and apply it to major turning points of Hong Kong society such as July 1st in 1997 and 2003, SARS, the Sichuan earthquake, etc. The changes of Hong Kong culture will be examined by looking into the configurations of major media events in recent years.\nKey concepts: media events, social movements\n\n(8) The Rise & Fall of the HK Middle Class\nThe lecture will trace the \"middle class debate\" in the 1980s. Students will be asked to think about their own class positions and how they acquired a class-relevant lifestyle. The changes in media representations of the middle class will be analyzed to see how these representations have become more sophisticated since the 1990s.\nKey concepts: middle class, cultural capitals, taste\n\n(9) Post 97 Hong Kong Culture\nThe lecture will summarize some major changes in Hong Kong cultures after 1997 and contrast these new patterns with the cultural scene before 1997, focusing on the negotiations of local and national identifications.\nKey concepts: re-sinicization, nationalism\n\n(10) Transborder and Transnational Desire\nThe lecture will tell the story of the Hong Kong/Mainland border and the cultural politics it brings to the people on both sides of the border. As cultural differentials have been lowered in recent years, the general categorizations of them and us are replaced by much more complicated transborder collaborations infused with excitements and apprehensions.\nKey concepts: transborder cultural politcs, border, cultural boundaries\n\n(11) Undercover Films: the double identity of Hong Kong\nUsing films featuring under-covered agents, the lecture will talk about the multiple identity of Hong Kong, relating this issue to Hong Kong colonial history and the political structure of one country and two systems.\nKey concepts: collaborative colonialism, instrumental rationality\n\n(12) Orientalism: Hong Kong, Hollywood and Beyond\nThe lecture will use Hong Kong movie star Chow Yuen-fat as a case to examine the rise and changes of Hong Kong culture. The \"star-text\" of Chow will be used to illustrate the effects of Orientalism, comparing Chow's local films and those produced in Hollywood.\nKey concepts: orientalism, star text\n\n(13) The decline of local films and the rise of co-productions\nThe lecture will document the trends of co-productions and examine the effects on the weakening of local representations and the amplifications of national imaginations.\nKey concepts: de-scaling, re-scaling, local scale, national scale",

Characteristics of primary language impairment, aphasia, dysarthria, and hearing impairments, as well as articulation, fluency, and voice and other related disorders affecting language are among the topics to be discussed. Diagnostic techniques and treatment strategies are also introduced.Discussions will be made on the impacts of language impairment on one’s cognitive development, academic performance, as well as physical, psychological and social well-being across the lifespan (SDG#3 Good Health and Well-Being). Students will be able to gain a better understanding of how people suffering from these disorders are deprived from healthy lives (SDG#3 Good Health and Well-Being), quality education (SDG#4 Quality Education), employment opportunities (SDG#8 Decent Work and Economic Growth), and social equality (SDG#10 Reduced Inequalities). Students will also come to appreciate the benefits brought by the relevant assessment and treatment in promoting personal wellbeing (SDG#3 Good Health and Well-Being), ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education (SDG#4 Quality Education), providing full and productive employment and decent work for all (SDG#8 Decent Work and Economic Growth), as well as reducing inequality in the society (SDG#10 Reduced Inequalities).",
