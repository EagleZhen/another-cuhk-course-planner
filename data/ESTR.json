Students will work in small groups on a practical project in which they will apply the design methodology introduced to them in lectures in a design project. The project work will involve defining milestones, identifying the constraints and requirements, defining the requirement specifications of the design, making and evaluating different possible designs by carrying out experiments to obtain data for refining the design, prototyping of the final design and testing of the system built in the project.",

Students are invited to provide written feedback on \"the best aspects of the course so far\", \"aspects most in need of improvement\", \"How might the instructor improve his/her teaching\", a few other questions. These feedback are valuable to the course instructors and teaching assistants, who may accordingly make adjustment on the teaching methods as well as course content.\n\n2. End-of-term course evaluation\nThe end-of-term course evaluation is a formal and comprehensive evaluation process through students provide not only numerical ratings but also constructive suggestions on the course and teachers. The survey covers the aspects of students' overall satisfaction, course organization and objectives, pace of teaching, workload, etc.Statistical analysis of numerical ratings and written feedback are sent to the course instructor shortly after the end of term.\n\n3. Face-to-face interaction\nStudents' feedback are collected through face-to-face interaction, which may take place in tutorial classes, laboratory sessions, individual consultation (with course instructor and/or teaching assistants).\n\n4. Online platform\nStudents' feedback are collected via various types of online platforms, which include (and not limited to) email, Blackboard, Piazza.\n\n5.

The problems of electrons in a 1-D potential well and electron scattering in potential barriers are addressed. Fundamental concept and theories of semiconductor devices are introduced: hydrogen atoms, bonds, crystal structures, band theory of solids, effective mass, and the Fermi energy. Electric conductions in semiconductors are taught: intrinsic and extrinsic, drift, mobility, diffusion, recombination, Hall effect. Properties and structures of metal-semiconductor junction, p-n junction and MOS capacitor are analyzed, and their breakdown effects are described. Semiconductor transistors, including MOSFET and JFET, are briefly introduced. Integrated circuits fabrication is also described: layer formation, photolithography and layout.",

Students are invited to provide written feedback on \"the best aspects of the course so far\", \"aspects most in need of improvement\", \"How might the instructor improve his/her teaching\", a few other questions. These feedback are valuable to the course instructors and teaching assistants, who may accordingly make adjustment on the teaching methods as well as course content.\n\n2. End-of-term course evaluation\nThe end-of-term course evaluation is a formal and comprehensive evaluation process through students provide not only numerical ratings but also constructive suggestions on the course and teachers. The survey covers the aspects of students' overall satisfaction, course organization and objectives, pace of teaching, workload, etc.\nStatistical analysis of numerical ratings and written feedback are sent to the course instructor shortly after the end of term.\n\n3. Face-to-face interaction\nStudents' feedback are collected through face-to-face interaction, which may take place in tutorial classes, laboratory sessions, individual consultation (with course instructor and/or teaching assistants).\n\n4. Online platform\nStudents' feedback are collected via various types of online platforms, which include (and not limited to) email, Blackboard, Piazza.\n\n5.

We start with the fundamentals of robotics and artificial intelligence. The technical topics include electronic and mechanical components of robots, sensors and robotic vision, sensor data fusion and evaluation, signal and image processing. The knowledge areas cover robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, robot motion and task planning, robotic programming, and human-robot interaction. It aims to help students establish a wide-spectrum understanding about the principles and the fundamental knowledge of robotics, perception and intelligence in a real-world context.",

It is carried out by the course instructor(s) in the middle of the term (i.e., the 6th/7th week). Students are invited to provide written feedback on \"the best aspects of the course so far\", \"aspects most in need of improvement\", \"How might the instructor improve his/her teaching\", a few other questions. These feedback are valuable to the course instructors and teaching assistants, who may accordingly make adjustment on the teaching methods as well as course content.\n\n2. End-of-term course evaluation\nThe end-of-term course evaluation is a formal and comprehensive evaluation process through students provide not only numerical ratings but also constructive suggestions on the course and teachers. The survey covers the aspects of students' overall satisfaction, course organization and objectives, pace of teaching, workload, etc.\nStatistical analysis of numerical ratings and written feedback are sent to the course instructor shortly after the end of term.\n\n3. Face-to-face interaction\nStudents' feedback are collected through face-to-face interaction, which may take place in tutorial classes, laboratory sessions, individual consultation (with course instructor and/or teaching assistants).\n\n4. Online platform\nStudents' feedback are collected via various types of online platforms, which include (and not limited to) email, Blackboard, Piazza.\n\n5.

      "course_syllabus": "This course starts with the topic of Markov chain. It includes the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations, random walk, classification of states, limiting probabilities, and time reversibility. The second topic in the course is stopping time and martingales. This includes Wald's equation, the concept of martingale, and the martingale stopping theorem. The third topic is exponential distribution, Poisson distribution, and Poisson process. This includes the unique memoryless property of the exponential distribution, combining and splitting a Poisson random variable, method of randomization, various equivalent definitions for a Poisson process, and M/M/1 queue. Throughout the course, many examples of applications are related to communications and computers. The course syllabus may be updated from year to year.",

The course includes a creative project component for students to apply robot manipulators for a new and innovative application. This requires the students to design a new application for robot manipulators that would be useful to the community and globally. By using the introduction to the state-of-the-art in robotics around the world, and fundamentals learnt in the course, the students have to innovatively design and present the idea as a mock start-up company project.",

We start the course by introducing the problem-solving paradigm with deep learning: data preparation, building the model, training the model, model evaluation, and hyper-parameter searching. Then, we fill in the details in the paradigm. Regarding the deep learning\nmodels, we will go from the simplest linear regression model, towards the relatively complicated models. To handle various data types, that is, the structured data, images, text, sequences, signals, and graphs, in our daily life, we would cover CNN/ResNet, RNN/LSTM, Attention, and GNN models. In addition to the above paradigms, we will also cover the commonly used techniques to handle overfitting.
