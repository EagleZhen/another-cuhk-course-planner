      "description": "The course title states the two related goals of this course, designed to help freshers develop a positive attitude towards college life. Through a careful sequenced selection of outdoor team activities, workshops, service and work projects, students are challenged to examine their orientation in life as they become college members in university. Success of the course hinges on balancing two axes of concern, namely, (1) between teamwork and personal development and (2) between inward reflection and outward expression.This course is the major common learning experience of college students across all disciplines and years, initiating a fresher's identity as a member of S.H. Ho College. The activity-based approach facilitates the cohort of freshers to bond together as well as to integrate with the college community. As such, this induction course is a cornerstone of our College General Education (\"CGE\") Programme.Mission: To induce communal learning in college lifeVision: College as a community of learners in dialogue",

Applying the fundamental skillset and mindset equipped in GESH2011, students would implement their service-learning project in local communities. Through a series of self-initiated service, self-reflection, and project presentations, students would consolidate their insights and experience from community service and be directed to examine the meaning and value of university education in real life. This experiential learning approach would facilitate students’ self-development and foster their civic-mindedness in creating changes in the community.",

The goal is to broaden the concept of work beyond vocation, by developing a deep understanding of the nature of work and its broad array of possibilities. Throughout the course, students would be directed to appreciate the many realms of life experiences over and beyond work towards the focal concept of a productive life. As students are approaching the end of their university life, this course would be an opportune framework for examining the meaning and value of university education in real life.",
