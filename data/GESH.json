Through a careful sequenced selection of outdoor team activities, workshops, service and work projects, students are challenged to examine their orientation in life as they become college members in university. Success of the course hinges on balancing two axes of concern, namely, (1) between teamwork and personal development and (2) between inward reflection and outward expression.\n\nThis course is the major common learning experience of college students across all disciplines and years, initiating a fresher's identity as a member of S.H. Ho College. The activity-based approach facilitates the cohort of freshers to bond together as well as to integrate with the college community. As such, this induction course is a cornerstone of our College General Education (\"CGE\") Programme.\n\nMission: To induce communal learning in college life\nVision: College as a community of learners in dialogue",

In the Adventure stage, students build teams that strive to explore and understand themselves and their new environment. In the Reflection stage, students attend classes to examine aspects of personal development, in relation to college and university communities, individual and society. In the final Expression stage, students initiate productions in some suitable form, such as writing, documentary, performance, as a personal or team response.",

These are the suggested fields: 1. Environmental sustainability 2. Health and well-being 3. Quality education 4. Poverty and inequalities Students will act according to their proposal to address community needs. They need to map out a detailed and practical proposal for their actions to take in collaboration with their community partners. They are encouraged to document the process of their service. The below elements need to be included: * Application of multi-disciplinary skills and knowledge and concepts of civic engagement * Direct interaction with service recipients, community members, community partners, or local organisations/ representatives Through the experiential learning approach, this module aims to reinforce or examine students’ skills and knowledge in the classroom. |\n| Reflection | The Reflection component comprises two dimensions to maximise their learning: * Service-Learning Reflection * Self-reflection After completing the community service, each group are encouraged to discuss the following core questions in their poster presentation: 1. What was the significance of your service? 2. What did you learn during your service that reinforces/ contradicts your learning gained in the classroom? 3. What are the difficulties encountered when addressing those SDGs in the local context? 4. What is the relationship of your Service-Learning Project (SLP) to the “real world”? While each student is expected to write a portfolio, projecting their personal growth in terms of the meaning of knowledge and life. They could discuss three core questions: 1. What insights did you gain through your project that might assist you in your career or in selecting a career? 2. What impact might your project have on your life-long learning process? 3. What did you learn about community involvement, citizenship and civic responsibility? |\n| Demonstration | In this module, students will demonstrate what they have learned throughout the process of service-learning through a more formal presentation, including a review of their proposal, community service, new findings, suggestions and reflections. This module aims to consolidate their leanings and extend the impact of their project to others through sharing their experiences. |",
