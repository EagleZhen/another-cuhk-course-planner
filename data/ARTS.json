      "terms": [],
      "description": "The course is designed as a sequel to ARTS1000 (Classics of Chinese Humanities: Selected Readings) by focusing on a number of representative texts by famous Chinese intellectuals and writers. They bear witness to the mental deliberations of a generation—or two generations—caught between the forces of tradition and modernity as they found their way through the thicket of source materials from both Chinese and Western cultural traditions. Each author chooses to confront the legacies of Chinese tradition—literary, cultural, and intellectual—by subjecting them to a new reevaluation from modern perspectives derived from their newly acquired knowledge and/or experience from the West. Their modes of analysis have set a new intellectual and scholarly benchmark for later generations. In short, these texts have become modern “classics” in their own right.",

      "course_syllabus": "Several famous authors from different fields of intellectual endeavor are selected –all from the Republican period. Each is represented by a basic text (BT) that is widely influential, hence designed for required reading. These texts in turn are related and can be compared to other texts produced around the same time (listed as supplementary texts or ST) for recommended reading. Altogether they provide a crucial cultural background against which we can then measure our situation in the present 21st century.\n\n科目將選取數位來自各個不同的知識領域的著名作者，全都是民國時期的知識份子和作家。我們會從每位作者的作品中選取一篇具廣泛影響力的代表作，以此作為學員必讀的基礎文本（BT）。學員將閱讀一系列差不多同時期出版的補充文本（ST），這些文本既與基礎文本相互關連，又可相互對照。總而言之，這些文本共同提供了一個重要的文化背景，我們可以借此衡量自身當下所處的二十一世紀的境況。\n\nFormat: The course is designed as public lectures, in which Professor Leo Lee will give detailed interpretations of the texts (both basic and supplementary) and place them in a framework of cultural history. Professor Cheung Lik Kwan will assist him by giving two lectures and conducting additional discussions when necessary. The contents of this new course are not limited to literary texts but rather cover a broader intellectual ground, since we will also attempt to delve into the cultural and social context in which such texts were produced--the reason being that modern Chinese literature has become an integral part of modern Chinese history. As such it provides a natural platform for an interdisciplinary attempt to connect literature to cultural and intellectual history, which has been Professor Lee’s own training and background anyway.\n\n授課形式：我們將本科目設計成公開演講的模式，李歐梵教授會在演講中仔細解釋各個文本（包括基礎文本和補充文本），並將之置於文化史的架構中作深入的探討。張歷君教授會在課堂上協助李教授，在必要時進行延伸討論，並發表兩次演講。這個新科目的內容不限於文學文本，而範圍更廣闊，我們會嘗試探討文本產生的文化和社會背景脈絡，因為中國現代文學已然成為中國現代史不可分割的部份。這種做法也提供了一個把文學和文化及思想史連系起來的跨學科研究嘗試的合適平臺。李教授自身的學術訓練和背景本來就是如此。",

      "description": "Creative economy and cultural industries have been considered crucial strategies for driving the urban development of global cities. The dynamic landscape of the global cultural scene, where culture converges with the economy, community, heritage, and innovative technologies, has created an impetus for many cities to adopt innovative approaches in utilising urban spaces and cultural resources, enabling citizens to vividly reimagine their urban and cultural life. These approaches are envisioned as and manifested in the form of the development of large-scale urban regions and city clusters, where major cultural facilities such as museums, art districts, performance venues, and festivals significantly contribute to social well-being and intercultural dialogue.\nThis course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to explore the interface between culture, urban space, and the economy with an eye towards the radically changing cultural landscape of Hong Kong. By offering students both theoretical knowledge and firsthand field experience, this course examines museums, galleries, and various cultural institutions as exemplary cases of how different forms of cultural activities can be turned into powerhouses of creative synergies and economic growth. By the end of the course, students will have gained insight into the complex relationships between the emerging phenomenon of creative cities and urban cultural life, as well as heritage and Chinese culture.",

      "description": "The state of humanities in academia the world over is in crisis. Part of the crisis is caused by global trends toward financial and technological capitalism, but the other part of the problem has to be sought in the humanistic disciplines themselves. Over-specialization in research, fragmentation among and within disciplines, the pressure of utilitarian goals (such as grant-getting for faculty promotion and practical job-orientation for students) are but some of the manifestations obvious to all. How to remedy the situation? Short of an institutional overhaul, we might begin from our own academic base, humanities departments under the Faculty of Arts.\n\nFrom an academic point of view, over-specialization in the humanities departments results in scholars working in narrow and isolated fields without interaction with colleagues in other departments and fields. The study of China also suffers from such an academic trend, which results in fragmentary studies of narrowly defined topics that fail to connect with each other and with the larger background. A further problem, particularly evident in some humanities fields, is the over-reliance on Western theory, which is applied to Chinese data without reflection or mediation. Certain theoretical excesses, as exemplified in the work of Michel Foucault and other poststructuralist theorists, have led to a general distrust of the human subject itself. Indeed, even the word “humanities” has lost its meaning.\n\nThis seminar is designed to explore new ways of making “connections” or “reconnections” across various disciplines and theoretical domains, it is broadly-based by design and all-inclusive in content. It is also intended to serve as a general forum for faculty-student discussion so as to provide a stimulus for humanistic scholarship and future research.",

The array of topics will expose them to the need to cross narrow disciplinary boundaries. At the very least, they will have a sense of the underlying methodologies and assumptions of different disciplines in the humanities. This will in turn stimulate their own interest in interdisciplinary studies and help them identify topics for their own MPhil and Ph. D research.",

The topics stem from a background in literature, history, and cultural studies, with side forays into anthropology, music, film and architecture.\n1 Introduction: Crossing boundaries and making connections\n2 Mediating connections: theory, criticism, comparison\n3 “Unexpected affinities”: Sima Qian’s (司馬遷) Xiangyu (項羽) vs. Homer’s Achilles as heroic tropes\n4 Cultural Filiations: Vico and Zhu Gungqian (朱光潛)\n5 Literary modernity: The lyrical and the Epic in China and Europe\n6 Changing imaginaries of space: China and the World\n7 Lu Xun (魯迅) and “Specters” (with a glance at Walter Benjamin)\n\nThe second part of the course will be guest presentations organized into four thematic groups :\n1. history, religion and anthropology\n2. language, philosophy and translation\n3. music and visual culture\n4. leftwing cosmopolitanism in the 1930s.\n\nThe final part of the seminar will consist of reports by registered postgraduate students, preferably Ph.D. and MPhil candidates, on a topic related to their proposed research that can benefit from such an inter-disciplinary forum.",

      "description": "The use of digital methods in research is growing rapidly in many fields in the humanities from China Studies to archaeology. This course introduces students to the exciting world of digital humanities, including text mining (text), digital analysis of images (image), and 3-D scanning and printing (object). These are skills that can be used to gain insights from texts written in Chinese, English and other languages, paintings, engravings or statuary, as well as historical artefacts. Students will be able to apply what they learn in this course to a range of questions in the humanities. It will also be useful in a variety of future careers in both the academic and applied humanities. This is an introductory postgraduate course and no background in digital humanities is required. The class will meet in the Digital Scholarship Lab of the University Library and will culminate in a group project (website) that students can add to their portfolios.",
