      "description": "The course covers introduction to robots in different industries, microcontroller unit, programming using Arduino, sensors, actuators, mechanisms and engineering design principles. It provides the students extensive hands-on training on robot prototype development and experimental evaluation. It adopts a project-based learning approach: the students are required to design and build a fully functional robotic system that must be able to perform a specific task. Both mechanical and electronic hardware will be designed and developed by the students. The lectures and laboratory sessions are designed so as to equip them with the essential knowledge to successfully complete their project.",

This is a project-based experiential course that exposes students to design and build practical robots. Students will be required to conceptualize and perform high-level design of a robot system, and then design and build various components using skills including CAD drawing, mechanical structure, electronic circuits and programming skills. Students will practice their engineering knowledge through tutorial-style workshops and laboratory sessions. The goal is to develop and nurture skills in problem-solving, hands-on skills, project and time management through the project. Students should obtain approval from the course instructor to ensure that the participated activities are in-line with the course learning outcomes.",

The course includes a creative project component for students to apply robot manipulators for a new and innovative application. This requires the students to design a new application for robot manipulators that would be useful to the community and globally. By using the introduction to the state-of-the-art in robotics around the world, and fundamentals learnt in the course, the students have to innovatively design and present the idea as a mock start-up company project.",

      "description": "Combustion and its control are essential to our daily life and more than 80% of the energy used nowadays is from combustion sources. This course starts with the basic principles that govern combustion phenomena such as conservation of mass, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and the momentum principle. Then students will learn the new applications of these basic principles to account for the chemical transformations. We will discuss the basic concepts of chemical kinetics and the forms of reaction rate laws that apply in combustion processes, as well as mass transport phenomena. These laws will be applied to a variety of combustion phenomena, including spontaneous ignition of combustible mixtures, pollutant formation, internal combustion engine and fire safety.",

      "description": "This course provides a theoretical and practical guidance on how to design parts to gain the maximum benefit from what additive manufacturing (AM) can offer. It begins by describing the main AM technologies and their respective advantages and disadvantages. It then examines strategic considerations in the context of designing for additive manufacturing (DfAM), such as designing to avoid anisotropy, designing to minimize print time, and post-processing, before discussing the economics of AM. The course then focuses on computational tools for design analysis and the optimization of AM parts, part consolidation, and tooling applications. Both designing for polymer AM and metal AM and its corresponding design guidelines will be provided. The main benefit of the course is its combined theoretical and practical approach, which provides directly applicable, “hands-on” information and insights to help students adopt AM in their daily practice.",

To be qualified for award of the subject credit, the student must submit a report summarizing the internship experience at the end of the internship. Additional presentation may be required by the hosting company. The internship should normally take place in the summer term after a student has finished the first two semesters of studies. Part-time students can decide to undertake the internship in the summer term of either the first or second year of studies. Students are recommended to seek the Professor-in-Charge's comment on potential internship opportunities before enrolling in the course.",
