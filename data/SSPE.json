It provides an opportunity for students to review the literature of their fields of specialization and to prepare for the writing of their project proposals. Examples are topics within the areas of biomechanics, exercise physiology, sports management, sports psychology, etc. A student is expected to read according to a reading list prescribed or approved by the supervisors and to confer regularly and frequently with the supervisor. Assessment is based on the completion of reading and course requirements.",
