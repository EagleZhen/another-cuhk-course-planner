Daily, ART centers use genetic information when couples undergo ethnicity screening, when donors are screened and chosen for recipient couples, to determine the cause of infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss, and when utilizing preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). However, the application of genetic information and genetic testing is often limited due to lack of knowledge by the medical providers in the ART practice. This course serves to provide basic to complex genetic information to help such practices start to fill this education gap and competently apply genetic information to improve patient care. It includes:1. Both basic genetics education and review of real time application. 2. The faculty will address current knowledge of the genetic causes of infertility 3. The latest research on and testing for infertility treatment and diagnosis4. The gamete donor and gestation carrier screening5. The PGD in clinical application6. The latest information about PGS7.
