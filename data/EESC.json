The course provides an interdisciplinary study of the Earth Systems, including natural phenomena in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere. The mechanism of these systems, associated dynamics and anthropogenic impacts will be introduced and discussed. The course also serves as a platform to understand and critically assess global environmental change, natural hazards, biodiversity loss, and the water-energy-food nexus, and explore potential technological and policy solutions to these problems. These objectives align strongly with the understanding and pursuit of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG#7 Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG#13 Climate Action, SDG#14 Life Below Water, and SDG#15 Life on Land. In addition to attending lectures, students will visit the Jockey Club Museum of Climate Change where it displays the way scientists examine past and current climate and the factors leading to current global temperature change. A geological field excursion will be another highlight of the course to demonstrate the scientific concepts applied to reveal Earth’s tectonic history, evolution and interaction among various spheres. With diverse scientific topics in Earth’s systems, the course shows students how each Earth’s system is interlocking with other spheres and, hence raise the awareness in the importance of sustainability.",

      "description": "EESC2129 is designed to provide students with fundamental geological field techniques and the application of geological and environmental concepts specific to the region of Hong Kong. The course aims to deepen students' understanding of the local geology, including its formation processes, tectonic history, and its relationship with the environment. By the end of the course, students will have acquired a solid background in local geology and geomorphology. The course emphasizes hands-on training and practical skills development. Students will learn essential geological field techniques, including map reading, gathering geological data, making field observations, and jotting geological field notes. They will also develop critical thinking skills through the analysis and interpretation of geological data. Additionally, the course includes training in life-saving skills to ensure students' safety during fieldwork. EESC2129 consists of a 10-day local field study and five pre-trip lectures. The field study provides an immersive experience where students will directly apply the knowledge and techniques learned in the classroom to real geological settings in Hong Kong. The pre-trip lectures serve as a preparatory phase, covering relevant theoretical concepts, field methodologies, and safety protocols. Following the field study, two post-trip discussions will provide an opportunity for students to share their findings, and engage in further analysis and interpretation. Successful completion of EESC2129 requires continuous teamwork and independent assignments. Students will be expected to collaborate with their peers during fieldwork, share responsibilities, and contribute to group discussions. Additionally, independent assignments will be assigned to reinforce students' understanding of the course material and encourage individual exploration of specific geological topics.Note: This course may involve physical activities and fieldwork in outdoor environments. Students are advised to comply with safety guidelines, follow instructions from instructors, and maintain appropriate fitness levels to ensure a safe and enriching learning experience.",

EESC3110 is an intermediate level course of the Earth and Environmental Sciences Programme. It covers important aspects of field geology, including sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic petrology, tectonics, geophysics and surficial processes. The principal goal of this course is to train students to recognize different lithological units and their geometries in three dimensions, and understand the related tectonic environment and formation mechanism. Class lectures introduce basic skills of reading and interpreting geological maps, using geological equipment (i.e. Compass-clinometer, GPS receiver), and producing field notes and reports. Field projects include field observation and description, techniques of field data acquisition and analysis, sample collection, and geological map compilation. Field projects also focus on surficial processes (relatively occurring on short geological time scale), which are of environmental and ecological importance. The field location (either in mainland of China or overseas) may change from year to year.",

      "description": "EESC3140 is designed to introduce students to the global distribution of elements and the chemistry of natural Earth's materials. The course focuses on understanding the chemical processes operating within the solid Earth and other planets, spanning from the past to the present. Emphasis is placed on developing quantitative and analytical skills in geochemistry. The course covers a wide range of topics, including fundamental principles of geochemical processes, thermal dynamics, phase transitions and the relationship between pressure, temperature, and composition in different geological materials, major elements, trace elements, rare Earth elements, element mobility and mineral stability, and the roles of different elements in Earth’s evolution. The course also introduces the role of minerals and rocks in supporting and influencing life and, how biological processes affect the chemical composition of Earth’s atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. Students will be trained to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the formation and interaction of materials within the Earth. Students will learn about the geochemical processes involved and their implications for potential tectonic settings and surficial processes. By studying geochemical data and engaging in practical sessions, students will develop the skills to analyze and interpret the geochemical data, allowing them to discuss paleo-environments with possible tectonic models such as seafloor spreading, subduction and mountain building regimes.",

      "description": "This course includes the science behind the global warming issue, how the public views the issue and the critical thinking needed to analyze the evidence seen in the media/articles from the point of view of scientists. The world energy use, which is considered to be the cause of global warming, and the impacts are discussed in the course. In this course, students will learn about the radiation budgets/balance in the atmosphere, possible climate forcings that can upset the energy balance, how the earth’s global average temperature is measured, why global warming is described as “the biggest hoax” in human history, observations from the ocean and cryosphere and popular environmental issues/arguments discussed in the mainstream media. Newest observations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report are included throughout the course.This course actively incorporates elements of innovation, design, global citizenship and social enterprisingness by asking the students to think innovatively but critically about possible solutions to adapt to and combat climate change and the global energy/health crisis. Different options including their pros and cons are actively discussed in class. Students are encouraged to think creatively about the problem from different angles, e.g., by standing in the shoes of climate skeptics – evaluating their “data”, how they present them, the arguments put forth by them – in order to develop a strategic approach to best communicate the issues to a variety of stakeholders. Project assignments will allow students to focus on one particular environmental issue in other part of the world, attempting to address the issue in the very different geographical, cultural, economic and political contexts from that of the students. Example projects can be “How to use geoengineering to combat climate change?”, “How can Sub-Saharan Africa secure its future food supply under the threat of climate change?”, etc. In the course, students will define and understand the problem. They shall form groups and discuss their own point of views and search information on the evidence of the corresponding arguments. They will present their ideas in class and write a self-reflection report. Each of the group will have to make an “infographic”- a layout of science knowledge learnt in the project that is easy enough for the public to understand but at the same time informative. Good infographics will be used in our OpenDay.",

EESC4119 is an advanced-level course of the Earth and Environmental Sciences Programme. It covers important aspects of field geology, including petrology, structural geology, tectonics, geophysics, and surficial processes. The principal goal of this course is to train students to recognize different lithological units and their spatial relationship in three dimensions, and to understand the related tectonic environment and formation mechanisms. Class lectures introduce basic skills of reading and interpreting geological maps, using geological equipment (i.e., compass-clinometer, GPS receiver), and producing field notes and reports. Field projects include field observation and description, techniques for field data acquisition and analysis, sample collection, and geological map compilation. Field projects also focus on surficial processes, which occur over relatively short geological timescales but play important roles in environment and ecology. The field location, whether in mainland China or overseas, may change from year to year.",

The course aims to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of plate tectonics, including sea floor spreading, subduction, and mineral deposits. Additionally, it focuses on teaching students advanced geological field techniques and their practical application in field studies. The course also addresses engineering problems related to geological factors and explores the significance of water resources within a geological context. EESC4129 incorporates a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical training. The course includes 10 lectures covering essential concepts and techniques, plus 14 days in the field and engage in onsite discussions. Students will have the opportunity to visit a geologically significant area to gain firsthand experience and understanding of the geological setting, formation processes, tectonic history, and their relationship with urban planning. This field study will provide students with a solid background in local geology and geomorphology, enabling them to comprehend the geological processes and their implications in various settings. Students will engage in a mapping exercise, where they will collect geological data, perform detailed field observations, and analyze their findings. This exercise will enhance their critical thinking skills and equip them with the ability to plan geological projects effectively. Additionally, students will receive training in life-saving skills to ensure their safety during fieldwork. By the end of the course, students will have developed a heightened awareness of the interplay between geology and urban planning, contributing to their holistic understanding of the natural environment.",

After that, this course will cover introduction and hands-on practice of the three basic processes in atmospheric simulation: pre-processing data, modeling, and post-processing data. The pre-processing process refers to the preparation of data from various sources by different techniques such as the generation of emission inventories for atmospheric chemistry modeling. It then introduces numerical modeling basics such as “model equations and numerical approaches”. For post-processing, this course offers different skills in visualization of the model output and evaluation of model output against real-world observations. This course also introduces advanced knowledge in “model coupling” and “inverse modeling”. Finally, this course provides hands-on practice on simple model development experiments. During the course, we will cover basic Linux environment commands to perform the main tasks mentioned above. Overall, students can anticipate grasping basic modeling concepts and skills from this course, which are of great value to their future careers in both academia and industry.",

It begins with the concept of model and reviewing of physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere. After that, this course will cover introduction and hands-on practice of the three basic processes in atmospheric simulation: pre-processing data, modeling, and post-processing data. The pre-processing process refers to the preparation of data from various sources by different techniques such as the generation of emission inventories for atmospheric chemistry modeling. It then introduces numerical modeling basics such as “model equations and numerical approaches”. For post-processing, this course offers different skills in visualization of the model output and evaluation of model output against real-world observations. This course also introduces advanced knowledge in “model coupling” and “inverse modeling”. Finally, this course provides hands-on practice on simple model development experiments. During the course, we will cover basic Linux environment commands to perform the main tasks mentioned above. Overall, students can anticipate grasping basic modeling concepts and skills from this course, which are of great value to their future careers in both academia and industry.",

This course will train the postgraduate students to master basic skills of reading and interpreting geological maps, using geological equipment (i.e., compass-clinometer, GPS receiver), and producing field notes and reports. Field projects include field observation and description, techniques for field data acquisition and analysis, sample collection, and geological map compilation. Field projects also focus on surficial processes, which occur over relatively short geological timescales but play important roles in environment and ecology.
