Improvement of behaviours and well-being of citizens would not naturally occur without a specific “intentional intervention”. The concept of Healthy Setting is to cultivate a healthy physical/psycho-social environment in the setting where people spend most of the time for working, studying, enjoyment of life, or for specific purposes. It is a very effective “intentional intervention” in achieving improvements in both health and well-being of citizens as it would penetrate into the wide arrays of their daily experiences. The whole concept of healthy setting is also based on striving the principles of ‘just, equitable and inclusive’ for citizen development.
