It consists of a grammatical system which reflects universal principles of linguistic organization but which shows differences when compared with the grammar of the society’s spoken language. |\n| Deafness and hearing loss | Deafness is a pathological terminology referring to loss of hearing in measurable degrees and types. It has a strong speech or spoken language undertone, interpreted usually in the context of medical intervention. |\n| Signing varieties | Signing is a cover term for a wide array of varieties which reflects at the one end of the continuum the grammar of spoken languages and at the other end the grammar of natural sign languages. Examples of signing varieties include natural sign languages, manually coded spoken languages, fingerspelling, cued speech, tactile signing, etc. |\n| Sign Language Acquisition | It covers different types of acquisition processes involving sign languages, which may be L1 acquisition of sign languages by deaf or hearing individuals in a monolingual fashion, or bimodal bilingual acquisition of both a sign language and a spoken language in early childhood or entering adulthood. |",

Students will practice transcribing some signs using the Stokoe System. |\n| Sign Language Phonetics | Some major findings of articulatory phonetics in sign languages will be discussed. |\n| Common Phonological Processes in Sign Languages | This unit presents common phonological processes and changes that have been found in the world’s sign languages. Students will practice how to identify processes that result in historical changes and sociolinguistic variations. |\n| Sequentiality vs simultaneity in sign language phonology | This unit presents the evidence that motivates a model of phonology that takes into account the sequential and simultaneous properties of signs. |\n| Handshape as a phonological parameter | This unit presents the generalizations that have been made about how handshapes are configured and constrained in sign languages and how phonological models have attempted to account for these patterns. |\n| Location as a phonological parameter | This unit looks into the subcategories of locations, their respective characteristics and how they can be represented in phonological models. |\n| Movement as a phonological parameter | This unit presents the different types of movements and their characteristics. It also reviews the controversies surrounding the phonological status of movement as an independent category. |\n| Sign language syllables | This unit discusses whether syllable-like structures can be found in sign languages and what are the supporting evidence. |\n| Issues in acquisition | This unit provides an overview of the major findings in the acquisition of sign language phonology |",

In the Hong Kong context, emphasis is on how deaf children acquire the sound segments, tones, as well as grammar of Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese on the one hand, and the acquisition of Hong Kong Sign Language in the areas of sign phonology, morphology, word order, and classifier constructions on the other. Acquisition studies of other sign languages as reported in the literature will also be covered, to support the premise that the processes of language acquisition as revealed by deaf children are universal.",

Non-manuals |\n| Critical Period | It refers to the period during which children are said to be sensitive to linguistic data for language acquisition. Language acquisition beyond this period displays diversity in ultimate attainment. |\n| Impoverished Input | Linguistic data that is supposedly sensitive enough to trigger language acquisition is neither perceived nor processed efficiently due to hearing loss. Alternatively, the so-called language data that deaf children are exposed to show intrinsic characteristics that mar sensitive linguistic input. |\n| Sign bilingualism vs bimodal bilingualism | Sign Bilingualism refers to a form of education philosophy for the deaf that promotes use of sign language in education to nurture the ‘L1’ acquisition of deaf and hard-of-hearing children. Subsequent inclusion of spoken language in the education process is taken to be supporting L2 acquisition. Bimodal bilingualism has a much stronger linguistic orientation developed within the framework of linguistic and acquisition theories. |",

      "description": "This course explores the intersection of sign language, cognition, and the brain, providing an in-depth analysis of how visual-gestural languages are processed and understood by the human mind. We will begin by examining the cognitive and neural foundations of language, comparing human language (both spoken and signed) to animal communication systems. From there, we will explore how the brain processes sign language, considering both typical and atypical language development in deaf and hearing signers.\nKey topics include sign language acquisition, the impact of linguistic and social disadvantage on language development, and the unique ways in which sign languages use space and visuospatial cognition. We will also investigate metaphor in sign language, sign language production and perception processes, and the relationship between sign language and written language processing.\nBy the end of the course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of how sign language provides insight into broader questions about language, the mind, and human cognition, while also appreciating the unique ways in which sign languages interact with cognitive processes.",

Different modes of interpreting (e.g. sight translation, consecutive interpreting, simultaneous interpreting) and different models of sign language interpreting will be discussed. Discourses commonly found in local sign interpretation will be introduced (e.g. health, education, legal, social work, business and government, etc.). As an international development, the roles of Deaf interpreters to serve a broader purpose of communication are highlighted. Students are expected to be able to compare the development of local sign interpreting to that of Mainland China, Macau, and other countries.",

      "course_syllabus": "| **Topic** | **Contents/fundamental concepts** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Modes of Interpreting | Sight translation, consecutive interpreting, and simultaneous interpreting serve different purpose in communication access. Sight translation provides instant access of written text to signers. Apart from competing in their time duration of interpreting, consecutive and simultaneous interpreting also differ in terms of its translation production clarity and appropriate use in different discourse. |\n| Models of Sign Language Interpreting | Answering the needs of service consumers, sign language interpreting models develop from helper model, machine model, communication facilitator model, bilingual-bicultural model, to nowadays ally model. |\n| Discourses and Demands | Different discourses call for different demands and qualifications of interpreters. They have to equip themselves with different knowledge, both encyclopedic and specialized, in order to relay the messages between their service consumers. Interpreters have to be alert to the register choice, as well as the intended and extended meaning implied in different discourses. On top of our everyday languages Hong Kong Sign Language and Cantonese, other languages, like English and Mandarin, might also be a different demand due to the post-colonial status of our city. |\n| Deaf Interpreters | Deaf interpreters have been introduced as unimodal interpreters in international conferences and as language expert in regional setting. The widely use of deaf interpreters has become an international trend and providing better access to the service consumers, especially for those who are Deaf-Blind, elderly Deaf, Deaf-plus, Deaf children, and Deaf foreigners. In terms of human rights empowerment, their roles also serve the purpose of Deaf individuals as language models. |",
