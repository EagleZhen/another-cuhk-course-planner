We will begin by examining the cognitive and neural foundations of language, comparing human language (both spoken and signed) to animal communication systems. From there, we will explore how the brain processes sign language, considering both typical and atypical language development in deaf and hearing signers.Key topics include sign language acquisition, the impact of linguistic and social disadvantage on language development, and the unique ways in which sign languages use space and visuospatial cognition. We will also investigate metaphor in sign language, sign language production and perception processes, and the relationship between sign language and written language processing.By the end of the course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of how sign language provides insight into broader questions about language, the mind, and human cognition, while also appreciating the unique ways in which sign languages interact with cognitive processes.",
