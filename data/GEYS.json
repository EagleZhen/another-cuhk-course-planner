Sustainable Development of Cities and Communities to Ensure Good Health and Well-being\nThis section of the course enhances students’ knowledge on impact of urban development on health and well-being by making use of concept of Healthy City to illustrate socio-economic and political determinants of health. It aims to broaden the students’ concept of health and well-being to address issues of sustainable urban development. This section focuses on 2 key SDG’s, Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3) and Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11). Other determinants for health and well-being, such as reduction of poverty (SDG 1) and reduction of inequality (SDG 10), and health justice (SDG 16), will also be discussed.\n\n4.
