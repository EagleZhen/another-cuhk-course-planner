Examples of these reactions are nucleophilic substitution, addition reactions, elimination reactions, epoxidation, oxidation and reduction reactions of organic compounds, reactions involve enols and carbanions, electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, etc. These experiments allow students to acquire in-depth understanding of reactivity, selectivity and the mechanisms of the various types of important organic reactions. This course strengthens students’ skills for carrying out organic reactions, and their experience in determining the structures of organic compounds by spectroscopic methods. After completion of this course, students should be able to carry out simple organic synthesis reactions, purify the reaction products by using the appropriate techniques, and identify the structures of the reaction products by IR and NMR spectroscopy.",

The course has two modules. First module is bioorganic chemistry: chemical structures, reactions, synthesis, and functions of biomolecules. The lecturer will first introduce four types of biomolecules, namely peptides and proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids to chemistry students, with a focus on their molecular structures, higher-order structures and organizations, and the organic reactions to synthesize or to transform these molecules in a synthetic laboratory or inside cells. Enzymes, a special group of proteins will also be introduced to the audience, together with cofactors and coenzymes as one example of proteins possessing catalytic power. The second module of the course will focus on chemical biology, including current technologies developed and selected research projects in this field. Through this course, students will be able to apply their basic organic chemistry knowledge to complicated biological molecules, and deepen their understanding on molecules in life, from an organic chemist's point of view. This course will be distinct from an introductory biochemistry course by focusing on the organic chemistry aspects of the molecules in life, i.e. molecular structures, higher-order structures, functional groups, transformations, reactions and syntheses.",

The course covers review of organic chemistry and physical chemistry; structures and combustion energy of fuel molecules; related biochemistry and enzymology; biochemical conversion processes; ethanol production from carbohydrate-based biomass; biodiesel production from lipid-based biomass; hydrogen and methane production from organic and waste products; fermentation and alkane production; chemical engineering processes of biofuel production; biofuel economics, policies, and research and development; field trip to bioenergy farm. A guest lecture from a practitioner on biofuel production industry is scheduled. Students are required to run experiments for a project and to design their own solutions to solve problems met in biofuel industry.",

      "description": "This course offers postgraduate students who are interested in the research at the interface between chemistry and biology in-depth knowledge about chemical biology. The course has three modules. Module 1 covers the chemical structures, reactions, synthesis, and functions of biomolecules. The lecturer will first introduce four types of biomolecules, namely peptides and proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids to chemistry students, with a focus on their molecular structures, higher-order structures and organizations, and the organic reactions to synthesize or to transform these molecules in a synthetic laboratory or inside cells. The course will also focus on the functions that the structures and reactivities of the biomolecules encode. Enzymes, a special group of proteins will also be introduced to the audience, together with cofactors and coenzymes as one example of proteins possessing catalytic power. Module 2 will include current technologies developed in chemical biology, and selected research projects in this field, including literature review and guest lectures based on the knowledge delivered in the first two parts. Module 3 will be guest lectures in chemical biology. Through this course, students will be able to apply their chemistry knowledge to complicated biological molecules, to comprehend chemical biology research, and to identify/solve chemical biology problems.",
