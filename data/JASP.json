Students will be able to perform an elementary study regarding Japanese culture and this will help the students to develop his/her further study in Japanese Studies.",
      "course_syllabus": "Week 1\nLesson 1\nIntroduction to Japanese culture\n:\nThis lesson explains how Japanese culture influences daily life in\nHong Kong\ntoday. The usage and the characteristics of Japanese language will also be discussed.\nWeek 2\nLesson 2\nIntroduction to the historical changes of kanji and kana in the Japanese language\n:\nThis lesson explains the historical changes of kanji and kana in Japanese language. Focus will be on why Japanese absorbed Chinese characters into their writing system and the process of how Chinese characters were converted to the modern\nkana (hiragana and katakana)\n.\nWeek 3 – Week 4\nLesson 3\nIntroduction to the phrases expressing linguistic politeness\n:\nThis lesson briefly explains the phrases expressing linguistic politeness. These include honorific expressions, expressions used in making requests, making apologies, expressing gratitude and personal opinions, giving advice and asking for permission. Emphasis will be placed on when and how these expressions are used. The relationship between such expressions and the characteristics of hierarchy in Japanese society will also be discussed.\nWeek 4 - 5\nLesson 4\nStrategies used in making requests and refusals in Japanese\n:\nThis lesson discusses how Japanese make requests and refuse the requests of others. Such expressions are often used in daily life by Japanese but are not easily understood by foreigners. Special attention will be given to:\na. the difference in behaviour between Japanese and non Japanese in making requests and refusals.\nb. how this behaviour reflects characteristics of Japanese culture.\nWeek 6 – Week 7\nLesson 5\nStrategies used in making apologies and taking responsibility\n:\nThis lesson discusses how Japanese apologize and take responsibility after misconduct such as scandals or accidents. For example, we often see the top management of Japanese companies bow to the public to apologize for their misconduct and they may even quit the company in order to take responsibility for problems. In\nHong Kong\n, it is rare to see such a phenomenon. We will discuss the mechanism of how Japanese make an apology and the effect of the Japanese way of apologizing upon social situations. Special attention will be given to the comparison of the styles of apology in Japanese and\nHong Kong\nsocieties. We will also discuss the relationship between the Japanese way of apologizing and issues related to the Sino-Japanese War.\nWeek 8 – Week 9\nLesson 6\nAmbiguity in the Javanese language\n:\nCompared with other languages such as Chinese, there are many ambiguous linguistic practices in Japanese. These include, for example, the deletion of the subject \"\nwatashi\n\" (I), the use of \"\nkoto ni\nnarimashita\n\" (become something) rather than \"\nkoto ni shimashita\n\" (I decided to do something) when talking about personal matters such as getting married, and the frequent use of intransitive verbs rather than transitive verbs. Most Japanese language learners including\nHong Kong\nlearners have experienced difficulties with these expressions and practices in their learning process. We will analyze and comment on this phenomenon.\nWeek 9 – Week 10\nLesson 7\nThe Business Manner of Japanese\n:\nThis lesson discusses how Japanese behave in business negotiations. Japanese are often criticized for not stating their true feelings and opinions. They often use expressions such as \"\nkangaesasetekudasai\n\" (Please let me think about it), \"\nkekkoo desu\n\" (It's O.K. /No, thank you) to indirectly express their opinions. We will discuss why Japanese behave in such a way and the correct way to deal with a Japanese business partner.\nWeek 10 - Week 11\nLesson 8\nJapanese language in a sociolinguistic perspective\n:\nIn this lesson we discuss the following items of importance in sociolinguistics as they appear in the Japanese language.\na. the comparison between written and colloquial styles\nb. the comparison of language usage for men and women\nc. the comparison between the standard language and dialect\nd. the comparison of language usage between the young and the elderly\ne. the comparison between formal styles and informal styles\nf. the comparison between jargon and standard expressions\nWeek 12\nLesson 9\nThe success and failure in learning Javanese language (with a focus on\nHong Kong\nCantonese speaking learners)\n:\nFirst, we will give a brief introduction to the theories of second language acquisition. Next, the factors affecting the results of the process of second language learning will be discussed. To ensure a better understanding, case studies comparing English language acquisition among Japanese and\nHong Kong\npeople will be introduced. Finally, by summarizing the above observations and the characteristics of both Japanese and Cantonese, we will comment on the difficulties experienced by Hong Kong Cantonese speaking Japanese learners.\nWeek 13\nLesson 10\nSpecial topics on Japanese 1anguage and Japanese culture\n:\nSpecial topics will be selected to help students understand the relationship between Japanese language and culture.\na.\n\"shin go ryuukoogo taishoo\"\n(New words and buzz terms Grand Prix)\nb.\n\"kotoshi no kanji\"\n(The Chinese character of this year)",

      "description": "(UGEC1271 is double-coded with JASP1160.)  This course examines the development and academic significance of various forms of Japanese popular culture such as films, comics, music, TV dramas and culinary culture, from multidisciplinary perspectives, including history, cultural anthropology, cultural studies and media studies. It aims to deepen understanding the following three facets of Japanese popular culture:1) the applicaton of cultural globalization theory in Japan; 2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries; and 3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society. Using concrete examples and grounding on representative academic writings, this course discusses the globalization of Japanese popular culture and relevant issues in indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows and media-mix. Students are trained to understand the nature and cultural implications of Japanese popular culture in an Asian context. Besides lectures, discussions and readings, this course selectively utilizes topical essays (projects), e-learning, audio-visual materials and fieldwork-based assignments as supplementary teaching tools.",

Having taken this course, students will be equipped with a basic ability to analyse cultural phenomenon in the lens of such cultural concepts as indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows, media mix, cultural colonialism and orientalism.",
      "course_syllabus": "Main Objective\n:\nThis main purpose of course is to examine the global popularization and localization of Japanese popular culture from historical, cultural and comparative perspectives within the theoretical framework of cultural globalization. It aims to indicate that the cultural flows between\nJapan\nand\nAsia\nare by no means one-way traffic and\nAsia\nhas been interacting and collaborating with the Japanese in creating, manufacturing, marketing and distributing cultural products for decades. Lectures, discussions and readings highlight different facets of cultural acculturation and transnational interaction found in Japan-Asia cross-cultural flows, such as appropriation, hybridization, global localization business strategy, the making of localized editions, the local application of Japanese formula, joint production, and the participation of foreign artists and staff. Solidly grounding on empirical data as well as theories from cultural globalization and cross-cultural studies, this course will be a pioneering teaching and learning project to explore uncharted research territories in Japanese studies, Japan-Hong Kong relations, and cultural studies.\nKey Issues and Problems\n:\nThe following key issues and problems regarding the globalization of Japanese popular culture in an Asian context will be addressed in this course within the theoretical fiarnework of cultural globalization:\n1) The idea that the influx of Japanese cultural products is a form of cultural imperialism that aims to expand Japanese economic interest and to spread Japanese value and lifestyle in\nAsia\nwill be empirically and theoretically reexamined and challenged. It shows that cultural imperialism is an outdated model in cross-cultural studies, because it fails to understand the dynamic mechanism in transnational cultural flows and cultural forces of localization and hybridization.\n2) While using \"glocalization\" (Roland Robertson uses it to refer to the localization strategy employed by multi-national companies to promote their products in different nations) to investigate the global business strategy of Japanese companies such as Sony, Nintendo, Capcom and Bandai in Asian and global markets, this course underscores the limitation of the glocalization theory in the East Asian context, as it fails to see the initiative taken by Asian artists and businessmen to creatively and selectively domesticate Japanese elements.\n3) This course uses Japanese popular culture as a mirror or text to decode social and cultural issues of contemporary\nJapan\n. For examples, themes about ethnicity, gender, social hierarchy, political ideology, and cultural identity will be examined in the lens of Japanese popular culture.\nCore Content, Structure and Selected Topics\n:\nThe course content of this course investigates the three facets of Japanese popular culture:\n(1) the application of cultural globalization theory in\nJapan\n,\n(2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries,\n(3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society. Accordingly, its structure follows the design of core content and contains the following three parts:\nPart 1: Japanese Popular Culture and Cultural Globalization: Theories and Practices\nSelected Topics:\n(a) Introduction to Basic Theories in Cultural Studies and Cultural Globalization\n(\nb\n)\nGlobalization of Japanese Popular Culture in an Asian Context\n(c) Reexamining the Cultural Imperialism, Orientalism and\nNihonjinron\nDiscourses\n(d) Indigenization and Hybridization of Japanese Popular Culture in\nAsia\n(1) Food and Fashion\n(e) Indigenization and Hybridization of Japanese Popular Culture in\nAsia\n(2) TV Programs\nPart 2: Interplay between Globalization and Japaneseness\nSelected Topics:\n(a) Nihonjinron in Japanese Movies and Alternative Mode of Globalization\n(b) The Formation of Japanese Manga and Anime and Their Hybridity\n(c) The Making of an Otaku Culture in\nJapan\nand Beyond\n(d) The Adaptation of Chinese Tradition in Japanese popular culture\nPart 3: The Global Strategy of Japanese Cultural Industries\nSelected Topics:\n(a) Glocalization of Japanese Video Games and Cyber Culture\n(b) Transnational Collaboration and Cross-cultural Themes in Japanese Movies\n(c) Japaneseness and Universality in Japanese Comics and Animated Series\n(d) Exporting and Domesticating Japanese Formula in Asian Drama and Music\n(e) Media-mix\nas\na Business Strategy in Japanese Cultural Industries",

      "description": "[This course is offered via asynchronous online mode. Students should register the course via KEEP, a CUHK eLearning platform where the course materials are uploaded.]This course aims to provide a ‘tasting’ opportunity for students who have no history of Japanese language learning before to start their first Japanese language learning. The topics in this course will cover pronunciation of ‘Kana’, simple daily life communication topics to express their favorite food, interest/hobby, shopping, places they want to go/things they want to do in Japan, etc. In order to have a better understanding of Japanese society, relevant Japanese cultural topics will also be included in this course. After completing this course, students will have basic knowledge of Japanese ‘Kana’ and be able to communicate in simple Japanese language with Japanese people on topics introduced in this course. For students who opt for further study in Japanese language, this course will provide a good foundation for them to have a smooth transition to the upcoming elementary course. On the other hand, for students who do not opt for further study, this course will also provide simple basic language knowledge for daily conversation with Japanese people while visiting Japan in the future.Students who have attended any one year exchange study programme in Japan and/or passed any level of Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) are NOT allowed to take this course.",

      "description": "This course interrogates the major institutions, ideas and historical forces that shape life in contemporary Japan, and pushes students to examine the similarities and differences in processes of modernization across societies. As students have covered the historical and sociopolitical groundings of modern and contemporary Japan, this course goes deeper into the social science of Japan by examining the major social institutions of home, school, and work to facilitate our understandings of the primary forces of socialization and organization and the dynamics of power in contemporary Japanese social life. Furthermore, it addresses the new challenges emerging within each of these spheres based on Japan’s changing socio-economic and demographic landscapes. The study of Japan challenges us to reevaluate the premises of Western social theory as well as HK-centric conceptualization, and it rewards us with fresh understandings of the transformations to modernity and the nature and direction of modern life.

      "description": "This course introduces the social scientific study of gender, sexuality, and family in Japan from the postwar to the contemporary period from a comparative perspective. As the course covers a lot of readings, writings, and discussions on the issues of gender and sexuality, students are expected to come to class prepared to discuss the readings and facilitate the class discussion. For many, Japan represents a sweeping stereotype of extreme gender norms vis-à-vis contemporary Euro-American gender norms and manifestations. Such stereotypes are employed not only by outsiders to critique the society ethnocentrically, but also by some natives as well. Both sides frequently comment on the ways gender and gendered expectations shape and even determine contemporary experiences of “being Japanese.” Furthermore, stereotypes about gender and sexuality in Japan frequently overlap with and draw from broader stereotypes about Japan vis-à-vis other Asian societies and Asian societies vis-à-vis Western societies.By identifying these stereotypes and also critically questioning what gender means and how it is being shaped in and shaping contemporary Japan, this course will offer an entry into theories of gender studies and sexuality, and also introduce tools to critically analyze cultural differences manifested in the issues of gender and sexuality while at the same time learning more about Japanese society and your own society. Moving between historical and contemporary definitions of gender, sexuality, and family to look at change and continuity of gendered life ways in Japan, the course is divided into five sections addressing issues of: 1) Defining Gender and Gender Stereotypes; 2) Gender and Social Institutions; 3) Gender Construction / Performance; 4) The Politics of Sexuality and Identity; and 5) Gender and “Marginality.” In each section we investigate cultural constructions of gender, sexuality, and family and key themes that revolve around them: identity, class, morality and life course in contemporary Japan. At the end of each section we will take time to reflect on gender and sexuality in Asia more broadly. Class sessions will consist of lecture sessions devoted to explaining the readings in context and tutorial sections for facilitating active discussions and student presentations. Assignments for the course will ask students for active participation and weekly discussion questions, a reflective mid-term essay, and a final exam.",

      "course_syllabus": "Course Syllabus\nCourse Description English:\nJapanese management is characterized by a combination of indigenous cultural influences, early postwar borrowing of ideas and creative development. Because of the success of Japanese economic development, Japanese management has become a unique and important field by itself. While Japanese management was much emulated in the 1980s and 1990s, it has also adapted and evolved according to chronological phases in its development. Changing Japanese economic needs, demographic shifts and evolving trends/lifestyles/habits seem to push Japanese management into a creative knowledge-based phase which is covered in the last section of this course. In the final analysis and in terms of application, one may develop comparative perspectives after taking this course, both internally within the different chronological phases of Japanese management as well as externally with other forms of management techniques.\nThis course introduces the historical and social development of present Japanese management practices and systems. It aims to equip students with better understanding of Japanese business people, to establish mutual understanding, and to help students learn to collaborate with staff from Japan so as to achieve common objectives.\nThe organization of the course is chronological starting from Japanese management’s basic features to revisiting its sustained and continued applicability and finally to cutting edge contemporary ideas. It is a broad survey intended for class participants with no prior knowledge of management theories or Japanese studies beyond the usual terms encountered in the mass media and some acquisitions of new terminologies. It does not pretend to be comprehensive but gives participants a broad and foundational understanding of J-management augmented by selected case studies. It is broad and foundational in the sense that the course can be divided into three phases from the basic features to recent case studies and then to the nuts and bolts of contemporary ideas.\nChinese course description:\n本科目透過日本社會發展的觀點介紹現代日本管理學的歴史。旨在提昇學生對於日本管理人員的認識，謀求與日本人建立互相理解，互相信任和互相合作的精神，進而達成共同的工作目標。\nCourse schedule\n=============================================================\nWeek 1: Basic concepts of Japanese management\nLecture:\nMandatory Reading:\n(1) Haghirian, Parissa, \"Chapter 2 Human Resource Management\" in Understanding Japanese Management Practices (NY: Business Expert Press), 2010, pp. 13-30 (17 pages)\n(2) Haghirian, Parissa, \"Chapter 4 Knowledge Management\" in Understanding Japanese Management Practices (NY: Business Expert Press), 2010, pp. 39-52 (13 pages)\nTutorial:\nThe first tutorial will go through the requirements of the course. ================================================================\nWeek 2: Basic concepts of Japanese management\nLecture\nMandatory Reading:\n(1) Haghirian, Parissa, \"Chapter 5 Entering the Japanese Market\" in Understanding Japanese Management Practices (NY: Business Expert Press), 2010, pp. 55-74 (19 pages)\nTutorial:\nClass participants will work in groups to discuss their understanding of the readings and learn to adopt the perspective of their training, expertise and interest to analyze the readings, ask questions and discuss it in the context of their research interests.\n=======================================================================\nWeek 3:\nLecture:\nMandatory Reading:\n(1) Haghirian, Parissa, \"Chapter 6 Succeeding as Foreign Manager in a Japanese Firm\" in Understanding Japanese Management Practices (NY: Business Expert Press), 2010, pp. 75-90 (15 pages)\n(2) Haghirian, Parissa, \"Chapter 7 Intercultural Challenges when Working in Japan\" in Understanding Japanese Management Practices (NY: Business Expert Press), 2010, pp. 91-106 (15 pages)\nTutorial:\nIt plans to discuss early in the course broad strategies to tackle the short essay and build on essay writing skills learnt in other modules and courses, discussing thesis statement writing skills and question writing skills for the purpose of enhancing essay writing skills.

      "description": "This course explores modern Japan, which underwent perhaps the most striking transformation of any country in the modern world. Narrowly escaping colonization, Japan transformed into one of the most important imperial and economic powers in the world. Modern Japan is also doubly fascinating for a comparative take on the great themes of modern global history: the social upheavals and transformations of capitalism and democracy, the rise and fall of modern imperialism, the experience of total war, and the spread of a mass consumer culture. This course examines the invention of new traditions and the construction of a new national identity, the rise and fall of empire, the devastation of World War II, and the astonishing postwar economic growth and puzzling stagnation in contemporary times. This course explores how people in Japan have dealt with the dilemmas of modernity that challenge us all.",

      "description": "World War II remains the most total and bloodiest conflict in world history. Fought on multiple fronts on three continents, the war witnessed a complex mesh of ideologies and war aims. It wrought unparalleled destruction and targeted civilians to an unprecedented degree. It has been the only war to date in which atomic weapons were used. The war pitted empires against each other and led to the fall of many of those global empires. This course will focus on World War II in Asia. It uses Japanese history as a window into global processes, and also places the war in its proper regional context. Beginning with World War I, this course journeys through the crisis of East Asian international relations in 1920s and 1930s to the outbreak of a multi-front war in East and Southeast Asia. It considers the war’s impact on empires and nations, soldiers and victims, and peoples throughout the region. And it explores the legacies that remain visible across the region today.",

      "description": "Though extensively influenced by ancient China, Japan has developed into one of the world’s most distinctive cultures. Japan’s remote geographic location made it possible for changes to come relatively slowly, and except for the postwar reform, most innovations resulted from the voluntary adoption of foreign cultures rather than external pressure. This course discusses how Japanese civilization, i.e. the Yamato nation, and the Japanese language were formed. How Japanese society arose through the localization of foreign cultures will be one of the major themes covered. Efforts will be made to identify nation-wide characteristics, if any, and investigate how they were cultivated over the centuries. Special attention will be paid to the similarities that can be found between the two major social reforms in modern Japanese history, i.e. the Meiji Restoration and postwar reform, and to the question of how these reforms influence Japan society today.",

      "description": "Youth cultures have played a critical role in shaping Japanese public attitudes and debates, consumer movements, and institutions in the postwar period. Japanese youth-oriented popular cultures are currently reshaping the cultural landscape across much of Asia. This course explores Japan's youth cultures and introduces the diversity of youth experiences in Japan. It further allows students to explore the influence of Japanese youth cultures in other Asian societies. The course encourages students to compare youth cultures in Japan with that of China, Hong Kong, and North America. The course will also consider the rise of transnational youth cultures based on movements of people, ideas, and images across national borders. It will explore the emergence of a Japan influenced youth popular culture in Asia as well as the particular local contexts in which the experiences of youth take on meanings for individuals.",

      "description": "This course offers an advanced seminar on Japanese popular and mass culture from anthropological perspectives. Thus this is not a survey course of different kinds of popular culture in Japan, but rather this course requires us to theoretically engage in social theories of popular/mass culture and analyze interpretations of meanings and forms of particular “popularly massified” socio-cultural phenomena in Japan.The course first provides literature on the major classical and critical theories of the “culture industry” in Europe as well as the formation of mass society in Japan. Next, we will analyze the forms and meanings of the diverse, popularly massified culture of production and consumption by examining anthropological works on Japan. Specifically, this course examines the issues of popular culture and mass culture through four different spheres: culture industries, media consumption, material culture and fandom, and globalization. Through analyzing these four spheres, the course also traces the thematic issues of gender, class, and cultural politics in the context of modernization and globalization. These issues provide the underlying structure and symbols that demonstrate how anthropologists approach a particular representation of complex popularized cultural movements under late capitalism.",

      "description": "This course aims to explore the possible motivations and political backgrounds underlying the production of films that are related to WWII in East Asia, following the end of the Cold War, that is, during and after the 1990s. The intention is to analyze whether the demise of the Cold War has provided a more favorable time for Japan, China and the US to re-examine WWII in a fresh light. The year 1990 marks a watershed for geopolitics. In that immediately prior to and after 1990, the world witnessed many historical events still thought of as the most significant in recent history, even today. Such events as regards East Asia include the Tiananmen Incident, the burst of Japan’s bubble economy, the disintegration of the USSR and the rise of China. Security concerns among China, Japan and the US changed following 1990 in that Russia is no longer thought of as being a common threat of such primary importance as was the case with its predecessor state, the USSR. There is today a renewed sense of nationalistic assertiveness that can be seen in disputes in and amongst Japan, China and the US over history, territories, military expansion and in conflict over trade between these economic giants. At the same time, in the last twenty years, there have been frequent productions of movies related to WWII in East Asia, on events where differing views of history cause controversy, such as the Nanjing Massacre, Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima. There is therefore importance in investigating to what extent these movies are a reflection of such nationalistic sentiment, as well as the extent to which the WWII theme in filmmaking for a popular market is a tool for groups harboring specific political and ideological agendas. This course emphasizes interdisciplinary research and study methods, including film criticism, history and cultural studies. Students are required to choose a related topic at the beginning of the course and present his/her ideas in the last two lessons. Based on the presentation, students are required to submit a paper of about 3,000 words in the end of the semester, indicating their appreciation and understanding of the lecture materials and required readings.",

      "description": "This course explores the East Asian philosophical and religious traditions of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism both from an internal perspective – how did each tradition represent its own values, goals, practices and methods of devotion – and external perspectives – how did the traditions spread across the East Asian subcontinent, assimilate with traditional cultural norms, and influence art and architecture. In addition to these so-called “three teachings,” we also discuss popular religion in South-east Asia, new combinatory religions such as Aum Shinrikyo and Cao Đài, and the impact of East Asian religious ideas on the West. We will also address religion in modern times, understanding how traditions continue to carve out roles for themselves in a secular world.",

      "course_syllabus": "Week 1: Introduction and Buddhism as Idea\nWhat core concepts, such as “emptiness,” “Two-truth Theory,” and the “Fourfold Noble Path,” are common to Buddhist traditions? How did the Mahāyāna idea of the “bodhisattva” differ from earlier forms of Buddhism?\nWeek 2: Buddhist Scripture\nWhat literary devices, such as simile and parable, are central to Mahāyāna literature? What is the role of “skillful means”? How do these literary and conceptual developments compare with early Buddhist texts?\nWeek 3: Human Relations as Ritual\nWhat is the role of the“holy rite” or “sacred ceremony” within the Analects? Can Confucianism simultaneously be religious and humanistic?\nWeek 4: The Daoist Body\nHow did Daoism evolve from a political philosophy to a method of internal cultivation? How was the body envisioned as a territory governed by a divine bureaucracy for meditative purposes?\nWeek 5: Empty Mind\nHow did Chan/Zen present itself as a“special transmission outside the scriptures”? What are “kōan” (public cases), and how are they used to instruct students?\nWeek 6: The World as Religious Text\nHow does Esoteric Buddhism use mantra (chants), mudra (gestures), and mandala (visualization) to theorize Buddhist practice as a form of communication?\n[Part 2: Religions in Practice]\nWeek 7: The Silk Road and the Spread of Buddhism to Korea\nBy what means did Buddhism spread from China to neighboring countries on the Korean peninsula? What sorts of indigenous religions did Buddhism encounter there?\nWeek 8: Challenges to Mainstream Japanese Religion\nHow and why did the medieval Pure Land movements in Japan segregate themselves from mainstream Buddhist thought and practice? How does Japanese “sectarianism” differ from more pluralistic approaches to Buddhism elsewhere in East Asia?\nWeek 9: Warrior Dramas and the Way of the Samurai\nHow were Buddhist ideas central to the content and theories of Japanese medieval literature? How did Buddhist ideas become a basis for the conduct and morals of Japanese warriors (samurai)?\nWeek 10: Chinese Religion as Communal Activity\nHow does popular religion in China today work to connect village temples that provide services, raise funds, and mobilize communities to participate in collective rituals, sometimes described as a “second government?”\nWeek 11: Buddhist Art and Architecture\nHow did Buddhism influence visual and material culture in East Asia in the realms of painting, garden design, and architecture?\nWeek 12: New Religions of Asia\nWhat are some of the newest religions in East Asia since the 19th c., particularly in Vietnam and Japan? How are they perceived, and what positive and negative impacts have they made on society? How have traditional religious institutions adapted to new religions’ widening influence?\nWeek 13: Zen and the Western World/Conclusions\nHow has East Asian religion impacted popular culture in the West? What are some of the pervasive images of Buddhism in Western literature and film?",

Each group will translate an English text of 2000 words into Japanese and present to the whole class a summary of the work they have undertaken in the process of planning the project, researching the topic and translating the text.\nIn general, the summary should\nintroduce the text\n(What is the text you chose to translate? Why did you choose this text? What do you particularly like about this text? What does your reader need to know about the author of the text? What does your reader need to know about the context from which the source text emerged?, etc.), and\naddress the group’s choice of translation approach(es) and difficulties encountered in the exercise in both general terms and specific to English – Japanese translation\n(What are the conventions of the chosen text type? What similar texts did you use as your reference? What difficulties did you anticipate in the translation? What theoretical approach to translation did you follow? What translation strategies and techniques did you adopt and why? Did you encounter cultural problems in your translation? What process did you follow in preparing the translation? How did you solve the anticipated problems? Are you satisfied with your solutions? Where are you dissatisfied? Who or what sources helped you?

Advisory: For Japanese Studies Majors in their final year of attendance.The Field-Research Based Project, a requirement for all JAS major students, is completed over the course of four years. Preparation for the project begins in year one and year two when students take JAS1010, JAS1050, and JAS1090. In these courses, students gain familiarity with contemporary Japanese politics, economy, culture and society. Students also learn to identify and evaluate academic arguments, locate academic sources, cite sources properly, and identify and assess basic social science and humanities research methods. In the third-year of study, students decide on their research topic and methods, and appropriately apply research methods to collect data for the project. Students who are in the fourth year of study, should have completed data collection and should be writing the paper. Students should have made efforts to speak, read, and write Japanese to achieve their research aims. Students are expected to have used Japanese for activities such as requesting assistance, conducting interviews, creating questionnaires, surveying media sources, and conducting literature reviews. The final-year project completed during the required courses JAS4601 and JAS4602 is thus the final product of the previous three years’ of preparation in both Japanese studies and Japanese language.",

Different types of discourses will be used to acquire basic but versatile skills of consecutive interpretation by stages. Trainings cover retention, anticipation, paraphrasing, reproduction, information precession, note taking, sight translation, and possibly simple simultaneous interpretation. Special attention is drawn to contrasting structural and socio-cultural between Chinese and Japanese languages.",

      "description": "Regardless of the overwhelming influence from ancient China, Japan has developed into one of the world’s most distinctive cultures. Japan’s peripheral geographic location made it possible for gradual changes to occur based on its own internal needs. Except for the postwar reform, most Japanese innovations resulted from the voluntary adoption of foreign cultures rather than external pressure from foreign countries.This course explores how the Yamato nation and the Japanese language were formed based on hypotheses in related fields. How Japanese society arose through the localization of foreign cultures will be dealt with from a cultural historical point of view. Attempts will be made to identify nation-wide characteristics, if any, and investigate how they were cultivated over the past centuries. Special attention will be paid to the similarities that can be found between the two major social reforms in modern Japanese history i.e. the Meiji Restoration and postwar reform. The course also discusses how these reforms influence modern Japan society.",

      "description": "Japanese economic growth has been one of the most remarkable success stories of the past century. Japanese business practices have emerged from Japan’s particular path to modernization and its capitalist conditions. What are the characteristics of Japanese capitalism? In what ways do capitalist economies differ from one another in their social organization, institutional embeddedness, gendered relations, and modes of governance? What are the challenges of such differences for management and economic performance in a competitive global economy? How have Japanese corporations responded to the processes of globalization and neoliberalization? In tackling these questions, we will analyze the issues of industrialization, globalization and neoliberalism as well as a broad range of topics, including those related to labor, industrial organization, the theory of the firm, management, gender, and economic reforms in Japanese society. Finally by examining the inside of the Japanese corporate world, we also learn some of the “techniques” that Japan had/has invented and introduced to the world. Thus this course challenges the common and presentist views of “Japanese business” and “Japanese corporations.” Instead it introduces the complex development of Japanese capitalism from the early 19th century to the present and examines ongoing transformations within Japanese capitalism.",

      "description": "This course offers an advanced seminar on Japanese popular and mass culture from anthropological perspectives. Thus this is not a survey course of different kinds of popular culture in Japan, but rather this course requires us to theoretically engage in social theories of popular/mass culture and analyze interpretations of meanings and forms of particular \"popularly massified\" socio-cultural phenomena in Japan.The course first provides literature on the major classical and critical theories of the \"culture industry\" in Europe as well as the formation of mass society in Japan. Next, we will analyze the forms and meanings of the diverse, popularly massified culture of production and consumption by examining anthropological works on Japan. Specifically, this course examines the issues of popular culture and mass culture through four different spheres: culture industries, media consumption, material culture and fandom, and globalization. Through analyzing these four spheres, the course also traces the thematic issues of gender, class, and cultural politics in the context of modernization and globalization.These issues provide the underlying structure and symbols that demonstrate how anthropologists approach a particular representation of complex popularized cultural movements under late capitalism.",

      "credits": "3.00",
      "terms": [],
      "description": "“Asia” is one of the core concepts of Japanese cosmopolitanism. In the modern era (19th-20th century), when the world dynamics were changing drastically, Japanese intellectuals tried to break away from the old East Asian order centered on China and put forward a new worldview to build up a modern Japanese national consciousness and regional order. The discussion of “Asia” is one of the specific attempts. This is an exploratory course that analyzes various Asian discourses from the perspectives of the history of Sino-Japanese relations, the history of East Asia, and the history of the world and discusses the process of change in Japan's understanding of Asia and the world from different perspectives, including history, ideology, politics, economics, literature, and culture.The lectures cover the Asian (East Asian) understanding of China and Japan in ancient times, the Asian view and worldview of Japan in modern times, the interaction between the late Shogunate thinkers and the times, the activities and evolution of different Asianist organizations in the Meiji period, such as the Shinyasha (振亞社), the Koya-kai (興亞會), the Asia Society (亞細亞協會), the Toho-Kyokai (東邦協會), the Genyōsha (玄洋社), and the Kokuryū-kai (黑龍會), as well as the Asian views and interactions between the important thinkers of China and Japan such as Sun Yat-sen, Li Dazhao, Fukuzawa Yukichi, Okakura Tenshin, and others. It also explores the views of post-war Japan, China, Korea, the United States, India, and other countries on the Asian/East Asian conflicts and alliances, discussing the possibilities and challenges of the integration of post-war Asia or East Asia.",
