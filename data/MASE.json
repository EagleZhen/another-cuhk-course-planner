In the modern era, human lives have become even more intertwined with materials. This course will provide an overview of the science and engineering of materials. The first half of the course will introduce fundamental aspects of bonding, crystallography, and microstructures, all of which form the building blocks of all materials. Fundamental concepts including defects, diffusion, and phase diagram will also be introduced. The second half of the course will introduce different classes of materials and their defining characteristics and physical properties: metals, semiconductors, ceramics, polymers, and composites. It will bring students to the fascinating world of materials across different length scales from atoms to devices and applications, and different time scales from a historical perspective of materials developments at the beginning of civilizations to today’s complex materials.",
