It provides opportunities for students to have a better understanding of themselves and cultivate their empathy towards others. The course also facilitates students’ adaptation to campus life and active learning through implementing and evaluating their services for others. Through engaging in service-learning activities held outside the classroom, students are expected to reflect on their roles as university students and develop a sense of responsibility as citizens in a global context. To encourage active learning, Student-Oriented Teaching (STOT) tutorials can be conducted in different modes of instruction, such as discussions, debates, seminars, buzz groups, among others. Students can decide their study topic (in relation to their service-learning activities) with their tutorial class teachers. Teachers can consider outdoor teaching (Chung Chi campus tour) or class meetings at Shen's General Education Resource Centre next to the college library, which is a cozy and relaxing place ideal for interactive classroom activities.The enrollment of this course is in connection with the 2-unit course GECC1130 “Idea of a University” or GECC1230 “Learning of Life”.",

      "course_syllabus": "Keywords:\nSupervised Project\nExperiential Learning\nProblem Solving\nIdea Exchange\nThe course is registered to the student’s timetable at Term 1 which delivery of results and class activities will take place in. Project preliminary work include pre-programme(pre-trip) study plan, consultations, participation of learning programme, data collection and analysis are carried out at late-term-2 and the Summer of the preceding academic year.\nStudents will form an interdisciplinary group of four members. The pre-programme study plan helps student to identify during-programme(during-trip) project work such as data collection, visits, interviews, oral history, etc. They should report their progress to their supervisor during the summer as well as in relevant term 1 before delivering their result and conclusion. An Interim Progress Report (IPR) Form, as a check list of research progress, should be submit to project supervisor in August.\nDuring the programme(trip), each student should write learning logs to record and reflect on their learning experiences relevant to their project topic. At the finalization stage, students will also submit a reflective essay on KSAV (knowledge, skills, attitude and value) and collaboration with teammates.\nStudents are expected to demonstrate the integration and application of the concepts and insights obtained from the learning programme. Different methodologies may be applied, such as literature review, survey, oral history, photovoice, interviews, field study, etc. Students will demonstrate their problem-solving skills and interdisciplinary collaboration, present their work in both oral and written form, exchange ideas with other groups in a rationale manner under a seminar context. Do read thoroughly the learning outcomes and grade descriptors.\nPossible Schedule:\nPhase 1 – Preparation and Planning: preceding 2nd Term (e.g. Y2T2)\nJan to Feb – Apply for a designated / recognized summer learning programme and undergo the selection process.\nMar – Course pre-registration (subject to programme offer), form a group, identify a project topic.\nLate Mar to Early Apr –1st meeting with course supervisor.\nApril to Before Departure of Trip– Submit topic description and study plan.\nPhase 2 – Inquiry and Analysis (carry out research): preceding Summer (e.g. Y2 Summer)\nParticipate in learning programme.\nConduct study, write learning logs, fulfill requirements specific to learning programme.\nMake appointment for consultations – seek advice, report progress.\nSubmit Interim Progress Report (IPR) Form.\nPhase 3 – Closure and Result Delivery: 1st Term (e.g. Y3T1)\nSep – Prepare presentation and report.\nSep to Dec – Presentations and discussions at class lessons (Two Saturday half-day seminar).\nSep to Dec – Submit project report, reflective essay and intra-group peer evaluation form.\nThe possible schedule in this section is for illustration only. The actual implementation plan is subject to the schedule of the learning programme, timeline of JASP, recommendation and requirement by individual supervisor as well as the nature of individual project.",

      "description": "This is a student-oriented teaching (STOT) capstone course for senior year students. Students will form an interdisciplinary team to conduct a small group research on topics of interdisciplinary nature, current affairs, cross-disciplinary knowledge or daily life issues. With preliminary work and most of the research being carried out in the second term and the summer of the preceding academic year, students are enrolled to the course in term one, normally in the 4th year of study (Y4T1), where students will deliver an oral presentation, exchanging ideas with one another in a seminar context and submit written works.This course cultivates knowledge and skills in problem solving, critical thinking and value judgment; nurtures appropriate attitude and techniques in cross-disciplinary collaboration, rational and contributive teamwork as well as analysis with multiple perspectives.Advisory: 1. This course is intended for senior year students: a. Course registration at Term 1 of the graduation year (e.g. Y4T1),  pre-registration in Term 2 of preceding year (e.g. Y3T2). b. Students admitted to Senior-Year Places who will complete their undergraduate programme in 2 years should make pre-registration in Y1T2 for course registration in Y2T1. c. Students enrolled in an undergraduate programmes of more than 4 years of study (BChiMed, BEd, BNurs, MBChB), should normally follow the same schedule in 1(a) of taking this course in their 4th year, instead of their final year (5th or 6th year).2. Students must pre-register with the College in Term 2 of preceding year (e.g. Y3T2) and conduct most of the research work required in the summer.3. Students should refer to “possible schedule” at below section “Syllabus” for preparing wisely your study plan across the preceding term, the preceding summer and the course registration term (e.g. Y3T2, Summer & Y4T1).4. Students of case 1(c) opting for taking this course later than the 4th year of attendance must notify the College GE Office before the deadline of the pre-registration period in Y3T2. To take the course in later year (e.g. Y5T1 or Y6T1), it has the same requirement of pre-registration with the College in Term 2 of preceding year (e.g. Y4T2 or Y5T2). However, students of this category have to be aware of the teaching/clinical practice, fieldwork placement, professional examinations, etc. in their Year 5 or above when considering not following the normal schedule.",
