Students will familiarize themselves with the multi-channel mental process and learn to manage their processing capacity in SI. By progressing from sight translation to simultaneous interpreting, students are guided from the safe and familiar written text to focusing on the dual-audio processing of SI. By the end of the course, students should have both a conceptual understanding as well as hands-on experience with this important mode of conference interpreting.",

Students will build on skills acquired at the introductory level and work on more challenging speech types in various subject domains. They will build up their knowledge and language proficiency in major domains, including political, economic, social, environmental affairs, among others. They will also be exposed to real-life working conditions to enhance their resilience. SI with text will also be introduced and trained as a regularly used form of interpreting in the professional practice. Mock conferences and study trips will be organized, as appropriate, to enhance skill and professional development.The language combination of the course is Putonghua and English. Classes are conducted in the simultaneous interpreting laboratory.",

      "course_syllabus": "This course will teach students about the post-editing of machine translated texts. Students will be instructed in the processes of correcting and revising the output of machine-generated translation in order to meet a standard comparable to that of a human translator (or other more specific quality criteria). Machine translation can process a large amount of data much faster than traditional translation, so in order to save time and money, translation companies are increasingly turning to machine translation technology. This output, while more accurate than ever, still requires editing. Post-editing therefore represents the future of the global translation industry; a future in which most text types will be translated by machine translation tools, then edited by trained post-editors. As such, post-editing skills are highly sought after by language service providers.\n\nThe course will first offer an introduction to the theory of machine translation alongside the evaluation of machine translation quality and effectiveness. Specialist software will be utilised to compare a range of machine translation engines, helping students to understand the advantages and disadvantages of machine translation. Students will then be introduced to the post-editing of machine translation, including various editing strategies designed to improve the raw output of machine translation software (light edit, full edit, etc.). This will help students to appreciate the requirements of professional post-editing tasks and workflows in the global translation industry.\n\nThe language pairs used in this course will be Chinese to English and English to Chinese. This course is designed as a companion course to TRAN6601 Introduction to Computer-aided Translation, as such, knowledge of computer-aided translation software would be beneficial but is not a prerequisite.\n\nThe course will be divided into two main components:\n\n1. Machine translation. First, we will take a simple and mostly non-technical look at how machine translation operates, from statistical machine translation to neural machine translation. The various pros and cons of machine translation will be considered, alongside discussion of which text types are most suitable for MT and what kinds of common mistakes the post-editor should look out for.\n2. Editing. We will start by discussing the pre-editing of machine translation, which involves preparing a text for translation by following certain stylistic or terminological guidelines in an effort to improve the quality of the output. Post-editing techniques such as “light” post-editing (making a text understandable) and “heavy” post-editing (increasing quality to a publishable standard) will be discussed and practiced. Different genres and text-types will be handled during class practice and in assignments, as well as strategies for tackling larger projects. Students will be expected to complete a group project that requires working as a team to produce a longform post-edited translation and present their findings in class.",
