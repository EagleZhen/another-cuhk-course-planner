For many years the development of such qualities has been recognized as being of high importance by the senior management of the academic, non-government and commercial organizations. Leadership is best learned by doing. This course will explore and examine leadership theory and practice through experiential learning in the outdoor and a different setting rather than studying mainly in a classroom. It provides students with a structured, supervised programme of participation in the practice of leadership and teambuilding. The goal of this course is to help students acquire practical skills and judgment to develop their leadership qualities.

It places students in a simulated situation and coaches them to be responsible for dealing with problems, challenges and routine skills when training students to be practical, sensible and helpful in our society. The theory of outdoor experiential training for leadership and team building is that leadership skills can be honed and team spirit developed by taking students into the great outdoors. This concept features both physical and mental exercises.\n\nKey theories about leadership will be introduced with their practical applications for leadership including the follows:\n1. Defining leadership\n2. Leadership and management\n3. Nature of leadership and leadership styles\n4. Action-centred leadership\n5. Leadership checklist\n6. Time management for leaders\n7. Motivation for leaders\n8. Creativity at work\n9. Leadership tasks\n\nThe course includes a mixture of lectures, interactive tutorial, group discussion and challenge course which is specially designed to enhance personal development and team spirit in the sense of problem solving, caring colleagues and coping with the difficulties through participating in a series of challenging and exciting outdoor activities in an energetic and fun-filled atmosphere.\n\nStudents will be divided into small groups. Through job rotation, each student has opportunity to take a leading position to complete a leadership task. The training involves facilitators leading the students through activities, encouraging them to reflect on experiences and helping them to transfer the knowledge and skills learned to a working context. It focuses on enhancing self-awareness, changing attitudes, building teams and improving inter-personal skills.",

The ability to connect horizontally is “design thinking”. Individuals equipped with the ability to think as a designer will be able to innovate, tackle complex problems and manage changes in real life situations.\n\nWith “design thinking” or by “thinking as a designer”, students can begin to understand how our world has come to its current form through intended and unintended design. Knowing that the only thing that is not designed, is nature, humans need to learn where to draw the line. By acquiring a designer’s mindset in looking at the world, each person can do one’s part to be a responsible and conscious prosumer of design. This includes utilizing eco-friendly artifacts and designing one’s learning, career and life experience on this planet in a responsible way.",

It is not confined to the technical training of political and policy analysts, but broadened to the liberal education of citizens who have the knowledge, attitudes and competence to participate in public affairs. The purpose of the course is to raise the awareness of students towards social issues, nurture their ability to identify and analyse the pivotal aspects of the issues, and most importantly, encourage the students to form their own opinions and to suggest solutions. In line with this purpose, the course is issue-oriented, with controversial issues cutting across the discussions and reflections. Apart from classroom teaching and discussion, there will also be field trips to government agencies as well as non-government organizations, in which students will have opportunities to directly exchange ideas and opinions with government officials, community leaders and ordinary people.",

Throughout the course the students are expected to master the basic concepts in political analysis and be able to apply them to analyse real-world problems. More specifically, the students are expected to develop some basic knowledge as to the different features of civil society, social movement and governance.\n2. By taking this course, the students are expected to be familiar with a wide range of practical problems besting the ordinary citizens in Hong Kong and the Mainland China. The students are encouraged to consider and observe the ways in which civil society can help to tackle and resolve these problems, and whether too much hope is placed on civil society.\n3. In recent years the places like Hong Kong, Mainland China and Asia in general has been marked by the rise of social movements and new social movements. By taking this course, the students are expected to develop the skills to analyse the rationale behind the social movements and their impact on governance. Perhaps more importantly, the students are expected to have the opportunity and ability to reflect on the ‘optimal’ relationships between government, private corporations and the social activists of a new generation.\n4. This course is intended to develop the students into active and considerate citizens. In order to become good citizens, they must master generic skills in terms of articulating and communicating complicated ideas and analytical results effectively in both verbal and written formats. These skills are unlikely to emerge automatically. They have to be deliberately nurtured. In this course, through face-to-face interaction with social participants, and a round of presentation and discussion exercises, the students are offered a well-organised setting where their analytical and communicating skills can burgeon.\n\nStudents will achieve the following desirable learning outcomes of the College General Education Programme:\n\n1. understand the College motto and develop positive attitudes and values;\n2. recognize the common concerns of the contemporary world;\n3. demonstrate social enterprisingness in protecting the environment and serving the community; and\n4. demonstrate the ability to think independently and innovatively.",

In addition to covering fundamental concepts and methods related to social issues and policy analysis, the primary goal of the course is to develop students' knowledge, attitudes, and abilities to participate in public affairs. Therefore, the course will focus on social issues, using controversial topics throughout the curriculum to stimulate students' interest and discussion regarding public affairs. Besides classroom learning, the course will arrange for students to participate in service activities with government agencies, public institutions, and non-governmental organisations, allowing them to experience the operations of government and non-profit organisations and have opportunities to learn and grow from these experiences. These experience will also help students to understand the SDG #11 to make the cities and human settlement inclusive, safe , resilient and sustainable.",

Throughout the course, students are expected to master the basic concepts in policy analysis and be able to apply them to analyse real-world problems. More specifically, the students are expected to develop some basic knowledge of different features of civil society, social movement and governance.\n\n2. By taking this course, the students are expected to be familiar with a wide range of practical problems besting the ordinary citizens in Hong Kong and the Mainland China. The students are encouraged to consider and observe the ways in which civil society can help to tackle and resolve these problems, and whether too much hope is placed on civil society.\n\n3. This course is intended to develop the students into active and considerate citizens. In order to become good citizens, they must master generic skills in terms of articulating and communicating complicated ideas and analytical results effectively in both verbal and written formats. These skills are unlikely to emerge automatically. They have to be deliberately nurtured. In this course, through face-to-face interaction with social participants, and presentations and discussion exercises, the students are offered a well-organised setting where their analytical and communicating skills can burgeon.\n\nStudents will achieve the following desirable learning outcomes of the College General Education Programme:\n\n1. Describe connections and integrate knowledge across fields\n\n2. Understand the meaning of service-learning and reflect on the experience learnt through different types of community service\n\n3. Foster comprehensive awareness in the sustainable development goals\n\n4. Develop leadership skills, and be able to collaborate and communicate effectively in teamwork\n\n5. Identify and apply sustainable development tools and strategies to address social problems to achieve SGD #11",

Students will apply theoretical concepts to real-world situations through practice, enhancing their understanding of leadership principles. The course also includes elements of service learning, such as activities related to environmental protection like trail restoration, providing students with practical team leadership and hands-on experience that positively impacts the community and the environment (SDG #15 Life on Land).\n\nParticipating in trail restoration not only fosters teamwork and communication but also cultivates a sense of responsibility toward environmental protection. Students will learn how to navigate challenges, communicate effectively, and motivate their peers as they work toward a common goal. Additionally, this experience will enable students to reflect on their own leadership styles and adapt them to different contexts, further strengthening their ability to lead diverse teams.\n\nMoreover, by sharing this knowledge and experience to the public, students will help cultivate a broader culture of environmental awareness and community involvement. They will prepare workshops to share insights gained from service-learning activities, such as trail restoration. These workshops may include hands-on demonstrations, discussions on sustainable practices, and the importance of environmental protection. By collaborating NGOs, students will also host clean-up trail workshops, tree-planting activities, or exhibitions, which not only educate the public but also actively involve them in environmental action. These service learning activities will inspire a collective commitment to sustainability and social responsibility , creating lasting environmental awareness within the community.",

The process begins with empathy, where students understand community needs through interviews and observations. They then define the problem based on their findings. Implementation involves putting the viable solution into action, requiring collaboration and project management. Throughout the process, reflection is encouraged to help students understand the impact of their work and foster personal growth. This course not only enhances problem-solving skills but also ensures that solutions are tailored to meet real community needs, promoting meaningful and sustainable impact. Students will be linked with various NGOs and social enterprises to design solutions that assist beneficiaries. For example, students will participate in Elderly-oriented Home Transformation Service and apply design thinking knowledge to assist the elderly in redesigning their homes and enhancing the living quality of the elderly.\n\nVarious project groups within the course focuses on different sustainable development goals, such as no poverty (SDG#1), elderly needs, healthy lives and well-being (SDG#3). Through service-learning activities, students and community members are expected to enhance their cohesiveness and deepen their concerns for the local community (SDG＃11).",
