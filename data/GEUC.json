      "description": "Wine weaves in with human history from its very beginnings and developed into one of the foremost products of civilization. Great wines have their roots in the customs, traditions and history of their home ground. Celebration of vine and wine is often associated with the legend and worship of Bacchus, the wine God. Similarly, the origins of fermenting and drinking wine in China go far back in time. Tu Kang 杜康is a household name. It is no doubt that wine occupies an important place in the culture and life of the Chinese people. This course leads students on a cultural journey on wine around the world. It introduces to students a historical perspective on wine and its role in society. In addition, it provides students with basic knowledge on wine appreciation, and the relationship among wine, food and culture. Students can develop the skill to taste wines of common production regions and grape varieties. They can develop a positive understanding on various aspects of life through appreciation of wine culture.",

For many years the development of such qualities has been recognized as being of high importance by the senior management of the academic, non-government and commercial organizations. Leadership is best learned by doing. This course will explore and examine leadership theory and practice through experiential learning in the outdoor and a different setting rather than studying mainly in a classroom. It provides students with a structured, supervised programme of participation in the practice of leadership and teambuilding. The goal of this course is to help students acquire practical skills and judgment to develop their leadership qualities. On completion of this course, students will be able to identify and achieve their goals at a comparatively earlier stage in life.",

The ability to connect horizontally is “design thinking”. Individuals equipped with the ability to think as a designer will be able to innovate, tackle complex problems and manage changes in real life situations. With “design thinking” or by “thinking as a designer”, students can begin to understand how our world has come to its current form through intended and unintended design. Knowing that the only thing that is not designed, is nature, humans need to learn where to draw the line. By acquiring a designer’s mindset in looking at the world, each person can do one’s part to be a responsible and conscious prosumer of design. This includes utilizing eco-friendly artifacts and designing one’s learning, career and life experience on this planet in a responsible way.",

Besides classroom learning, the course will arrange for students to participate in service activities with government agencies, public institutions, and non-governmental organisations, allowing them to experience the operations of government and non-profit organisations and have opportunities to learn and grow from these experiences. These experience will also help students to understand the SDG #11 to make the cities and human settlement inclusive, safe , resilient and sustainable.",

Students will apply theoretical concepts to real-world situations through practice, enhancing their understanding of leadership principles. The course also includes elements of service learning, such as activities related to environmental protection like trail restoration, providing students with practical team leadership and hands-on experience that positively impacts the community and the environment (SDG #15 Life on Land).Participating in trail restoration not only fosters teamwork and communication but also cultivates a sense of responsibility toward environmental protection. Students will learn how to navigate challenges, communicate effectively, and motivate their peers as they work toward a common goal. Additionally, this experience will enable students to reflect on their own leadership styles and adapt them to different contexts, further strengthening their ability to lead diverse teams.Moreover, by sharing this knowledge and experience to the public, students will help cultivate a broader culture of environmental awareness and community involvement. They will prepare workshops to share insights gained from service-learning activities, such as trail restoration. These workshops may include hands-on demonstrations, discussions on sustainable practices, and the importance of environmental protection. By collaborating NGOs, students will also host clean-up trail workshops, tree-planting activities, or exhibitions, which not only educate the public but also actively involve them in environmental action. These service learning activities will inspire a collective commitment to sustainability and social responsibility , creating lasting environmental awareness within the community.",

The process begins with empathy, where students understand community needs through interviews and observations. They then define the problem based on their findings. Implementation involves putting the viable solution into action, requiring collaboration and project management. Throughout the process, reflection is encouraged to help students understand the impact of their work and foster personal growth. This course not only enhances problem-solving skills but also ensures that solutions are tailored to meet real community needs, promoting meaningful and sustainable impact. Students will be linked with various NGOs and social enterprises to design solutions that assist beneficiaries. For example, students will participate in Elderly-oriented Home Transformation Service and apply design thinking knowledge to assist the elderly in redesigning their homes and enhancing the living quality of the elderly. Various project groups within the course focuses on different sustainable development goals, such as no poverty (SDG#1), elderly needs, healthy lives and well-being (SDG#3). Through service-learning activities, students and community members are expected to enhance their cohesiveness and deepen their concerns for the local community (SDG＃11).",
