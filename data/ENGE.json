      "description": "Using language is one of the most creative and distinctive of all the activities that make us human. Perhaps we are most aware of this kind of creativity when we read imaginative literature, whether classic or contemporary; but we also experience it directly in our own everyday language use. This course aims to foster new understandings of the various ways in which language influences and shapes the experiences of life common to all humanity. Students learn to analyze and appreciate a wide range of literary, linguistic and cultural phenomena, including the works of Hong Kong authors/poets who express themselves through English. From a linguistic perspective, we examine the ways in which language is structured and used creatively for different purposes in both local and global contexts. From a literary perspective, we study not only the traditional genres of fiction, poetry, and drama, but also film, song, and life writing. From a cultural perspective, we investigate how different texts and media are part of how we construct the world and define our evolving sense of self and our common humanity.",

      "description": "This course provides you with the communication skills necessary to perform various academic and non-academic tasks in both online and offline contexts. It demonstrates how differences in audience, communicative purpose and medium shape the content and structure of various written and spoken genres. It also discusses different patterns of development such as narration, description, exemplification, and persuasion, and the importance of thesis statements and topic sentences in organizing ideas. To help you develop an awareness of the structural and stylistic differences of various genres, you will produce a personal reflective essay, a literary analysis paper, and a persuasive presentation, that will be presented in various print, face-to-face and digital formats, using both linguistic and multimodal resources. Through a process oriented approach, you will be producing outlines and drafts of these writing tasks, get feedback, and learn writing strategies such as using sensory details, choosing active, specific verbs, and employing cohesive devices. Recognizing how technology shapes communication practices in diverse ways, this course also draws attention to the affordances and constraints of digital tools such as WordPress, Blackboard, Zoom, and social media platforms.",

      "description": "This course builds on the foundational communication skills introduced in ENGE 1310 and helps you develop the competencies necessary to conduct effective research. It examines the existing structures and conventions of various print and digital genres such as journal articles, blogs, infographics, and YouTube videos. It also discusses different patterns of development such as definition, problem/ solution, comparison/ contrast, classification and division, and the importance of maintaining an appropriate register and style. To help you produce and consume knowledge in creative and critical ways, you will construct an abstract, an annotated bibliography, a literature review, a video, and a research article that discusses an issue in applied linguistics. These texts will be constructed for real world audiences and will involve the use of various multimodal resources. Through a process-oriented approach, you will be producing outlines and drafts of these writing tasks, get feedback, and learn writing strategies such as signposting, using signal phrases, and constructing parallel structures. Recognizing the increasing importance of technology in producing and consuming knowledge, this course also discusses the use of various digital tools such as search engines, reference management software, blogging and video editing platforms.",

Students will analyse some one-act plays in English from a dramaturgical point of view, workshop them in small groups and perform them on the stage before an audience. They will be introduced to the adaptation of texts for performance, to the technical aspects of casting, acting, directing and stagecraft. Emphasis will be placed on communicative aspects of acting, including pronunciation, intonation and voice production. Drama in Performance will complement other major courses in communication, literature and language study.",

Does a hero have to be good? Do they have to be strong? Do they have to win in the end? Do we have to like them? This course will address many of these questions in relation to many different texts from a wide variety of media: from one of the earliest surviving texts of the ancient world, The Epic of Gilgamesh to the recent global phenomenon, Game of Thrones. We will look especially at the way heroes are shaped by the monsters that they do battle against. Some monsters are fought with fists and swords, but others must be defeated through other means for they lie within the hero himself.",

The course outlines a broad perspective of the genre of crime fiction from its earliest incarnations to modern-day TV drama. We will explore a variety of different forms of crime fiction, and how the genre more generally reflects cultural, historical and social issues. The study material for this course will consist of literary texts, TV series, and films drawn from the popular cultural canon. Topics we will discuss include conspiracy, serial crime, trauma, the epistemology of clues, history and crime, and the criminal mind. The course begins with a historical overview of detective fiction, and concludes with a creative workshop on how to write a detective story. Students with a taste for murder, crime, and suspense — and above all the desire to solve enigmas and mysteries — are welcome to attend this course.",

      "description": "This course takes a closer look at the intimate connections between literature and human rights. The history of human rights has always been accompanied by literary texts; conversely, some of the most important literary texts in the world have focused on human rights issues. People who have suffered abuse and human rights violations have often articulated their painful stories in a variety of literary genres — in the hope of being heard, achieving recognition, bearing witness to events that have defined their lives. These stories thus constitute important documents around which rights campaigns and communities are built. During the course, we will look at the history of human rights literature, as well as various case studies — including Stolen Generation narratives in Australia, narratives by women who were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army, political dissident narratives, and more recent refugee literature. No previous studies in literature needed to take this course. Students interested exploring the relevance of literary imagination and narrative for human rights discourse are welcome to attend this course.",

This course offers a broad look through literary history to understand the enduring value and diversity of literature. For each lecture, we will look at a literary masterpiece — from antiquity to the present — and address three main issues: A) the work and its historical context; B) how to read it; and C) themes that make the work relevant in contemporary society and in our everyday lives. The course is designed as an introductory survey of literary works that have had a major impact throughout the ages. Issue A) is intended to give students a sense of the work’s impact in its own time; B) is designed to provide students with the conceptual tools and methodologies to understand a classic work of literature; while C) will provide students with an opportunity to make connections between their own individual concerns and those of the great characters of literature. At the end of the course, students will have encountered some of the most esteemed classics in literary history. No previous studies in literature needed to take this course. Students interested in discussing the ideas, ideals and values of classic literary texts are welcome to attend this course.\n\nNB: students are expected to read only EXCERPTS of the works. However, it is expected that students will read at least ONE full-length work (for the course essay).",

We will begin by tracing the origins of this enduring pop fiction, from the hero’s journey in antiquity to the outbreak of the Second World War. We will also explore the moral ambiguity and mixed values of some of the most memorable characters. Furthermore, we will examine revisionist approaches to the superhero genre that respond to the hopes and disillusionments of the contemporary era. Topics covered will include good and evil, power and identity, and justice and responsibility. You may also have the chance to design your own superheroes. It is hoped that by the end of the course, you will develop new ways of reading superhero narratives as uniquely modern myths.",

      "description": "This course studies the relationship between words on the page and audio-visual moving images on the screen by focusing on the adaptations of classic English novels of the nineteenth century. We will look at several nineteenth-century English authors who have been particularly popular with screen adaptations: Austen, Dickens, and Hardy. By close reading of their texts and careful viewing of the big and small screen adaptations of these novels, we will consider the specificity of the textual and the visual media in the narrative, thematic, and aesthetic aspects. The course will explore the interaction between literature and film/television in terms of forms and stylistics, and make broader cultural and historical enquiries about the issues of gender, class, nationhood, and nature that will illuminate nineteenth-century literature in general and its relevance to the present.",

      "description": "Focusing on song writers and performers from the USA, this course introduces students to the art of popular song lyrics of the twentieth century. In the process of studying American popular song lyrics, students will learn about such musical genres as “the blues,” “gospel,” “tin pan alley,” “folk,” “country,” and “rock and roll” as well as the elements of American history that give rise to each of these types of musical lyrics. Since one of the course elements is the relationship of musical lyrics to musical sound, we will spend considerable class time listening to popular songs , paying attention to the way a lyric’s meaning is conveyed through such elements as vocal style and musical arrangement.",

Students should also demonstrate their knowledge of some key events in twentieth-century American history and the basic structures of the American political and economic systems. The development of these abilities of knowledge and comprehension is primarily demonstrated through two in-class tests.\n\n2. Build on and apply their knowledge of American history and literary form (i.e. popular song lyrics) to create two critical, analytical essays that synthesize the diverse approaches to understanding culture represented by historical and literary analysis. Such essays will also display students’ skill at integrating issues relating to social class and gender into their historical and cultural analyses.\n\n3. Display high-level critical thinking skills in class tests, in essays, and in seminar discussions. Such skills include speaking articulately and purposively about the course material, showing an awareness of the stylistic and expressive range of American popular song lyrics, and evaluating the relative significance of developments in the genre.",

We will read major texts that problematize and hypothesize the relation between self and community; immunity and toxicity; power and medical interventions; faith and healing; and knowledge and narrative. This course aims to widen the “medical” beyond the scene of clinical encounter through close engagements with critical theory about the body and the self as embodied subjectivity. In our readings, we will discuss and debate the meaning and practices of responsibility, endurance, and imagination that challenge assumptions about the illness experience, caregiving, and the production of medical knowledge.",

      "description": "This online course is designed to help students make the most of education abroad by enhancing their intercultural awareness and sensitivity as they explore the host environment and interact with locals and other international students. Except for a few pre-departure tasks, all work is done online while students are abroad. Through exposure to relevant theories, readings, and other resources, this course aims to help students develop a deeper understanding of what it means to be interculturally competent and global-minded as they immerse themselves in the host culture. While they critically reflect on their second language/intercultural interactions and share their experiences with peers, they are encouraged to become more curious, open-minded, and actively engaged in the world around them\n.",

In order to explain why this is the case, the course will seek to understand the nature and function of myth, and the complex uses to which they are put in order to explain some of our most pressing questions: How did we all begin? Where are we? Who are we? Why is there so much wrong with the world? What’s the solution? Where will we go when we die? How will it all end? Although the concept of myth might seem outdated in modern secular culture, by drawing comparisons between the ancient and contemporary worlds, students will be encouraged to see how myth-making of some kind is as inevitable and innately human as the questions which prompt it. The course will begin by establishing some archetypal similarities between myths – from myths of Creation to myths of Apocalypse – and then consider myths from specific cultures – including Greco-Roman, Scandinavian, and Chinese – before considering the appeal of myth in contemporary popular culture, especially The Lord of Rings, and Game of Thrones.",

      "description": "This course explores the complex relationships between authors and the various forms of authority that they have written under, or written about. It will broadly consider the ways literature has been deployed to challenge socio-political authority, as well as to affirm, publicise, and legitimise it. More specifically, it will consider: literary representations of authority, literary attempts to deconstruct authority, political attempts to banish literature, literary strategies of speaking to authority, the use of literature to legitimise authority, and the ways literature can establish its own authority. Students will be encouraged to recognise that, though literature is popularly seen as a means to challenge authority, it has often also been used as an agent of authority. In fact, the words “author” and “authority” come from the same Latin root, auctor meaning “an originator, causer, doer.” What similarities are there between authorial authority and socio-political authority? To what extent do they make competing claims to legitimacy? And when do their separate claims to legitimacy come into alignment?",

The history of song has always been closely connected with the oral tradition in literature; conversely, the musicality of literature owes much to the song tradition. Gospel, Negro Spirituals, Folk Music, the Bard Tradition, the Sean Nós tradition, the ballad and the lyric form in poetry, as well as popular music and musicals will all be examined in this course. The course will examine the different song traditions in their social and political contexts. The course will also include a song-writing element. There will be a song-writing workshop with a well-known local songwriter. Students will be asked to write a song in any genre of their choice (folk song, protest song, spiritual song etc.) and then to have that song performed either by themselves or someone else in the class. No previous studies in literature or music are needed to take this course. Students interested in exploring the connections between song and poetry and between song-writing and the poetic craft are welcome to attend this course.",

We will explore a variety of existentialist positions—including those of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre, and de Beauvoir—to understand how existentialist thought constitutes an important intellectual context for many themes in modern literature, including authenticity, alienation, and anxiety. Authors to be discussed include Kafka, Dostoevsky, Ionesco, Camus, Beckett and others.

The Restoration period will deal with the heroic tragedy and the comedy of manners. Representative works by some of the following authors will be covered: Kyd, Marlowe, Tourneur, Webster, Middleton, Ford, Dryden, Otway, Wycherley, Etherege, Congreve, etc.",

The second half of the course will explore twenty-first century plays and their relationship to some of the most pressing questions of the contemporary period. As students become familiar with the major styles, concepts, and figures of modern and contemporary drama, they will also develop an awareness of the historical contexts from which the plays emerge and the social and cultural issues to which they respond. Finally, students will investigate drama as both a written text and a performance event and, through their readings, discussions, and assignments, gain an appreciation of its uniqueness as a “living” art form. The course readings will include plays by the following authors: Henrik Ibsen, Bertolt Brecht, Arthur Miller, Samuel Beckett, Caryl Churchill, Ayad Akhtar, Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig, and Lynn Nottage.",

      "description": "This course takes as its premise that environmental writing is environmental action. Environmental writing is also political engagement (biopolitics, as it were) as the ultimate aim of environmental writing is to effect policy change to protect, nurture, and sustain the environment and humankind.\n\nIn this course, we will explore how to use different modes and genres of writing to effect environmental change. We will first examine the major elements of environmental writing through the exploration of different modes and genres, including children’s books, blogs, essays, poetry, songs, social media, Apps, newspaper articles, and posters. We will then examine the major environmental issues we are facing globally and in Hong Kong, and examine how environmental writing is currently being used in Hong Kong to engage the public and effect change. We will also investigate public awareness of the major environmental issues facing Hong Kong, to develop an understanding of how we can engage the public more effectively through writing. Finally, we will engage in our own environmental writing by creating three pieces of environmental writing, each examining the same environmental issue through a different type of writing.\n\nKey questions this course explores:\n\n• How can we use writing to raise awareness of environmental issues and effect environmental change?\n• What are the most pressing local and global environmental issues we face today? How is environmental writing currently being used in Hong Kong to engage the public and the government to respond to these issues?\nHow can we use writing more effectively to engage the public and effect environmental change?",

In the first part of the course, students will be introduced to the concept of ‘world Englishes’ and examine different theoretical frameworks for conceptualizing the evolution of new varieties of English. The course then examines relationship between Hong Kong English and Hong Kong culture from cultural, social, historical, and educational perspectives, particularly in relation to and juxtaposition from Cantonese and Putonghua. The second part of the course examines both spoken and written features of HKE, including grammar, discourse particles, vocabulary, and pronunciation, as well as the practices of code-mixing and code-switching. This section of the course also focuses on the social impact of the use of these features in Hong Kong culture. In the third part of the course, language attitudes and ideologies towards ‘standard’ language varieties (for example American and British English) in relation to HKE will be explored. The course will also examine the relationship between use of HKE and social identity as well as gender in Hong Kong culture.",

Forensic linguists are like the Sherlock Holmes of language – they offer their expert opinions about linguistic evidence in the legal process. This course introduces some major topics in forensic linguistics, including authorship analysis, speaker identification, trial discourse, plagiarism and collusion, and linguistic evidence in cybercrime. High profile cases where forensic linguists have contributed to legal investigations will be discussed. Students will also be introduced the methods and tools commonly used in forensic linguistic analyses of spoken and written data. No prior knowledge of law is required.",

      "description": "(UGEC2189 is double-coded with ENGE2600.)\n\nAlthough English has long spread around the world, the consequences of this spread are only now beginning to be appreciated by speakers in diverse cultures and societies. English has changed the world, impacting specific local cultures in both positive and negative ways. But English has also been localized and acculturated, made to express the realities of diverse cultures and societies, and so the language has been changed in turn. The discourse of world Englishes aims to re-imagine our understanding of the language. The difference between error and innovation can no longer be decided by reference to ‘ownership’ of the language. Additionally, the language is beginning to be a medium of the expression of identity for more and more people in very different social and cultural contexts. World English must be pluralized, which is why we think in terms of world Englishes. This course is split into two sections. The first section will introduce you to issues in the discourse of world Englishes: innovation, variety, creativity, globalization, etc. The second section will look at specific case studies in different cultures and societies, and will focus on Asian Englishes, e.g. English in Singapore, China, and Japan. Different Asian cultures have distinct historical experiences with English, leading to different levels of cultural penetration (e.g. in popular culture) and depth of function (e.g. in business and law). The second section looks at different examples to explore their specific cultural engagements with the English language, but also to identify what they have in common: Japan English and Singlish develop in very different cultures, but the course with emphasis comparison as well as contrast.",

Many have celebrated English as a global language, and the course will consider both positive and negative possibilities that will be investigated using specific examples later in the term.\n\nHistories of English: Crystal, ‘Why a Global Language?’, from *English as a Global Language* (Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp.1-27.\n\nThis week looks back to some of the important histories of how English became a global language, particularly the connections with capitalism and colonialism. It will explore the charge that English today is a form of linguistic imperialism.\n\nMistakes and Creativity: Quirk, ‘Language varieties and standard language’, *English Today* 21 (1990), pp.3-10.\n\nWhat do people look for when learning a language? This week wonders why, if we would never imagine World Russians or World Chineses, it seems important to accept World Englishes. We will ask if English still has clearly defined centres of authority, or whether it is now dispersed and plural.\n\nStandards: Modiano, ‘International English in the Global Village’, *English Today* 58 (1999), pp.22-27.\n\nThis week’s discussion will focus on the need for standards, and question whether our standards should come from native speakers. Many aspects of international life (scientific discourse, aviation) currently depend on English, but perhaps native speakers are not well placed to help develop these standards. We will think about why that might be true, and how we should test Englishes in future.\n\nEnglish in Asia: Kachru, ‘English as an Asian Language’, *Links and Letters* 5 (1998), pp.89-108.\n\nThe focus of the course shifts this week to Asia as a specific example (or series of examples) of the World Englishes. In some ways, English does not appear to belong in Asia, and yet it has clearly been accepted, and we will explore the different ways English functions and has penetrated cultural life.\n\nSingapore: Ho, ‘“I’m not west. I’m not east. So how leh?”’, *English Today* 87 (2006), pp.17-24.\n\nSingapore allows us to think about the general issues clearly because it is a restricted example. Everyone is familiar with Singlish, but what exactly does Singlish show us about the cultural life and social development of this relatively young city-state? The week examines different and sometimes contradictory aspects of English in Singapore.\n\nJapan: Stanlaw, ‘The dynamics of English words in contemporary Japanese’, from *Japan English* (Hong Kong University Press, 2004), pp.11-37.\n\nShifting attention from former British colonies, this week explores Japan as an example where English seems to depend on another native speaker country, the United States. However, if we ask how Japanese society and culture actually uses English, far from being dependent on native speaker standards, we see independent creativity.\n\nChina: Hu, ‘Why China English should stand alongside British, American, and the other “World Englishes”’, *English Today* 78 (2004), pp.26-33.\n\nGiven the rise of China, it is obvious to ask, does China even need English? And does it need a specific China English? Exploring varied examples, this week considers the long history of English in China and some possible futures, in particular of Putonghua alongside English.",

In addition, this course reviews the role of individual differences in L2 English learning such as learners’ first language, the onset age of L2 English learning, language learning aptitude, and motivation. This course aims to lead students to understand the relationship between theory and research, and thereby generate pedagogical implications to English education in the Chinese/Asian contexts.",

Students will be introduced to basic theories, research methods, and analytical tools in sociolinguistics. They will also be given opportunities to investigate the link between language practices and social factors (e.g., ethnicity, gender, and class). Topics covered in this course include code-switching, language variation and change, language in the media, styles, identity, language attitudes, as well as language policy. Examples will be drawn from a wide range of social contexts, with a focus on the English language. Sociolinguistic topics in Hong Kong are given particular consideration.",

Focusing on but not limited to English, this course aims at developing students’ sensitivity to the English lexicon and enabling them to apply linguistic principles in morphology, syntax, and semantics to the systematic description of English words. The course covers the notion of word meaning, the various lexical relations among words, the historical origin and development of the English vocabulary, the major word-formation processes in English, the nature and pervasiveness of figurative language, and ways English words are used in particular contexts.",

Students will take advantage of different writing tasks to polish their descriptive, narrative and analytical writing skills. They will also learn to appreciate and apply different tones and styles for different workplace writing purposes. Through working on a feature report, students will also become more competent in research, analysis and the organization and presentation of ideas. In addition, students are encouraged to capitalize on the small-class environment by taking a proactive role in class discussions and presentations. The job interview and panel discussion exercises also provide students with opportunities to enhance their oral skills. It is hoped that by the end of the course, students can become competent and confident users of English across a variety of contexts.",

In this course, we will explore the topic of education and representations of the teacher in literature by focusing on fiction and drama from various historical and cultural contexts. The course will examine issues which are both socio-cultural and literary, and which will include: the impact of education and teachers on individual development and growth as represented in the texts; the ideological implications of education and teachers; and a comparison between the ways education is valued in the East and the West. It will also analyze the socio-historical contexts behind the works, in order to understand how these helped shape the portrayals of education and teachers in them. Some of the questions the course will tackle are: What does education have to do with literature? How does the representation of education and the teacher figure vary across writers, time, place and culture? What are some of the assumptions behind and implications of these different portrayals? And what relevance does thinking about education and the teacher in literature have on literature students?",

      "description": "This course aims first to introduce students to autobiography, one of the most popular forms of writing in the contemporary world. It will raise such questions as, why has this kind of narrative been so attractive to writers in cross-cultural situations, such as Chinese-Americans? The course will focus specifically on a group of (mainly American) immigrant autobiographers who write about the experience of living between a first language and English. They raise a range of fascinating questions about language and identity. Students will be asked to reflect on these questions and on the similarities and differences between these writers’ lives and their own experience in Hong Kong. The course will aim to teach students how to approach, analyse and theorize about autobiographical narratives. Students will be given opportunity to develop their analytical skills in essay-type responses to the prescribed texts. They will also be given opportunity to develop their narrative skills in their own life-writing, using the prescribed texts as models. Both forms of written exercise are designed to extend, as well as test, students’ understanding of autobiography as a genre.",

It does so in order to demonstrate the diversity of writing emerging from the multiple and diverse contexts present in the continent. Although primarily interested in writing in English, this course may also explore works in translation to bring into sharp relief the heterogeneous and variegated nature of the contemporary African novel. The focus on contemporary writing from the continent (read as works published within the last 10 years) means that writers other than those typically studied on such courses are to be read. The emphasis here is on the introduction of new writers to students, and the socio-historical contexts in which they write. To this end, students will enrich their understanding of world literature. Although not required, those who have taken ENGE3250 “Other Literature in English – An Introduction to African Literature” prior to this course will be in an advantageous position.",

As such, Edward Said’s (borrowed) notion of (hegemonic/colonial) discourse and Helen Tiffin’s notion of postcolonial counter-discourse will prove to be fundamental concepts of study.\n\nModule 2 Mozambique\n\nAgain, following a short history of the struggle for independence and the subsequent civil war that has plagued the post-colonial generations of Mozambique, this module reads Mia Couto’s The Tuner of Silences (2012) in order to think through the idea of trauma. To this end, the notion of trauma as elucidated in the work of Kathy Caruth is examined.\n\nModule 3 Angola\n\nOndjaki’s Granma Nineteen and the Soviet's Secret (2014) is read in the context of the Soviet intervention in Angola during the 1970s and 1980s. Here, though, critical attention is given to the role played by children in building the post-colonial state.\n\nModule 4 South Africa\n\nThe final module of the course reads Lauren Beukes’s science fiction novel Zoo City (2010) in the context of the radical political changes in South Africa since 1990. The main discussion point here is the extent to which one can claim that the genre of science fiction is a product of its time of composition or, put another way, the extent to which science fiction is rooted to a political reality.",

      "description": "This course examines the various ways in which London has been represented in a selection of diverse contemporary novels. Through both the close-reading of specific passages from the set novels and a general engagement with secondary theoretical material, it will become clear that the city continues to be represented in many different ways. From this observation emerges the realization that London is in fact, and has always been, an assemblage of very different Londons. It is this important observation that leads to the key conclusion of the course – no act of representation can ever fully capture its object of enquiry and, because of this, what has been chosen to be represented is always the product of a political decision.",

More engaged students should be able to compare and contrast certain aspects of the different representations of London, while the most engaged students should be in a position to theorize London, and urban space more generally, as a complex of contradictory forces. In so doing, they will be able to reflect broadly on the significance of the inherent limits of representation in the context of literary studies.",
      "course_syllabus": "Module 1 High London / Low London\n\nThrough reading Ian McEwan’s novel Saturday, this module explores the very different Londons that are traversed by the characters of Perowne and Baxter. For Perowne, London is the bastion of learning, civilization, and – quite literally – life. For Baxter, London is a place in which he must survive. His violent and criminal ways paint a very different picture of the city in which Perowne lives. From this though, one is introduced to the complex interweave of learning and violence that is a constant present in the very fabric of civilization.\n\nModule 2 Black London / White London\n\nSam Selvon’s novel, The Lonely Londoners, gives an intimate portrait of the first-wave immigrant experience of London. It is an image of the city that stands in stark contrast to that held by the native population. The way in which such communities work quietly and unseen beneath the daily operations of the city throw into sharp relief the very different London enjoyed by those native to the city. In this way, this module discusses issues of race and power in the city.\n\nModule 3 Old London / New London\n\nPenelope Lively’s novel, City of the Mind, gives entryway to the thoughts and speculations of a London architect who is responsible for redeveloping the so-called ‘edgelands’ of London. In addition to prompting questions over the significance of the complex temporalities at play in the London cityscape, this novel also demands that one take a position on the nostalgia vs progress debate that such redevelopment inevitably encourages. In doing so, this module introduces the notion of the neoliberal city.\n\nModule 4 Real London / Unreal London\n\nThe course concludes with Neil Gaiman’s Neverwhere, a magic realist novel that renders literal a ‘London below.’ It is a novel that stresses the banality of day-to-day.",

Today, due to the rampant digitization of hundreds of thousands of texts and radical developments in the accessibility of statistical analysis packages and platforms, the literary critic has been emancipated from working in only this way. This course introduces you to the field of computational literary analysis, which is to say a new way of engaging literary texts that takes advantage of such developments. By way of practice-based learning, you will learn to use the basic functionality of R – the leading language and platform for statistical computing and graphics in the humanities – in order to ask very different questions of literature to those that you typically learn to ask on an English literature programme. Importantly, the answers that you receive to such novel questions might just surprise you...",

      "description": "This course will study literature that represents visual arts or, ekphrasis. The term ‘ekphrasis’ can be broadly defined as verbal representation of visual arts and has become a vibrant field of study for a few decades. We will look at some most famous ekphrastic texts from the beginning of Western literature to this day, focusing on poems evoking either actual or imaginary artworks, but branching out to ekphrasis in fiction and new media as well. In the process, we will reflect on the evolution of the term ‘ekphrasis’ from a rhetorical device to a site of rivalry and on to a mode of encounter between the verbal and visual medium. The course will explore interactions of multiple media while foregrounding characteristics of each medium.",

      "description": "This course introduces students to the history and methods of documentary poetry, focusing on both critical appreciation and creative practice, and offering opportunities to conduct their own practice-based creative research. Documentary poems represent a public event or historical moment by incorporating news accounts, photographs, legal records, or other archival materials into poetic writing. In this course, we’ll explore why documentary poetry is increasingly popular among contemporary poets who seek to make an impact in public conversations. The course traces the ways contemporary poets build on the tradition of documentary poetry, and asks how documentary practices are changing as public and private archives become more available through digitization. In order to explore new approaches to generating creative work ourselves, the course alternates several practicum-style skills workshops with writing workshops and seminar-style discussions of assigned readings. Over the course of the term, we’ll combine poetry-writing, visual arts, and literary journalism approaches with archival research and digital humanities skills, making our own original documentary poetic projects using compositional tools ranging from scissors and tape, to digital image manipulation software, to computational poetry programs. Previous experience with the course tools is not required; the only prerequisite is an interest in language, history, and how we remember our world together.",

      "description": "This course looks at how comparisons can be made between languages with respect to their sound systems, lexical-semantic structures, sentence patterns, and pragmatic properties. Through systematic analysis, students gain understanding from research findings in language typology, language universals, and language acquisition. This course focuses on the basic characteristics of English and Chinese, and some salient contrasts between them. The approach is largely descriptive without assuming prior knowledge of theoretical syntax. The course also considers how comparisons between languages may help students associated with problems of translation and language teaching/learning.",

      "course_syllabus": "English 3670 is an introductory course on some fundamental issues in analyzing written and spoken texts. Given that\ndiscourse analysis is concerned with the systematic and careful examination of a variety of texts, this course will be\norganized according to the various ways linguists may interpret the notion of text.\nThis semester, we begin with a general review of discourse analysis as a field of linguistic study. Then, we follow that\ndiscussion with an overview of various rhetorical and linguistic approaches to the analysis of texts as written discourse,\nexamining non-fiction (essays) and literary texts. Our stylistic analyses of writing includes the study of rhetorical aspects\n(aims, purpose, rhetorical situation, style, discourse blocs, modes of development, voice/persona, tone, attitude, and\nreadability) and syntactic matters (i.e., lexical, phrasal, and clausal use). With an understanding of this approach, we use it to\nanalyze student-written essays; in addition, we consider what our findings may suggest about the texts and their writers,\nwith a view to identifying strategies for possible rewriting and revising.\nMoving from text as written discourse, we adopt a broad notion of the term text as both written and spoken discourse. Primarily\nusing the work of text-linguists, we consider structures “beyond the sentence.” That is, we now view the idea of a text as\nany passage, either spoken or written, of whatever length, that forms a unified whole; and we consider what makes a text\n“good” or “successful” in terms of information flow (the way ideas are dispersed throughout a text) , coherence (global\nconcern that indicates a text is unified), and cohesion (local or surface concern that serve to link one idea and sentence to\nthe next one in a text). Again, once we complete some cohesion and information flow analyses, we look at practical ways\nwe might apply some of the key ideas in teaching and learning situations in Hong Kong.\nFinally, we conclude with the notion of text as talking—oral exchanges. We will analyze naturally-occurring language in use, i.e.,\nconversational analysis and pragmatics. To do so, we will cover such concepts such as the Gricean maxims and the\nCooperative Principle (rules and conditions which speakers abide by in effective or “happy” exchanges), implicature\n(indirect meaning), speech acts (social act performed by the uttering of certain words), as well as associated phenomenon\n(e.g., framing, turn-taking, overlap, interruption, adjacency pairs, etc. ). Our study of text as talk will enable us to explore\nhow and why people “do” things with words, sometimes successfully and sometimes not.\nBy the end of the course, we hope to have a better understanding of how discourse analysis reveals to us the intricacies of a\ntext as well as enhances our knowledge of how such analysis can strengthen our abilities as language users—speakers and\nwriters.",

      "description": "There are two constant properties of language: variation and change. Languages vary in form across geographic space and social groups, and linguistic forms evolve over time, adapting to the society in which they are embedded. It makes sense to study these together because of their intricate links: if a language undergoes different transformations in different areas or subgroups, then variation results. As such, studying language change can help us to understand variation, and the nature of linguistic variation provides evidence as to how language changes. The course will focus on variation and change as a window to understanding the nature of language. It will cover topics related to these two properties such as language attitudes, historical change, and language contact. A sizeable number of case studies will be drawn from English. To strengthen the links between theoretical knowledge and practice, students will work hands-on with sociolinguistic data and attempt to analyze them using the framework of language variation and change.",

      "description": "Recognizing how technology has dramatically revolutionized not only the way we learn but also the way we work, communicate and interact with one another, this course examines diverse digital literacies that have become critical for agentive participation in the new social order. As people move fluidly across digitally-mediated spaces, how they negotiate their linguistic and semiotic resources shapes the way they construct their identities, acquire knowledge, and expand their social networks. Drawing on New Literacy Studies, this course demonstrates how digital literacy is not a neutral, technical competence, and that digital practices develop within broader social, political, and cultural contexts. Online spaces are circumscribed by competing and colluding ideologies, shaping new forms of inequality and social fragmentation. To respond to these issues, this course discusses the need to develop both functional and critical digital literacies to navigate and transform an increasingly technologized world.",

      "credits": "3.00",
      "terms": [],
      "description": "This course aims to cover some of the key poetic texts of the English Renaissance in order to explore two of their ongoing preoccupations: love and death. This course will explore the ways these texts use two aspects of the human experience to consider the nature of what lies beyond the human: the ideal, the metaphysical, and God. Where the love poetry of the period frequently idealizes the beloved into a kind of a divinity, Renaissance poetry which ruminates on the nature of mortality frequently does so under the eyes of a God who is, by turns, vengeful and merciful, benevolent and indifferent. While this course is thematic, it also covers many of the formal preoccupations of English Renaissance poetry. Some of these include: imitation, pastoral, paradox, metaphor, and epic form. Poems by Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare, Donne, Herbert, and Milton will be covered. These are some of the most important figures in English literature, but whose language and chronological distance make them daunting to many students. This course will not only make them more accessible, but it will teach students methods of close reading which will give them the skills to read other such difficult texts in the future.",

The length and complexity of the work make it ideally suited for the kind of focused consideration that this course would provide. Some of the themes covered will be: the idea of literary imitation; the poet as prophet; the nature of sin; how to write about the ineffable; the power of persuasive language. These themes (and many more) are central to Paradise Lost, but are equally the concern of other texts by Milton as well as other writers in the period. Where possible, these additional works will be considered in order to shed light on Paradise Lost and to flesh out its complexities. Paradise Lost has also been the subject of a wide variety of literary critical approaches – reader response, new historicist, psychoanalytic – and these too will be considered over the duration of the course.\n\nThere will also be a significant emphasis placed on reading aloud in this course. Typically, a lecture will contain an hour of literary analysis from me followed 45 minutes of reading aloud performed by me and the students.

      "description": "This course will focus on one seminal work of Western literature: Dante’s Inferno. The length and richness of this work make it ideally suited for the focussed, semester-long consideration this course will provide. Some of the themes covered will be: the concept of Hell, the nature of Sin, the poet as prophet, the medieval understanding of the cosmos, the uses of allegory. These themes not only exist in the Inferno, but will be substantiated and extrapolated by references to many of Dante’s other works, including Vita Nuova, Monarchia, and the Convivio. These other works, together with details of Dante’s political life, biography, and historical period will be brought to bear on the text as we read through it. Emphasis will also be put on the various literary critical approaches which have been taken to the text, including historicist, feminist, and psychoanalytic. Students are encouraged to take ENGE4120 Reading Paradise Lost either before or after taking this course.",

In this course, you will hone your skills in a particular genre (poetry, fiction, life writing, or dramatic writing) by receiving sustained, detailed feedback from a workshop leader and your peers in a focused, intimate setting. Our small class size will allow us to study and practice the techniques of creative writing with a rigor and intensity impossible in a larger lecture course. You will practice drafting and revision strategies; learn to give and receive constructive feedback; and produce a substantial, revised, and well-polished portfolio of your creative writing. You will also learn professionalization skills including preparing your work both for publication and for further study in the field of creative writing. Our main texts will be each other’s writing, but we will also read and discuss craft essays and published creative works, and become familiar with the several main models of creative writing workshops, their histories, and the communities with which they are associated. You do not need to feel “advanced” in your writing to take this writing-intensive course, but you must have taken at least one course in the Department’s Creative Writing Stream, and you must submit a writing sample for pre-approval by the instructor.",

It includes a survey of phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic structures of language, thus enabling students to investigate established theoretical premise for the linguistic description of natural languages and describe general grammatical properties of language universals in the light of the theory established. This course also equips students with some analytical tools and techniques for linguistic analysis and provides practice in using these scientific ways to discover the organizing principles underlying a language.",

This course will explore these questions by examining the concept of fiction, how it is manifested in various genres and forms, and what role it plays for writers and readers in contemporary society. Tracing its historical development, we will investigate the concept of fiction as a crucial dimension across time in various communicative contexts, including but not limited to literary discourse. Through analyzing examples ranging from novels and storytelling to non-fictional genres, including autobiographical discourses, documentaries, social media, and political speeches, students will learn how to evaluate and appreciate dominant perspectives within fiction theory, including panfictionalism, similarism, separationism, speech act theory, and possible worlds semantics. Students interested in gaining the theoretical and analytical tools to understand the many uses of fiction, its roles, effects, and potential consequences in contemporary society are welcome to join the course.",

      "course_syllabus": "This course will take a specific, committed approach to the teaching of literature, one which uses the tools and concepts of literary stylistics and cognitive poetics. Very often, approaches to teaching literature, whether at the school or university level, are rather vague and pay little or no attention to the actual language of literary works. Students are often left rather puzzled as to what is expected of them and what they are meant to ‘get out’ of literary works. The stylistics and cognitive poetics approach to teaching literature gives a concrete orientation to literary pedagogy. It must always start from the students’ own spontaneous responses to a literary work, whether a poem, short story, novel or play. There can be no question of merely teaching students how to carry out some kind of ‘dry,’ pointless, linguistic description of a literary work. They must be led from their own experiences of a work on to a linguistic and, as we shall see, psychological analysis that helps them to see what it is in the work that gives rise to their own experiences of it. This linguistic and psychological analysis can then further enrich these experiences themselves and lead on to a further round of analysis. This cycle of experience and analysis can then be repeated until it is felt that the work in question has been adequately, or at least significantly, dealt with.\n\nClearly, if someone is to be equipped to carry out this kind of teaching, they must themselves have an adequate knowledge of stylistics and cognitive poetics. This course will therefore both teach this knowledge to its students and investigate how they themselves can then use it to teach their own students, actual or potential. Although stylistics is concerned with the linguistic details of texts, it is important to understand that it is concerned with far more than just that. It has developed over the last thirty or forty years into an exploration of how people read and respond to literary works. This exploration draws upon the tools of linguistics and psychology to see how our minds construct the imaginative worlds of literature. There is always far more to a novel or poem than just the language on the page, though that language is of course our starting point for constructing the novel or poem’s imaginative world and so does itself require close attention. Although this course will be using tools drawn from linguistics and psychology, no particular background in either of these disciplines is presupposed or needed. All the three major forms of literary discourse, poetry, drama and fiction, will be dealt with.\n\nA major question of pedagogy is always of course to what extent a teacher should make explicit to their students the knowledge base that they themselves are using in their teaching, that is, just how much of this knowledge base should made be explicit and how much should be left implicit in the actual teaching itself. The balance between explicit and implicit teaching will depend to a very large degree of course on the age and level of the pupils being taught. This issue will be continually addressed throughout the course and ample opportunity will be given for the course’s students to explore it in their mid-term and final papers, which will include options for designing teaching courses of various kinds. Another pedagogical issue that will be addressed is that of using the stylistic and cognitive poetics approaches to literature to combine second language learning with the study of literature in a second language. Second language students have a more explicit knowledge of the grammar of the language they are studying than mother tongue students and this itself is a great advantage in using the stylistic approach; above all, however, a stylistic and cognitive approach to literature in a second language offers great opportunities for deepening second language students’ knowledge of the second langue they are studying, English for example, and their appreciation of its grammatical, lexical and, through the study of poetic metre, even its phonetic subtleties.\n\nThe basic framework for the study of stylistics and cognitive poetics will be provided by a, freely available, Web based course designed and created by Professor Mick Short of the University of Lancaster. This is an interactive course with lots of exercises for students to do. It is important to grasp that doing stylistics is at least as much a matter of the practical analysis of texts as it is of theoretical exploration. Students will be able to work on the Web-based course in their own time. The classroom sessions will consists of lectures by the teacher that will go more deeply into the issues raised in the Web-based course, together with the practical analyses of texts selected by the teacher.. Students will be divided into small groups for the purpose of these analyses. The combination of in class, practical analysis and the interactive stylistic exercises in the on-line course should provide students with plenty of ideas and materials for developing teaching programmes and tools of their own.",

      "description": "In the context of a world that was beginning to understand the power of “big data,” Franco Moretti introduced the notion of “distant reading” to the field of literary studies. A method of literary scholarship that embraced the technological explosion at the end of the twentieth century, Moretti’s distant reading looked to transcend a literary studies that he thought of as dominated by the “theological exercise” of close reading – which is to say the “very solemn treatment of very few texts taken very seriously.” Distant reading attempted (attempts) to make sense of thousands of texts at the same time. It asks questions that only a survey of tens of thousands of texts can answer – how does the thematic concern of western literature change over the decades… or over the centuries? And not just the thematic concern of the canonical literature we all know, but all western literature (or as much of it as we can recover today!) Such questions cannot be answered by the individual scholar but, as Moretti understood, they can be answered with the aid of computation. This course introduces you to the debates provoked by Moretti’s ideas and then moves on to show you how distant reading is practiced today. By way of workshop and project-based learning, you will be introduced to the statistical analysis platforms that computational literary studies scholars use today. You will then learn how to use this software in order to generate your own distant readings of a corpus of texts.",

Evaluation refers to the systematic gathering of information for purposes of making value judgements about language learning programmes and the participants in these programmes. The methods of enquiry include observations, interviews, meetings, questionnaires, and testing. Public English proficiency examinations, both local and overseas, will be critically assessed. Key ideas in testing will be covered: validity and reliability; tests of global proficiency and of separate skills; particular problems with tests of listening and oral English; tests of communicative competence.",

The concept of face will be discussed alongside Politeness Theory.\n\nIn Week 4 the importance of the ‘Other’ will be introduced with reference to intercultural communication.\n\nWeek 5 will introduce three discourse analytical approaches: Conversation Analysis, Ethnography, and Critical Discourse Analysis.\n\nWeek 6 will focus on Critical Discourse Studies and will introduce the importance of the question ‘cui bono?’, ‘who benefits?’\n\nWeek 7 returns to the concept of the ‘Other’ and how we create and maintain our identities through discourse\n\nIn week 8, we look at gender. How it is represented in discourse and what the challenges to such representation have been.\n\nIn week 9, students look at the critique of discourse analysis from a queer perspective. This introduces the notion of normativity and demonstrates the ways in which discourses themselves can be liberating and damaging.\n\nWeek 10 addresses the fact that discourse is not solely linguistic: it is multimodal. The social semiotic approach looks beyond the linguistic sign.\n\nIn week 11 we will look at advertising discourse and use the insights gained in earlier weeks to analyse various aspects of it.\n\nIn week 12, legitimation is identified as an all-encompassing concept that brings together all the aspects of the course.",

      "description": "This course provides an overview of the discipline of cognitive linguistics and its application in second language teaching. Cognitive linguists understand the language that we encounter every day as input from which we draw inferences about form-meaning relationships, typical patterns, and schemata. The course addresses core concepts in this area of study including: prototype, perspective, categorization, image schema, figure and ground, metaphor, metonymy, entrenchment, embodied cognition, gesture, construction grammar, attention and salience, and contingency learning. The course discusses how cognitive linguists design pedagogical methods and stimulate learners to explore the deeper meanings of grammatical forms.",

Beyond being a set of skills that support the needs of the knowledge economy, digital literacies are understood as practices that address new modes of productivity, representation, and sociality. Through the interplay of human and non-human interactants, technology has reshaped identities, communities, and relations of power, enabling social mobility, while also constructing new forms of inequality. By discussing current theory and research around digital literacies, this course illuminates how technology continues to transform the social landscape and examines the implications of these changes on language and literacy learning and the conceptualisation of 21st century competences.",

      "description": "Recognizing how second language acquisition (SLA) does not just involve cognitive, linguistic or psychological processes, this course examines how it is bound to and shaped by the social context in which these processes occur. By focusing on the social dimensions of L2 acquisition and learning, this course provides an overview of research strands such as Vygotskian sociocultural theory, language socialization, culture, identity, investment, and critical issues of race, ethnicity, gender, and social class. Because L2 acquisition and learning is mediated, embodied, situated and socially gated, multilingual learners continually negotiate their linguistic and semiotic resources as they navigate different contexts and perform diverse identities. By examining how the micro level of social activity is indexical of macrostructures of institutions, language policies, and cultural norms, language learning is ineluctably intertwined with issues of power, ideology, and inequality. This course weaves together these ideas into an integrative perspective of L2 acquisition that enables a critical understanding of real-world issues of language learning and teaching.",

      "description": "This course is designed to help students have a firm grasp of the fundamental theories of second language reading and thereby equip improved research and teaching skills. It begins with a discussion on the nature of reading and the differences between reading in first vs second languages. Then, various models of reading comprehension will be reviewed, including process models (bottom-up, top-down, and interactive) and component models (background knowledge, grammar, vocabulary, etc.). This course then reviews cognitive aspects of reading such as readers’ working memory, the relationship between reading rate and reading comprehension, and the impact of L1 orthographic system on L2 reading. In addition, this course delves into the pedagogical aspects of second language reading, such as the use of graded readers based on readability indices, the relationship between second language reading and second language acquisition, and lastly, how to better utilize tasks and technology in teaching second language reading.",
