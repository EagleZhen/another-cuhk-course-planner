The ability to connect horizontally is \"Design Thinking\", which is the bridge between creativity and innovation, combining divergent and convergent modes of problem discovery and problem solving to integrate user-experience, technology tools, and business models to create values.By acquiring a designer's perspective in looking at the world, students can learn to appreciate what it means to \"think out of a box\" --- the thinking style that transcends traditional management control and disciplinary mindset. They can create more alternatives beyond one’s own disciple to foster more systemic and holistic implementation. This course is for students who not only know how to solve problems but know what problems to solve.",

Through classroom learning, case analysis, team work and field work, students will have a good understanding on the foundations of the above topics, and be able to apply psychological tools to understand current issues such as social innovation, social entrepreneurship, and everyday problems.",

Since pursuing an entrepreneurial endeavour has to overcome obstacles and deal with challenges in novel and uncertain situations, we must transform and give new emphasis to skills commonly used in other problem-solving situations. Indeed, a number of new processes and accompanying languages have to be invented for entrepreneurial practices. Additionally, because changes happen fast, the skill sets essential for entrepreneurial success must be matched with the latest technological and societal development, and to the needs of different student cohorts. By the end of the course, students should become more effective and confident in implementing their entrepreneurial plan or innovation project.",

      "description": "A business model is a logical and internally consistent representation of the design and operations of a business, capturing the essence of how it will be focused and demonstrating how an interrelated set of decision variables will be addressed to create, deliver and capture value. By one definition, a business model consists of four interlocking elements: • The customer value proposition (how does the firm create value for a customer) • The profit formula (how does the firm capture value for itself while providing value to the customer) • The key resources required to deliver the value proposition to the targeted customer • The key processes that allow a firm to deliver value in a repeatable and scalable manner. Business model innovation is focused on the design and development of new and unique business models that, by definition, challenge accepted conventions in a given industry about how to create and deliver customer value while making sustainable profits for the entrepreneur and his investors. This course will explore the range and diversity of existing perspectives about business models and the tools of analysis essential to their understanding. We will learn to analyze and evaluate existing business models and pursue a logical and internally consistent approach to the choice and/or development of an appropriate business model for a new enterprise. The application of the course frameworks, tools and techniques will be illustrated with case studies and evaluated in a semester project involving the development of an innovative business model for an entrepreneurial venture.",

They are also strongly recommended to pursue an idea initiated in other courses and/or occasions such as competitions and internship. It is ideal that an idea is conceived, developed and eventually realized throughout the EPIN journey.
