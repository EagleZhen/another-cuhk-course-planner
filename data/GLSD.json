      "description": "This course is designed to introduce students the key concepts, issues, challenges and trends essential to understand the process of integrating global network. More specifically, this course offers an overview of the changing paradigm of global communication by studying the interrelation between cultural, economic, political, social, and technical dimensions of media and communication in the contemporary world, as well as examining the changing nature of power and the process of power diffusion in an information age. In doing so, this course will discuss the evolution of the transnational communication, the phenomenon of “electronic colonialism”, and the debate of New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) etc.\n\nThis is an interdisciplinary course, which covers the essential theories and concepts ranging from political science, international relations, media studies and communication. The first session of this course will first introduce the new trend of globalization, in particular, the emergence of broadcasting news agency and social media. The second part of this course will then critically assess the impact of the new way of world communication on international affairs and domestic events.",

However, in this globalization era, people often have many cultural lenses. Through understanding the impact of globalization on cultures and societies, we will have nuanced understanding of how people from different cultures construct reality. Many scholars and activists argue that globalization will lead to a worldwide homogenized consumer culture dominated by Western values. Others believe that globalization can lead to the clashes of incorrigible cultures. Meanwhile, globalization has catalyzed formation of new hybrid cultures and fostered the blooming of creative cultural industries. In this course, we will explore the above topics through understanding the effects of globalization on personal identities, the economy, consumerism, and communication, etc. in the immediate and distal environment.",

It aims to offer students with the basic knowledge and analytical tools for making sense of current issues in global politics. It adopts a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates theoretical issues with regional case studies.\n\nThe course will first offer a general survey of the key concepts and major theoretical perspectives in the study of Global Politics (Liberalism, Realism, Social Constructivism and Marxist theory, etc.). It then proceeds to cover selected topics of global politics in the areas of War and Peace and the Clash of Civilization. It focuses on how world politics is transformed by globalization, with a particular focus on its impacts on issues concerning the identity and national pride, balance of power, peace and conflicts, borders and security, etc. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of latest trends of global governance, with a particular focus on the emergency of international and regional organizations. Relevant real world examples and case studies will be adopted to illustrate the big ideas and key concepts of global politics.\n\nThis course intends to promote students’ appreciation of the role of ‘power’, ‘security’ and ‘justice’ in shaping the global political order nowadays. Students will gain deeper insights into not only latest developments in global political affairs, but also concepts and theories useful for further studies in politics, international relations, and global political economy. The course is designed to introduce essential concepts, major theoretical perspectives and basic mechanisms of global political order, allowing students to communicate issues in world politics effectively in group work and individually, in oral as well as written forms.",

      "description": "(UGEC2354 is double-coded with GLSD2401.)\nThe course introduces the concept of human carrying capacity in the globe. The capacity symbolizes the balance between population size and environmental resources ––the underlying foundation for sustainable development. In history, it is shown that the human carrying capacity was periodically shrunk by climate deterioration and human-induced environmental degradation, resulting in catastrophic social consequences such as mass migrations, wars, or even population collapses. In this course, the background knowledge of climate-induced and human-induced environmental change will be introduced. The associated physical and social dimensions of environmental change will also be covered. Based on the lessons of the past, together with recent trends in global climate change and social development, the human carrying capacity in contemporary societies will be systematically examined. Some controversial issues related to human-environment nexus will also be discussed. This is a course of general appeal to students with different backgrounds.",

      "description": "(UGEC2353 is double-coded with GLSD2501.)\n\nThis course aims to provide students the foundational knowledge on the operation of world economy and examine how social, political and institutional factors contribute to the creation of global economic order. It examines the intertwining and interaction of economics (wealth creation) and politics (political power) in global affairs.\n\nThe course will first offer a general survey of the key concepts and major theoretical perspectives in the study of Global Political Economy (GPE) (Liberalism, Mercantilism, and Marxist theory, etc.). In the second part, we cover substantive policy issues including international trade and monetary system, foreign investment and multi-national corporations, etc.. It focuses on how the world economy is transformed by globalization, with a particular focus on the development of various international and regional institutions that govern the current economic order. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of latest trends of global economic governance, with a particular focus on the transforming role of national states and the endeavors of international development on poverty and inequality reduction. Relevant country experiences will be adopted to illustrate the dynamics of economic growth and stability.\n\nGLSD2501 intends to promote students’ appreciation of the role of institutions and politics in the operation of global economic order. Students are not required to have any background in the discipline for the course is designed to introduce essential concepts, major theoretical perspectives and basic operations of modern world economy, allowing students to communicate issues in world economic order effectively in group work and individually, in oral as well as written forms.",

They examine almost all of the general ideas covered in the lectures and thereby are widely adopted by tertiary institutions as teaching textbooks. However, a notable limitation of them is that they draw most examples from America and Europe when explaining those concepts and thus the students who are not familiar with American and European political economy may be frustrated by their description. To balance this, the instructor will provide Asian examples in the lecture materials."

Besides being individuals, they are also products of their culture—their psychological processes (i.e., thoughts, feelings, behavior, identities, beliefs, and assumptions) are shaped by their cultural backgrounds and experiences. In this course, we learn about how cultures influence and shape individuals’ psychological processes, what happens when individuals from different cultures meet one another (resulting from globalization), and when cultures meet one another within individuals (resulting in multiculturalism).\n\nThe course will focus on timely, essential and at times sensitive and controversial topics central to the psychology of globalization, such as colonialism and how it shaped our psychological understanding of ourselves and others; how racism and stereotyping are psychological phenomena that interfere with successful globalization today; or how different moral cultures understand and often conflict with each other.\n\nThis course adopts an introductory approach to cultural psychology and focuses on how our individual psychology interacts with an increasingly globalized world. The first part of the course will introduce students to fundamental concepts and findings in the field of cultural psychology. The second part of this course will explore the relevance of this body of knowledge in a time of rapid globalization, one of the most important developments in the twenty-first century.",

This course will particularly explore a number of theoretical debates in IR literature, and the practice of IL in different political arena, for instances, trading relationship, multinational cooperation and territorial administration. This course will also cover the historical evolution of the international system after the Second World War and the transformation of the IL. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of latest development of IR. Relevant real-world examples and case studies will be adopted to illustrate the big ideas and key concepts of IL and politics. This course intends to offer students a more comprehensive idea of IR and IL. This course prepares students a deeper insight into not only on study of global politics and IL, and but also provide a farsighted idea of todays’ issues and to meet future challenges. The course is designed to introduce essential concepts, major theoretical perspectives and basic mechanisms of IR and IL, allowing students to communicate issues in world politics effectively in group work and individually, in oral as well as written forms.",

The societal impacts of environmental problems are also discussed. It aims to offer students with basic knowledge and analytical tools for making sense of how global environmental issues are shaped by world politics and international policies. It adopts a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates theoretical issues with empirical case studies.\n\nThe course will first offer a general introduction of current global environmental challenges such as climate change and deforestation. After providing a brief historical advancement of addressing trans-boundary environmental problems, it proceeds to examine how different actors respond to the problems. Also, the roles played by different actors in global environment governance on selected topics are discussed. It focuses not only on how the responses of different actors towards global environmental crisis are driven by world politics, but also the tight connection between global political-economy and physical environment, including how socio-economic factors contribute to, and also being affected by, global environmental problems. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of the latest trends and future of global environmental governance, particularly the recent dynamics of international and regional organizations. Relevant real world examples and case studies will be presented to illustrate the big ideas and key concepts of global environmental politics.",

However, in case of special circumstances, students may also choose the ‘distributed mode’ (i.e. several hours in a week over a number of weeks equaling 320 hours). GLSD Programme will deploy work units, agencies, or organizations that provide internships relevant to the general course objectives. Meanwhile, students are encouraged to explore opportunities of internship to fit their own specific learning needs. However, all self-selected internship must comply with the course requirements, and subjected to the approval of GLSD Programme Director. Guidance and assistance will be provided whenever appropriate.\n\nDuring the internship, each student would be guided and assisted by an academic supervisor. The supervisor offers advice and help whenever necessary during the attachment period. At the same time, each student will be receiving guidance and assistance from his/her agency supervisor. Students will construct and submit a portfolio to reflect on the experience in the internship. Academic advice will be provided to help students consolidate their learning in the internship.",
