It requires students to undertake project work with a view to make concrete their understanding of the underlying technologies enabling Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure. The student projects will be required to explore the implications of new financial services technology, in particular, the licensing prerequisites, regulatory controls and supervision such new services necessitate. Students will have to form groups and select a particular infrastructure area, e.g. electronic payments or lending, and conduct a deep analysis of its operations, and thereby creating new/enhanced service propositions. It is intended that project teams will be able to create prototype solutions through collaborating with, for example, the Hong Kong and Science Technology Park (HKSTP), Cyberport, ASTRI, or other CUHK labs. Upon completing this course, students should have acquired advanced understanding of components of financial infrastructure, and its significance in the financial services sector.",

      "description": "Intelligent Automation (IA) is software-based automation which executes business processes on behalf of knowledge workers with minimal human intervention. IA combines methods and various technologies, in particular, robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence. As the core and foundational technology of intelligent automation (IA), robotic process automation (RPA) has been described as a first step on the stairway of intelligent automation towards building digital workers. The aim of this course is to provide learners comprehensive coverage of intelligent automation – including RPA development skills and AI fundamentals– in the context of financial services. This course will build the capabilities of students to an advanced level and will enable participants to actively engage in the full lifecycle of “bot” development from assessment of automation opportunities through the building/deployment of functional automations. The course also introduces students to the latest industry developments in low-code artificial intelligence providing students with less technical backgrounds an opportunity to learn the skills to automate business processes without a need of a computer science background.Course participants are expected to:1. Gain a clear understanding of the intelligent automation (RPA + AI) industry and benefits and understand the limits and constraints of process automation.2. Learn about the role of business analysis in the context of process automation implementation including: (a) how to conduct an automation opportunity assessment; (b) how to map the requirements and deliverables of a process automation project; (c) best practices during the Process Deep Dive stage including ways of compiling comprehensive process-related documentation; (d) testing strategies for an process automation solution; (e) how to conduct trainings and create a User Manual during Go-Live preparations; and (f) how to manage changes throughout the entire process automation development process. 3. Understand the delivery methodology of process automation project/program management including: (a) steps of a process automation implementation, (b) choosing processes suitable for automation, (c) driving/managing process automation projects, and (d) raising intelligent automation awareness throughout an organization.4. Obtain a solid grasp of the technical skills required to create software robots. 5. Be able to build and deploy software robots to automate a variety of manual tasks/process encountered in financial operations.",

Students will learn about decentralized systems, distributed consensus, blockchains, smart contracts, and the contrast between DeFi and traditional finance. The course starts with a brief review of the notion of money, conventional banking and payment systems. It then proceeds to cover different DeFi assets including cryptocurrencies, tokens and stablecoins. Various DeFi infrastructure technologies such as Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), Automated Market Maker (AMM) protocols, Decentralized Lending/ Borrowing protocols, and Oracles are also discussed. The course concludes with decentralized governance, DeFi risk management and best practices for DeFi security. By exploring the intricacies of DeFi ecosystems, students will gain a better understanding of the opportunities, challenges, and systemic risks associated with this emerging field.",

Agentic AI goes beyond traditional AI by incorporating a \"chaining\" capability: it can take a “sequence” of actions in response to a single request, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps or coordinating among multiple agents to achieve a common goal. Agentic AI systems have a high degree of autonomy and can act with minimal human supervision. Agentic AI could revolutionize business and financial technologies of the future. This course introduces the students to the fundamentals of agentic systems, covering reinforcement learning agents, language model agents, and multi-agent systems.

Students will participate in a week-long field-trip (e.g. in Silicon Valley, Crypto Valley or Singapore, etc.), to visit organisations on various FinTech domains for a close-up on the operation. Course learning activities include lectures/ seminars at universities/ companies, discussions with management of start-up companies, and site visits to enterprises, etc. Through these activities, students will be able to learn practical operational knowledge and experience from FinTech entrepreneurs in close distance.Student should take part in a class group project, to present the research findings on FinTech entrepreneurship and the learning outcomes of the field trip",

Unless otherwise approved by the Professor-in-Charge, the project should involve an industrial partner with a co-supervisor from the industry. At the end of the course, the student must give a presentation to the academic and industry supervisors, and submit a report detailing the findings and deliverables. The student’s grade will be determined by the presentation and the report.Unless otherwise approved by the Programme Director, the credits for Financial Technology Project I are recognized if and only if the student takes also Financial Technology Project II in a subsequent semester.If a student has prior industrial background and has already secured a project topic with an industrial practitioner and the agreement of an academic staff, Financial Technology Project I can be taken in the first semester of studies. Otherwise, the two project courses can be taken in any consecutive semesters, including the summer term.Students are encouraged to find industrial projects by themselves and talk to various academic staffs for project ideas before enrolling in the courses.",

Unless otherwise approved by the Professor-in-Charge, the project should involve an industrial partner with a co-supervisor from the industry. At the end of the course, the student must give a presentation to the academic and industry supervisors, and submit a report detailing the findings and deliverables. The student’s grade will be determined by the presentation and the report.Unless otherwise approved by the Programme Director, the credits for Financial Technology Project I are recognized if and only if the student takes also Financial Technology Project II in a subsequent semester.If a student has prior industrial background and has already secured a project topic with an industrial practitioner and the agreement of an academic staff, Financial Technology Project I can be taken in the first semester of studies. Otherwise, the two project courses can be taken in any consecutive semesters, including the summer term.Students are encouraged to find industrial projects by themselves and talk to various academic staffs for project ideas before enrolling in the courses.",
