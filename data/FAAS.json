Emphasis will be placed on three major aspects: 1) the perception of form and space; 2) materials and construction; and 3) 3D form as artistic expression. The course will also help students to get familiar with studio operations that would equip them for further sculptural practice.",

Transformation of Form & Space\n\nExplore various ways of form-space-transformation that lead to ideas/concepts of 3D artistic expression.\n\n3. From 2D Plane to 3D Form\n\nPattern cutting as a means of analyzing, de-constructing and re-constructing a 3D form.\n\n4. 3D Construction - from Handicraft to Digital Forming and vice-versa\n\nInvestigate wide range of possibilities to further develop a hand-built sculptural form within a digital environment. Usage of 3D scanner and printer will be introduced and practiced. The final piece should be a combination of hand-crafted and digital forming.\n\n5. The Container & the Contained\n\nA tailor-made container / box will be constructed to house the sculptural form developed in the previous stages. Relevant images as well as different materials / textures will be explored and eventually applied onto the container / box to further reference the conceptual development of the sculptural form. Usage of appropriate tools and machinery will be introduced and practiced.",

      "description": "(UGED2316 is double-coded with FAAS2100.)\n\nIn the traditional discourse of Chinese painting, it was believed that an artist should “外師造化，中得心源” (outwardly learn from the Nature and inwardly trace the source of their own heart). Unfortunately, with the enormous temporal and geographical difference, both the Nature and the “heart-source” of the ancient masters, as well as their techniques in articulating the two, appear to be unapproachable to us living in the modern age. Likewise, the field’s ambiguous meta-language full of expressions like “氣韻生動” (infusing ch’i to show life movement) or “意趣” (subtle charm resulted from spontaneity) can also be a hurdle to uninitiated students.\n\nDistant it might seem, art, after all, is inspired by real life. This course seeks to explore the material basis of the Nature artistically heightened by the ancient artists directed by their “heart-source”. We would try to explore the abstract philosophical ideas and aesthetic ideals by looking at something physical and concrete: by visiting specific scenic sites, we would be able to compare the landscape with the paintings they inspired and have more idea on how the visual vocabulary and grammar of Chinese painting “translates” the real world; and by viewing the objects, or even experience some of the activities central to the artists’ cultural life, students would also have a more substantial understanding on the “heart-source” of these painters.\n\nThis course would use the Songjiang and Wu Schools of painting as case studies. A field trip will be organized and students will be walked through the areas of Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou where the Ming Dynasty painters were active in. Through the well-preserved tangible heritage of the region, students could have a better feeling of the intangible ideational world of the ancient masters and their artistic pursuits. The endeavours of the local communities in preserving these invaluable treasures will also be reviewed.",

      "description": "(UGEC2371 is double-coded with FAAS2118.)\nContemporary art is diverse and expansive, and its timeline, topics, and aesthetic strategies, are continually redefined. This course offers an introduction into political and aesthetic issues addressed in global contemporary art, particularly since 1989 which marked the fall of the Iron Curtain and the first primordial “global” exhibition at Centre Pompidou. It will provide a variety of perspectives to discuss visions of the future presented by artists from diverse cultural backgrounds, who engage with such global issues as migration, borders, postcolonial conflicts, gender perspectives, environmental crisis, biodiversity, and digital capitalism. It will provide students with foundational knowledge on the emergence, developments, and challenges of global contemporary art discourses, as well as their contesting relationship with artistic autonomy and the society. We will examine a range of topics and methods employed by influential artists and thinkers in various geographies. This will provide a toolkit for understanding and curating contemporary art. To put critical thinking into practice, we will integrate exercises such as screenings and discussions, group projects, and exhibition proposals. Beyond art historical perspectives, we will also delve into questions regarding humans’ relationship with each other and the nonhumans, which are fundamental for understanding global currents and crisis addressed in contemporary art.",

Identify major global art trends and key influential artworks from Europe, the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Africa since 1989.\n2. Examine the origins of and developments of the concept of global contemporary art in relation to postcolonial and posthuman discourses.\n3. Recognize, differentiate, and explain the transcultural and transregional topics and issues that contemporary artists and curators engage in their works in the larger geopolitical contexts.\n4. Build informed opinions on the quality and relevance of the arts since 1989, paying attention to their relations with global and local political and historical events.\n5. Develop skills in speaking in public and organize research materials.",
      "course_syllabus": "1. **Introduction: Autonomy**\n\nIn this introduction session, we will cover some fundamental ideas and debates of global contemporary art, including the issues of autonomy, timeline, and social engagements, referencing theories and curatorial practices since 1989. Drawing from selected international museum collections, we will unpack a variety of institutional and geopolitical contexts that contributed to the formation of global contemporary art.\n\n1. **Feminism**\n\nThis session will be devoted to feminist criticisms in art history, specifically the dialogues between women’s art and feminist movements between the 1970s and post 2000s. We will draw from several group exhibitions in Asia and the Americas post-1989 to discuss the issues of essentialism and representation in feminist Art histories.\n\n1. **Queerness**\n\nThis session introduces various artistic approaches in deconstructing queer identities and bodies, mainly through selected case studies in digital and performance art. Students will be encouraged to compare these with discourses introduced during the last session, and discuss ways of decentering and expanding conventional feminist discourses.\n\n1. **Migration**\n\nIn this session, we will examine the concepts of mapping and displacements in the context of specific political and environmental crises. To do so, selections of contemporary gallery films by minority or immigrant artists will be screened, followed by a discussion.\n\n1. **Transculturality and Border Art**\n\nDrawing from transcultural studies and border studies, we will examine several media and performance art works as well as curatorial approaches that cope with cultural conflicts and hybridity. Selected case studies include *Magiciens de la terre* in Paris in 1989, the Whitney Biennale in New York, Asian Biennale in Taichung, and documenta Kassel.\n\n1. **Colonialism**\n\nThis session focuses on visual art creations that address natural resource extraction and indigenous rights issues. It will start with an introduction to primitivism in modern art, then move on to reactions to Imperialism in works by South-East Asian and African artists as new nation states and identities emerge.\n\n1. **Indigenous Art and Postcolonialism**\n\nWe will talk about First Nations land justice and reconciliation in this session. An institutional history of indigenous art will be covered first, then selected contemporary practices and their cultural representations under specific government policies. Particular attention will be given to discourses in Canada, Australia, and the New Zealand.\n\n1. **Environmentalism**\n\nThis session introduces discourses of eco-art and the Anthropocene. We will also draw from political ecology to discuss artistic approaches to environmental justice. Issues of community engagement and green washing will be attended.\n\n1. **Bio Art**\n\nThis session provides an overview on the history of bio art, its application in industries, the public reception, and the ethical issues.\n\n1. **Digital Capitalism**\n\nIn this session, we will look at artistic reflections on surveillance and digital capitalism through concrete examples. We will screen selected essay films that engages with data discrimination, surveillance infrastructure, and deepfake, followed by a discussion.\n\n1. **Asian Diaspora**\n\nIn this session, we will discuss the definitions of diaspora and the Sinophone through visual arts. We will look at artists outside of Mainland China who engage with “Chinese” identities differently. Works by such artists as Ian Cheng, Patty Chang, Musquiqui Chihying, and Lee Wen will be discussed.",

These skills in isolation are however not sufficient to create original comics and this art form can only exist through the proper arrangement of visual elements and image-text interactions. This course aims to provide students with the necessary understanding to further develop their understanding of visual and narrative communication through the creation of a story in the form of comics. In order to enhance students’ capacity to create such an interaction of narrative and images, workshops in the assisted creation of stories will be provided alongside the development of the student’s own visual research. Students will also be encouraged to find their own visual language and graphic style.\nComic writing is a demanding profession that requires a number of specialized skills. This course will offer training and tutorials in the skills most appropriate to comics creation such as character design, script writing and the kind of sensitive observation that leads to intelligent creativity. Other specialized skills, such as insights into the marketing of comics and management of high-pressure schedules, will also be presented to students; this course will prepare potential comics creators for any future challenge in the profession.",

It delves into the dialectic relations between history, archive, and art. Furthermore, we will explore immersive narratives as a means to showcase contemporary art practices, using archives to investigate the present and envision the future.\nThe course begins with an analysis of seminal theoretical texts and case studies in archival art practices. We will then delve into the fundamental concepts of data analytics, exploring how algorithms and big data have transformed our methods of acquiring knowledge. Students will critically assess the approaches and challenges of artists’ archival practices and data analytics tools through theoretical discussions and case studies of various artworks. These discussions will emphasize how artists engage with data or inventories to interpret and think. Students will complete a creative project to synthesize their learning.",

Introduction: Archival Art Practice in Digital Age**\n\nIn this introductory session, we will cover fundamental ideas and debates surrounding archival art practice in contemporary art. How do the digital aspects that challenge traditional archival history reshape our understanding of archival art practice? To what extent can these challenges be leveraged as opportunities for art practice using digitally enhanced tools within Digital Humanities?\n\nThis class will also introduce the course structure, reading materials, teaching methods, timetable, and assignments.\n\n* *2. The Archival Impulse and Contemporary Contingencies**\n\nThis class will explore the powerful impulse to archive in contemporary culture and its significance in historical knowledge and remembrance. It will also examine the evolving attitudes toward archives in modern and postmodern art, focusing on how artists engage with archival practices and create counter-archives.\n\n* *3. Memory, Forgetting, and Re-presentation in Archival Art**\n\nThis class will investigate the role of memory and forgetting in archival art. It will discuss how traces in documents and archives serve as testimony to past events and how artists use these traces to create new narratives. The concept of “détournement” in collage and the practice of collecting will also be explored.\n\n* *4. The Digital Archive and Ephemeral Art**\n\nThis class will examine the impact of digital technologies on archival practices, focusing on the transition from physical to digital archives. It will discuss the fluid and dynamic nature of digital archives and their potential for new memory cultures. The class will also explore the ephemeral nature of contemporary archival art and its implications for preservation and memory.\n\n* *5 What is Data Science?**\nThis class will cover the fundamental concepts of data science and the latest developments in AI for text analysis, particularly in the context of big data. We will also consider the impact of data on archival practices. Additionally, we will discuss the features and limitations of data mining in cultural analytics.\n\n* *6. Data Science Tools**\n\nExplore the tools of data science that relate to archival art and the ethical considerations of using AI tools. Discuss the concept of algorithms in text analysis, focusing on the open-source data mining software, which uses a set of rules or procedures to perform various data analysis tasks. Examine the impact of digital technologies on text analysis and data visualization.\n\n* *7. Workshops on Digital Preservation**\n\nIn this class, students will be introduced to the fundamental technologies of virtuality, under the category of Extended Reality (XR) and 3D scanning. We will discuss the unique characteristics of computational media, distinguishing it from other forms of media. And its application on digital preservation.\n\n* *8. Workshops on Virtual Reality**\n\nThis workshop will teach students the basic use of software and hardware tools to create virtual immersive narratives.

      "description": "Art in pubic space became an important subject for those who wanted to reconcile the conflict between individual artistic ideas and the common norms in public space in 21st century. The presumption that artist cannot contribute significantly to public sector is questionable nowadays—there are many experiments being done to show that artistic intervention can somehow arouse the awareness of hidden power and political structure of the society. As a citizen or an artist, art has a role to play in public space.\nSeeing public space as an arena for artistic expression becomes another focus in contemporary art. Gallery, museum which are supposed to be neutral space in showing art is gradually replaced by space with cultural significances; message in art has been put into specific context for holistic examination.\nThe course will cover various art forms in public space, which include traditionally defined public art, such as sculpture and functional objects in public space. The course will also teach student how to realize an art project through management and negotiation among different stakeholders— the client, the public, the technical consultant and the artist.",

Although the emphasis of this course will be on the arts of the 17th and 18th centuries, many of the problems raised during this comparative analysis will lead to an exploration of some issues concerning contemporary art in China and the rest of the world.",

      "description": "Even a cursory knowledge of Euro-American contemporary art will lead to the realization that one needs to know the writings to understand the visual. If the present situation seems to have made the existence of theory in texts necessary, art theory has however existed for a very long time and in many different forms. To better understand the often very complex thinking that accompanies present-day art practices, it is necessary to understand the history of the thought attached to art. This course specializes in the thinking about art made in Europe and North America from the Antiquity to the present. Three kinds of texts will therefore be used: the writings produced by philosophers about aesthetics and art; the art theory and art criticism written in the public sphere; as well as the writings made by artists on their own practices.",
