      "description": "Firms/organizations are faced with increasingly complex environments today. On the one hand, they have legal responsibility that their profits should be gained within the confines of law. On the other hand, firms/organizations have broader responsibilities for stakeholders other than shareholders. In spite of the traditional paradigms debating whether businesses should implement corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities to the society or not, it is now argued that firms with strategic CSR activities would enable them to formulate better business strategies and decisions, thus enhancing competitiveness and firm performance. Firms of different nature, such as social enterprises, can also contribute to the society with both economic and social values. Thus, students have to extend their understanding of business and its environments using modern concepts of CSR.\n\nHalf of this course provides an examination of the legal environment of Hong Kong that encompasses a selection of topics in relation to business laws. Another half of the course introduces theories and concepts of CSR as well as business and professional ethics.",

The ability to connect horizontally is “design thinking”, which is the bridge between creativity and innovation, combining divergent and convergent modes of thinking to connect user-experience, technology and business models to create values.\nIndividuals equipped with “design thinking”, the ability to think as a designer, will be able to innovate, tackle complex problems and manage changes in real life situations. By acquiring a designer’s perspective in looking at the world, students can learn to appreciate what it means to “think out of a box” --- the thinking style that transcends traditional management control mindset. They can create more alternatives before they exercise their disciplines to decide on and implement those alternatives. This course is for students who not only know how to solve problems but know what problems to solve.",

Another crucial trend in management today is that organizations need to know more about the micro-foundations, that is, behavioral and psychological principles and mechanisms, behind their business. These are consistent with the notion that a, if not the, key to business success is through knowing about people (e.g., customers, managers, and employees). This course is accordingly designed as a selective survey of micro organizational behavior/human resource management and particularly the applications in the Chinese context in order to promote a deep understanding of the micro-foundation of responsible business in the Chinese context. Topics include: understanding people in China (e.g., individual differences, leadership, and motivation), understanding work in China (e.g., job design and teams), and understanding well-being in China.",

A business model is a logical and internally consistent representation of the design and operations of a business, capturing the essence of how it will be focused and demonstrating how an interrelated set of decision variables will be addressed to create, deliver and capture value. There is a widespread recognition that competition between businesses today is not solely based on their strategies but to a large extent on innovative business models. Increasingly often, startups introduce new business models and change the dynamics of the industry and related industries. Business model innovation is focused on the design and development of new and unique business models that, by definition, challenge accepted conventions in a given industry about how to create and deliver customer value in new ways. This course will explore the range and diversity of innovative business models in the digital economy and equip students with hands on experience in developing innovative business models that capitalizes strategic opportunities given by the digitalization.",

The difficulties that these complex behaviors pose for prediction, adaptation, monitoring and management are profound, and have received extensive attention under the rubrics of “resilience,” “vulnerability,” and “tipping points.” The course covers how institutions and culture shape human interactions with one another and the environment. Students will learn institutional challenges for sustainable development posed by the need to create or protect public goods (e.g. environmental services, “green” technologies) in the face of multiple externalities and opportunities for free-riding.\n\nThis course goes beyond theoretical concepts. Business and corporations play critical roles in driving sustainability. Understanding sustainability and drive sustainable business development is a “must” for future business success and is a transformational process requiring strategic insights, leadership and commitment. Students will acquire practical tools and strategies for driving sustainable transformation that have been proven to foster a sustainable future for businesses. In addition, students will also learn the best practices from successful leading companies locally and globally to build up practitioner skills in driving sustainable changes in the industry.",

The more common alternatives are: (a) Selection of a topic not normally covered in our curriculum in which the student has an interest. Normally the student would prepare a literature review on the selected topic. It would then be common for the student to perform some application or extension of this body of knowledge by extending or substantiating that knowledge by some data collection. (b) Preparation of a case and accompanying teacher's note. The case must be based on real organisations and substantial data collection would be expected.

These businesses are ridiculed, especially in Hong Kong, as unprofessional and cronyism-driven. But one cannot ignore their importance: families started many of the most successful firms in the world; families owned the majority of listed firms; many family firms uphold the best innovation, quality and brand value; and family funds constitute some largest philanthropic and investment projects. This course takes a family enterprising approach to discuss the importance, diversity, complexity, and more importantly continuous entrepreneurship of business family (as opposed to family business). Apart from lectures and case analysis, students should interact with family members and associated professionals to understand the types, life cycle, conflict, succession, characteristics of business families. For sustaining their growth, practical approaches, such as structures and procedures as advisory boards, family councils, family venture funds and spin-offs, and family philanthropy, will also be discussed. This course shall benefit family business members, managers in family-owned firms, and professionals.",

The course complements the Business Practicum elective in which students have the opportunity to apply consulting skills in a real consulting engagement with a local company. In a typical session, the first hour will be an overview lecture on the Topic, or a discussion of the assigned Readings. A short 'Industry interlude' will cover aspects of the history and structure of the management consulting industry, including ethics, professional qualifications and recruitment practices. The final ninety minutes will be spent on an assigned \"caselet\" (a short-form case) based on a real management consulting engagement. Caselets will cover commercial organizations in China and overseas, as well as consulting interventions in not-for-profits and the Public Sector. Students will be placed into groups and each group will be asked to practice specific consulting skills and roles, with opportunities for each student to plan a consulting engagement, facilitate discussions with clients, and lead a consulting team.",

      "description": "Both organizations and society are becoming increasingly global as developments in technology, media, and politics have made the world “smaller” and increasingly interdependent. While in the past the international arena has been limited to large multinational corporations and even some large companies have only been active in their local market, today increasingly many companies, both small and large, engage in business which transcends geographic, political, and cultural boundaries. Thus, for most firms international business is no longer an option it is a must.\n\nDifferences between countries such as cultural differences and institutional differences have important implications for the optimal way to conduct business in a country. Although the world is becoming more global, today more than ever people have an expectation that foreigners doing business in their country have an understanding of what management practices are normally used locally, and organizational behavior is still strongly influenced by people’s cultural background. To be successful in this global economy, a manager must understand the effect diverse cultures have on how organizations work and be capable of managing multiple cultures interacting—two skills this course will seek to develop. The course is highly interactive using case studies and simulations as well as interactive lectures and discussions to facilitate learning.\n\nThis course will help prepare people planning to work in large and small firms alike to be senior executives making important international business decisions and acting as an effective international manager. Most managers agree that international business is not easy. Thus, we will learn strategies to make the internationalization process easier, and we will develop an understanding of the different modes of entry which are at our disposal and when different modes are preferable. This course will also study mergers and acquisitions which are becoming increasingly important in our world today. The course will explore key strategies for international business and also investigate how to interact with people from different countries most effectively, how to work on multicultural teams effectively, how to be an effective leader in different countries, and how to conduct international negotiations. We will also study how to deal with complexity and deal with multiple tasks at the same time which is an important challenge that international managers face. The course will also explore key design, management, and strategy issues multinational companies face. While this course will focus on international business broadly, for part of the course we will take a deep dive into how to do business in mainland China as an example of international business. Thus, we will explore how to effectively enter and operate in China, how to negotiate effectively with Chinese, which strategies and management practices work best in China, how to be effective leader in China, etc.",

      "description": "The aim of this course is to provide a solid grounding for students interested in top management and (to a lesser extent) government policy issues concerning the innovation process within organizations. The course is divided into several main parts. The first part discusses technology at the macro level: its impact on industries and nations, and patterns of technological change. The second part focuses on disruptive innovations – what they are, how they affect firms and industry change, and how they facilitate entrepreneurship. The third part deals with the response of firms to disruptive innovations, including the changing basis of competition in markets. The increasing returns environment is also examined. The fourth part focuses on building the internal capabilities of organizations to innovate, and discusses the innovator's solution. The fifth part discusses additional topics in innovation such as entrepreneurship and spurring innovation at the societal level. Case studies, both written and video-based, are used extensively to illustrate a range of technologies and the problems associated with developing them and bringing them to market. The course spends much time examining new technologies, how to think strategically about them, how to develop them and how firms should pursue them (or why they fail to pursue these new technologies).",

      "description": "Theories will stay on paper forever if they are not applied in practice. To become a successful business leader in the future, you need to master the skills of effective communication and be able to communicate with impact. Contrary to popular myth, there is no natural outstanding presenter or inborn good communicator. This course will help you acquire the necessary skills of a great communicator and break your psychological barrier when you need to present in front of a large audience.\n\nUnlike the other presentation workshops, we are not training for elocutionists. In this course, you will learn how to master the golden rules of communication in the real world and how to adopt a target audience based impactful dialogue to achieve your goal with long-term sustainable business impact. These audience groups may include investors, bosses, business partners and other business stakeholders.\n\nDelivering an eloquent presentation in a story-telling way is only the first step. This course will also enhance your probing skills of obtaining useful information from business stakeholders, winning the pitches, handling objections and coping with Q&As. More importantly, you will learn how to close a deal at the end of the communication/presentation based on experiential learning and introduction of various effective and relevant models deduced from real working and business situations.\n\nThe course will also introduce escalator pitch which has become popular and is a critical skill nowadays. When successfully deployed, it will improve your bargaining power and the chance of winning. Lecturers will share with you their personal experience using real cases from MNCs such as Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Nestle, PepsiCo, Johnson & Johnson and Dyson.",
