This course is to study the development of Humanistic Buddhism, including its history, thoughts, and practices. It is divided into three closely related parts. We will first investigate the basic doctrines of traditional Buddhism in relation to the arising of humanistic Buddhism. We then examine the history of humanistic Buddhism in the early Republic era (1912-1949). The social, political, religious, as well as economic background in which Humanistic Buddhism arose will be discussed with an emphasis on the interaction between Buddhist institutions and society. The teaching and practice of some pioneers of Humanistic Buddhism, such as Ven. Taixu will be studied. Finally, we will explore the contemporary developments of humanistic Buddhism in general, and Foguan Shan Buddhism in particular.",

      "description": "The renowned Dunhuangologist Ji Xianlin (1911-2009) once pointed out: “There are only four cultural systems in the world which have been recognized as having a long history, a vast geographical span, a selfcontained cultural system as well as far-reaching impacts – China, India, Greece and Islam; the fifth one does not exist. There is only one place where all four of these cultural systems converge – the region of Dunhuang and Xinjiang in China, and no more.”The murals and statues in Dunhuang Grottoes are well preserved through different dynasties, and have aesthetic style sourced from different cultures. Dunhuang is very rich in many aspects, namely: art and culture, history and archaeology. However, the most precious out of so many valuable cultural relics is the Buddhist iconography and with the Buddhist teaching and philosophy within. This course is specially designed to offer an inspiring and in-depth introduction of Buddhist teaching and philosophy through Dunhuang Buddhist iconography. The historical and cultural background, the related aesthetic and archaeology aspects will also be introduced.Its coverage includes areas such as the essence of the teaching in Buddhism: Dependent Origination, Cause & Effect, the Noble Eightfold Path (Middle Path), the idea of ‘non-self’, karma theory, nirvāna etc.; the Concept of Pure Land, the cult of Guanyin and Maitreya in China, and also the history of the spread and inheritance of Buddhist iconography from 4th to 14th centuries in China.The course is intended for individuals who are interested in the Buddhist studies and want to study Buddhism and its practice as a means for spiritual development in a comprehensive way. It is also for participants who interested to study Buddhist teachings through Dunhuang Buddhist iconography and adding a new dimension to their spirituality and apply the Buddhist teaching into their daily lives, move along from suffering towards sustainable happiness.",

Longstanding Buddhist scriptural traditions have existed in diverse languages across Asia for over two thousand years, and Buddhist concepts are notoriously difficult to translate. English has emerged as the key, common language for the translating Buddhist writings and for conducting scholarship on Buddhism worldwide.  This course is intended for students, fluent in Chinese and with a background in Buddhist Studies, who want to improve their abilities to read English-language scholarship and translations. The course is also intended for anyone, including those whose English is already strong, who wants an introduction to how Buddhism is studied in Western scholarship. In this course, students will practice reading about Buddhism in English, will learn about scholarly conventions for translating Buddhist terms, and will become proficient in pronouncing and composing Indic Buddhist technical terms in Romanized script.  This course will be integrated with the English Language Teaching Unit’s (ELTU) English Across the Curriculum (EAC) program, which will provide assistance to students in their English-language learning needs.",

We will examine in-depth four key moments of paradigm shift in Chinese religious culture, in the Warring States Period (481-256 BC) before the arrival of Buddhism, the Period of Division (220-589 AD), the Song-Yuan (960-1368), and modern China (1850-present). One focus of the course is to investigate how Buddhism interacted with local religious culture in China through a variety of confluences and conflicts in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems. We will review foundational debates from the 20th century, such as ‘Buddhist conquest of China’ and ‘Chinese transformation of Buddhism’ or the ‘Sinification of Buddhism.’",

      "description": "Meditation is considered by many to be the hallmark practice of Buddhism, yet when we talk about meditation, we often assume a meditation practice in the singular and neglect the internal diversity. This course will explore the complexity of the meditation tradition in the plural to enable students to have a holistic view of Buddhist practice in the broad context of the Buddhist world. The course is designed to provide a balanced presentation of Buddhist meditation traditions, from early Pali and Sanskrit scriptures to developments such as Chan and Tantric Buddhism. It will look closely at what happens in meditative states, how Buddhist contemplative traditions have changed, and what elements we can say are common to virtually all periods and places in Buddhist history. All readings will be provided in English translation, except for those in classic Chinese.",
