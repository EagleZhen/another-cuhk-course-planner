      "description": "(UGEC1209 is double-coded with GDRS1001.)  This course aims to develop students’ ability to analyze the everyday life through the lens of gender. Drawing on the interdisciplinary nature of Women’s and Gender Studies, the course will guide students to examine how gender works as one of the primary social organizing principles in the movies we watch, the housework we do, the behaviors we express and many other daily activities that have been routinized. The first three lectures will equip students with a critical gender lens by questioning biology and getting familiar with theories of gender role, socialization, gender schema, doing gender and queer theory. All concepts to be explored in class will be explained with reference to research. At the end of the course, students will come to understand how political their personal life is. In particular, the course hopes to inspire students to take part in creating social change for gender equality, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",

      "description": "The qualitative research methods are an essential skill in the contemporary world and are widely used in gender studies. Having the gender lens in qualitative research lends itself greater importance as it helps to uncover the mechanism and the intersectional social forces giving shape to forms of inequalities, identities, and communities. As AI and big data are the buzz words today to restructure the future work force, qualitative research skills are becoming increasingly important in a world that are gradually governed by machines. People are not satisfied with merely algorithmic associations but want to know the meanings, emotions, sensibility, and identities behind data. Qualitative methods in gender studies capacitate us to engage in deep reflection about the process, dynamics, and the deeper structure of the social world to come up with a better solution to many problems of inequality. Gender studies is an interdisciplinary field, but in this course, we will focus on the qualitative research methods used by feminist inquires in the social sciences. Students will be exposed to a variety of qualitative research methods from fieldwork to beyond. Epistemology of gender research and what is considered feminist research will be introduced. We will cover important qualitative cases and the associated ethical issues. In order to understand the process of applying qualitative research methods, students will apply the knowledge learned in class through designing and conducting their own mini qualitative research project. They will report the progress of their research in class through group presentations or assignments to receive constructive comments from the instructor and fellow students. Respect and tolerance of different voices are important to the course.",

This course aims to introduce students to the tools and frameworks needed to approach DEI from a leadership perspective. Students will gain a deep understanding of the organizational, cultural, and intergroup contexts in which DEI initiatives arise, which DEI initiatives work and why, the drivers that motivate DEI initiatives, and the opportunities and barriers to building effective DEI initiatives in organizations. The course is designed to help students navigate diverse organizational settings more effectively, work within and lead diverse teams, and apply DEI frameworks to address organizational challenges. The course also provides students with the opportunity to critically discuss topics such as identity, discrimination, micro-aggressions, and equity in society, and how these themes relate to organizational issues of power, privilege, opportunity, inclusion, innovation, and organizational effectiveness. By the end of the course, students will have the knowledge and skills to be inclusive leaders and advance DEI in business and other settings.",

Various aspects of romantic love and intimate relationship will be critically reviewed. Based on research from a wide range of disciplines including gender studies, cultural studies, sociology, psychology, counselling, media studies, among various fields, together with input from literature and popular culture, the course will cover major areas such as the following: how do we understand the notions of “love” and “intimacy” in the different social and personal contexts, what are the different stages in a relationship; the influence of cultural myths and social scripts; interpersonal processes within romantic relationships (such as attraction, social cognition, communication and conflicts, etc.); how social gender role shapes romantic feelings and behaviors; notions of equality and freedom within relationships; power and violence; intimate relationship across life span, etc. Students are encouraged to actively reflect upon their own life experience, to engage in critical discussions of cultural phenomenon through case studies, and learn to untangle the cultural myths, norms, and stereotypes that shapes our private lives and our society in general. Upon the completion of the course, students should demonstrate basic understanding of structure, functions, dynamics, and development of romantic love and other interpersonal relationship. The personal is political. As personal relationships are the most basic social relationships that makes up the larger network of social relationships, it is hope that students could use knowledge from this course as an insight to understand, develop, and improve the quality of their own interpersonal relationship, and would aspire to build a more open and equal society starting from equalitarian and mindful personal relationships.",

      "description": "(UGEC3204 is double-coded with GDRS3006.)  Living Feminisms is all about how to put feminism into practice. Specifically, it is concerned with living out feminist consciousness in every step of making fundamental and lasting social change. With this in mind, Living Feminisms is not an exposition of feminist theories per se but an exploration of how social change effort would look like when we take up feminist consciousness that transcends separateness and duality. It explores the root causes that lead to the domination system that has plagued humanity for centuries, examines the possibility of having a fundamental and lasting social transformation that supports life of all, and takes a closer look at a few selected alternative practices such as restorative justice and sharing economies that hold out hope in times of crises. The course also equips students with practical knowledge of being a change agent, introducing some practices with feminist consciousness that transform limiting beliefs about social change, nourish resilience by taking care of social and political trauma, and cultivate need-based facilitation skills and leadership that help navigate conflicts in the process of making internal as well as external transformation. To put it in a nutshell, Living Feminisms is a course that cultivates change agents with feminist consciousness.Living Feminisms deeply resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint for building a sustainable future by 2030. The course directly touches on alternative practices working towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).",

It will pay special attention to the exploration of the relationships between multiple dimensions of social relations and inequalities including gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation. It will address issues such as: male socialization, boyhood culture, male body images, male friendship, male sexuality and fertility, men’s experiences as fathers, male aggression and violence, men’s commitments to sports and work, and media representations of boys and men in contemporary culture. It will also explore female masculinities and queer masculinities and to what extent they post challenges to hegemonic masculinity. Students will be introduced to the latest developments and their global networks, and to evaluate the prospects for social change in how men may think, feel, and act otherwise.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) through critical engagement with different discourses and phenomenon related to masculinities.",

It explores processes of how the family is constructed in different forms as it intersects with various social systems including kinship, marriage, class, ethnicity, religion, and political economy. Particular attention is paid to how family as a gendered construction, while being a basic principle of social life globally, exhibits great diversity as it shapes and is shaped by local histories, traditions, and state policies. In an era of globalization and transnational mobility, the ideology and practice of the family are rapidly changing, but there are simultaneously trends of reversion and localization. Students will read ethnographies and develop cross-cultural perspectives on classic and contemporary issues concerning the family, such as work and domesticity, motherhoods and fatherhoods, sexual orientations, reproductive technologies, surrogacy and adoption. Students learn to critically think and articulate about family issues, and will acquire enhanced knowledge and skills in reflexive thinking and positive communication, cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion.

      "description": "This course is one of the first courses dedicated to understanding trans-ness and trans-hood grounded in lived transgender experience in the East-Asian, especially the Sinophone, context. Conceptualised and co-taught by a trans person, the course adopts a holistic life approach, informed by first hand trans-perspective, in examining different aspects of our cis-hetero-patriarchal society (among many other exclusionary structures such as ableism, racism, ageism, etc.) through trans encounters in the everyday. Starting with tracing the evolution of terms in relation to the transgender identity, the exploration would be followed by reflections of the origin of the idea of “trans”, namely that of transgression and crossing-over, as an act of going beyond binaries. When inspecting gender frameworks in the “non-West”, especially those of formerly colonized societies, we can see how different understandings and imaginations of sex, gender, and sexuality would yield very different identifications, and thus human possibilities. Following more conceptual reflections, the second part of the course would be focused on societal structures as lived trans experiences, ranging from more social topics such as design and access of public facilities, the omnipresence of gender as identifier in everyday spaces and institutions, legal struggle for rights and recognition, to more intimate ones such as natal family ties, romantic relationship, sexual explorations and expressions, and reproductive experiments.The final part of the course would be an exploration beyond, reaching out to situate transgender issues within a larger context of other movements for progress and equal rights. Drawing from his experience as the city’s most prominent trans activist and a transgender support group organizer for over a decade, the instructor will be guiding the students in a critical examination of important debates within and outside of the transgender and the extended queer community, inspecting in-depth the simultaneous solidarity and tensions among different groups, from the increasing polarization and politicization of different interpretations of Feminism, to questioning the “imagined community” of LGBTQIA+ comradeship in HK and abroad, reflecting on the standing of transgender persons and transgender issues in the here and now.  The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) through critical engagement with different aspects, discourses, and phenomenon related to trans identities and their life experiences.",

      "description": "(UGED3206 is double-coded with GDRS3011.)  In 21st century post-colonial Hong Kong, the preservation of ‘collective memory’ of this fast-changing city has become an everyday discourse. From award-winning movies, heart-warming testimonies, tabloid stories to Facebook groups and social campaigns, we have been consuming, constructing, and circulating narratives of ‘the past’. This act of remembering and exploring ‘our history’ questions a mainstream Hong Kong story of success demonstrated by economic development and material wealth, and attempts to identify discontinuities, gaps and silenced voices in the dominating narrative. It has also prompted reflections on the relation between narrative and identity — personal, collective, and spatial — in historical inquiry, and in what ways the writing of history has been shaped by disparate ideals, values, web of relations and power. This course will revisit Hong Kong’s history through the exploration of narratives documenting women, a group often made invisible in history writing, as social actors in the fabric of colonial Hong Kong. From elites’ households to textile factories, from rural villages, western-district brothels to mid-levels convents, schools and hospitals, women of different generations have worked as caregivers, breadwinners, pioneers, and educators while contesting the prescribed subordinate status as objects of exploitation in a patriarchal society. Drawing from a wide range of sources, including archival documents, published biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, family histories, school histories, and oral histories, this course will seek to introduce a multi-faceted history of colonial Hong Kong with women as the focus of inquiry. The discussion of women’s narratives will be situated in respective historical contexts linking the personal to social, political and economic changes in Hong Kong under colonial rule. It will also discuss the use of auto/biographies and oral histories as a methodology in historical research investigating the relations between memory, self and identity.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by directly engaging in critical reflections that help students work towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).",

Institutions such as lineage and family, marriage, religion, medical practices, art, education and politics shape our life patterns as well as social mores. Gender, as one of the building blocks of society and culture, shapes our values and is deeply embedded in our daily lives, and it weaves an intricate ideological fabric that strongly impacts our thoughts, feelings and action.  Through the exploration of selected issues in Chinese culture which are significant and relevant to everyday life, this course introduces to students historical materials which relate to, and contemporary research on, the role of gender in the making of history and culture, and how history and culture work to shape our understanding of gender. As they participate in the learning activities of the course, students will be gradually led to understand Chinese culture from a new perspective. Furthermore, students will have a chance to reflect on long-held values and beliefs which they themselves have acquired as members of this culture, or which they witness in the daily life of the community around them. While helping students to further understand the Chinese culture and history in a new gendered perspective, this course resonates with the Sustanable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by United Nations, including SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Students reflect on their various values and concepts in daily life through this course, and become a global citizen with an open mind.",

For example, what is quality education (SDG goal 4) and why is it important to evaluate it with a gender perspective? Do men and women really differ in their abilities, and if so, by how much? Is personal interest a better explanation of gender imbalances in occupations? What are the ways that biases exist in education and the workplace, and how do teachers, parents, and employers contribute to gender biases (SDG goal 5)? Can gender equality in performance and hiring be improved by removing stereotypes? The literature will cover childhood, adolescence as well as adulthood in order to provide insight into the age-related changes of the gender issues. Particular attention will be paid to issues that relate closely to daily life, both local and international. Empirical evidence will be reviewed to illustrate the gender biases and substantiate the explanatory theories. Potential interventions to address gender biases in education and the workplace will also be discussed.",

The key questions are: How/Why/What/When innovation(s) are gendered? We will discuss the fluidity and messiness of doing and undoing gender in innovation practices and meanings produced. Broadly defined, innovation refers to new ideas, new knowledge, new technologies, new designs, and creative practices with the goal to solve social or technical problems. Many innovations may seem gender-neutral but are inherently imbued with gender perceptions. The course will equip students with ways to apply gender analysis to decipher innovations and innovative processes. The course incorporates sustainable development goals (SDGs) on Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities to become more discerning toward more sustainable practices to advance Industry Innovation and Infrastructure. Using case studies from the technology culture, the routine practices, and the emergent new economy, students will learn to untangle how gender intersects with the seemingly neutral artefacts of innovation and technology. The course further covers how emergent issues of diversity and inclusion, AI and information technology, social entrepreneurship and social innovation, and leadership style could reshape the existing relationship between gender and innovation to advance sustainability and social resilience.",

      "description": "(UGEC3214 is double-coded with GDRS3026.) This course examines the rich tradition of feminist film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates. Topics will include the key semiotic and psychoanalytic approaches of the 1970s-1990s, classic films which have inspired feminist debate, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, independent cinema, and postmodern cinema, as well as recent cinematic re-conceptualizations and exploration of gender and sexuality local and abroad. In systems of representation from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, women have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object “to-be-looked-at,” in Laura Mulvey’s now often quoted words. Following her trail, feminist critics turned their attention to mainstream films and popular media addressed to female spectators and exposed the contradictions within and between the notion of “women’s pictures” and the diversity of female experience. Local cinemas and independent creators also tell their own unique stories of women’s lives in dramatically different cultural contexts. Critics from other fields further complicate these images by examining them through lens including race, class, ability, queerness, and more.Mulvey’s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the place of women as spectacle or passive object in films “cut to the measure of [male] desire.” Critics around the world showed how different groups of women attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. What happens when female-identified artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? This course starts with the paradigm of narrative film analysis that Mulvey outlined in the 1970s and move on to explore a wider range of questions in feminist film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, (g)local cinema, and new feminist media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by female filmmakers worldwide, special focus will be placed onto important works in Hong Kong cinema for critical examination and comparative studies. Through critical reflections on notions such as gender stereotypes, representation, power, diversity, and equality, the course engages directly with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).",

This course examines the rich tradition of critical film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates, concerning “minority” identities and subalternity. Addressing key discussions about media representations of “minority”, the course will look at the politics of representation and its impacts, both on- and off-screen. We will be looking at how media works to construct “the Other” in different contexts, and delve into important work which have inspired minority cinema, subaltern cinema, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, and independent cinema among other counter-movements, as well as recent re-conceptualizations and exploration of representations marginalized identities, positions, and experiences, local and abroad. Across different systems of representation, from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, different groups, especially marginalized ones with little access to the mechanisms of production, have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object “to-be-looked-at,” in critical film theorist Laura Mulvey’s now often quoted words. Lacking representations both behind the camera and in front of it, how are the lives of different social “minorities” affected by biased media representations? How are stereotypes and biases created, disseminated, perpetuated, and reproduced through media, and to what consequences? Mulvey’s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the standings of different socially and culturally marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities, queer communities, and people with disabilities, etc., as spectacle or passive object “in films cut to the measure of desire” of the dominant social groups.What happens when “minority” artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? Critics showed how different marginalized groups around the world attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. Minority cinemas and independent creators have been actively carving out space to tell their own unique stories of lives at the margin in dramatically different cultural contexts, and these images are further complicated by engagements with them through the intersecting lens including ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, ability, queerness, and more.In the course, we will look at how socially marginalized groups, such as gay and lesbians, transgender persons, ethnic minorities, women in different stages of their lives, people with mental illness, teenagers, the elderlyand many others are portrayed, and seek to expand their on-screen existence in Hong Kong media. In the exploration, we will engage with key questions in critical film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, systems of media production, pro-sumer culture, (g)local cinema, alternative cinema, and new media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by “minority” filmmakers and media creators worldwide, and important cinematic and media movements that challenge the status-quo. Special focus will be placed onto important works in Hong Kong and Asia for critical examination and comparative studies. Through critical exercise and reflection on notions such as power, diversity, equality, and freedom, the course aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).",

      "description": "Words can keep one another at arm’s length, while bringing people together. This paradoxical nature, coupled with the fact that we cannot not communicate, makes our interpersonal lives moderately challenging and, more often than not, a source of joy, fulfillment, and connection, as well as frustration, unhappiness, and even conflict. In the 1960s, having witnessed humanity's capacity for both violence and care, clinical psychologist Marshall Rosenberg sought to develop Compassionate communication (also known as Nonviolent communication) to foster love, truth, and courage. This model enables people to stay connected with themselves and others by identifying and expressing their underlying basic needs, even during times of conflict. Not only does Compassionate communication nurture connection, but it also provides various tools to shift the mode of influence from power-over to power-with in collaborative settings, contributing to a peaceful and inclusive future. In fact, Compassionate communication has been recognized by UNESCO as one of the best practices for nonviolent conflict resolution in both formal and informal education worldwide. As working with people from diverse backgrounds becomes increasingly common, the ability to communicate across differences is essential. This course will cover all the essential concepts, processes, and skills of Compassionate communication for both personal and social life. Through interactive learning in the form of role plays, demonstrations, and real-life scenarios, the course will cultivate students' awareness of their needs and their ability to authentically express themselves. Students will learn to listen with empathy, make life-enriching requests, apologize without self-blame, navigate conflict, hold difficult conversations, and facilitate collaboration across differences.",

It demonstrates how gender challenges mainstream historical analysis and explanations. The focus is placed on the changing meanings and practices of femininity/masculinity across time. Issues such as gender transgression, homosocial relationships, marriage, sexuality and reproduction will be explored, both to shed light on, and to question our familiar perceptions of China. By examining the interaction between historical context and gender politics, this course also provokes reflections on methodologies, sources and discourses.",

      "description": "The course will examine the relationship between the development of gender and sexual identities and that of the contemporary politics mainly in, but not limited to, Asian societies. We will look into how the contemporary politics and gender structures in the regions interplay and produce racial identities through the lens of gender. For example, the Korean-Japan and China-Japan dispute over issues of comfort women in World War II; Gender activism in Gaza and Arab Spring, the female suicide bombers in middle-East, and religious right-wing movements in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Students will learn how to examine the issues of gender and sexual identities and how they are deeply embedded within the global politics as well as local social mores. Specifically, the course is divided into two parts. First of all, we will review the key theories of citizenship, war, democracy, nationalism, human rights and so on – through the lens of gender. Students are expected to learn the core theoretical debates and methods through reading key texts. The second part of this course will analyze these theories and debates through cutting-edge case studies. Topics will include comfort women, sexual violence in war, terrorism, female suicide-bombers and right-wing religious movements, human trafficking, grassroots feminist organizations, anti-war activism and so on. Students are expected to establish a more solid and critical range of views to examine these global issues and political controversies.",

      "description": "The course will investigate contemporary women’s transnational migration from developing countries to newly developed countries in Asia and beyond. We will look at Filipina, Vietnamese and Chinese women migrating to Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the United States for marriage and employment. We will discuss issues related to labor and marriage migrations, as well as trafficking in women, on both macro- and micro-levels. We are going to ask: how does the global economic restructuring shape the gendered migration today? What makes female labor different from male labor in the global labor market? What are push-and-pull factors that trigger these women to leave their hometown to be workers or wives in foreign countries? What difficulties do they experience after entering host societies and what impact would the migration flow bring to both laborer/bride receiving and sending countries? Moreover, we will explore the global market formation of transnational commodified marriages between women from developing countries and men from more developed countries. Taking the matchmaking industry in Taiwan and Vietnam for example, we will ask: how should we perceive the subjectivity of women who marry abroad through brokers? How could we challenge the assumption that the brokerage business in transnational marriage is part of human trafficking practice, and women involved in this activity are victims? To better address this issue, we may also need to address the question: what is trafficking in women? How are women represented in the global anti-trafficking campaign and how the politics of charity influences the state’s immigration policymaking and women’s transnational mobility? We will approach these issues from a critical perspective in order to challenge given social perception that ignores women's agency at work. Throughout the semester, we will read theoretical and empirical works from many disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, political economy and women's studies. In addition, we will read primary source materials including news reports, online forums and watch documentaries and film clips.",

      "description": "Humans all over the world are inevitably gendered, either voluntarily or involuntarily, in tangible behavior and in perception, from birth to death.Indeed, it is difficult to identify an aspect of human existence, be it ability, health, preferences, beliefs or opportunities,that does not have some flavor of gender. These gender phenomena do not arise from nowhere in adulthood but can be traced from childhood following a complex interplay of social, cognitive, and biological processes. They manifest in rich forms at various points of development. This course tackles the study of gender from a human developmental perspective, with the aim of understanding how gender phenomena arise, develop and change from infancy to older age, how they can be described and how to explain them with an eclectic theoretical approach that balances various developmental forces. The course also emphasizes an understanding of the methodology in empirical studies of age-related changes and causes and consequences of behaviours. Students are expected to engage actively in the identification and analysis of the relevant issues in real life, both of others and their own. At the end of the course, students will gain a critical understand of the role of gender in shaping human development, gain insight into what has led them to become who they are, and be more informed about how to deal with gender phenomena constructively at various life stages.",

Students will be led to examine aspects of the selected topic, conduct a critical literature review, formulate research methods that gather data to address the selected research question, analyze the data (if empirical), and discuss the conclusions and implications of the findings. Supervisors are expected to be experts in any discipline who are able to supervise a research project that includes gender/sex as one of the major components. Students are required to regularly discuss with the supervisor about their research and submit written progress reports as scheduled by the teacher and a complete written thesis of about 8,000 to 10,000 words in length (excluding tables, figures, bibliographies, and appendices) at the end of the year. Students will present their work in an academic mini-conference.",

How feminist theorists have understood the signifi cance of sexual difference will be considered and how feminism is articulated with theories of representation, subjectivity, and history will be discussed. In the process, how difference and differences work, conceptually and politically, paying particular attention to the complex relations of gender, racial, and class difference will be attended to. This course therefore provides a comprehensive introduction to the contemporary key approaches, theories and debates of feminist theory and the relationship of theory and practice.",

      "description": "“Gender” is not only a social category but also a perspective of seeing the world. As a discipline, gender studies draws on a variety of knowledge in humanities and social science and shapes its methodology and methods to challenge existing hegemonic knowledge that is considered being produced scientifically. The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the intellectual debate between feminist epistemology and scientific knowledge production as well as to equip them with the abilities of critical thinking about their methodologies and conducting research with proper methods. Topics include: 1) critical questioning of the validity of knowledge production, the power relations between the researcher and his or her research subjects, and the representation of the research and the researcher; 2) cautiously examining the influence of globalization on feminist research and the intersectionality among race, class and gender; and 3) innovatively connecting theory with praxis through participatory action and writing. We will begin with a brief introduction to the history and development of feminist research, followed by discussions on feminist methodologies by exemplary researchers. In the final weeks, we will shift our focus to the application of theory and groundbreaking feminist writing through collaboration. To make sure students are capable of conducting their own research using a feminist framework, this course also requests students to conduct a mini study and engage in narrative analyses. After taking this course, students are expected to be familiar with feminist approaches of conducting research and able to reflect on the knowledge production of their own research in the future.",

Drawing on feminist and critical theories, and Nonviolent Communication, the course will explore the myths of human nature that stand in the way of a large-scale and sustainable social transformation, and discuss the dynamism between gender, feminisms and civil society. The first four lectures will lay a theoretical foundation that cultivates a need-based perspective, weaving the gap between the personal and the social. On that basis, the course will examine how feminist-inspired campaigns intervene into social issues of significance to contemporary world, namely space, body politics, neoliberalism, and institutional reform. Alternative practices such as restorative justice, shared economy, ecovillages and intentional communities, new ways of governance such as Holacracy and Sociocracy will be introduced.",

In particular, this course brings a cross-disciplinary dialogue to the influences of diverse genders and sexualities on everyday life. It argues that although diverse genders and sexualities are seemingly ‘private decisions’, there are also lots of ‘public dialogues’ about them. The course examines the lives of LGBTQI+ people in diverse domains of life, such as employment, education, and health care, and analyzes some contemporary development in policy and practice. As a whole, the course calls for reflections on living with differences in contemporary society.",

We will be reading about, analyzing, and discussing diverse empirical studies on men and women as workers, homemakers, care workers, organizers, or entrepreneurs, which provide fresh ways to look at the relationship between gender and work. This course provides students with key concepts and theories about the gendered institutions of economic development, organization, migration, and culture. Based on lectures, class discussions, and analytical practices, this course will help students to be an independent thinker and educated reader of social issues from a gender perspective.

We will begin with a brief introduction to the history and development of feminist research, followed by discussions on feminist methodologies by exemplary researchers. In the final weeks, we will shift our focus to the application of theory and groundbreaking feminist writing through collaboration.",

This course points to a variety of women's living and working conditions in China, as well as their experiences of social changes brought about by patriarchal traditions, socialist rules, market reforms, and changing policies of family planning and migration. As a result, Chinese women have appeared in various research traditions differently as iron girls, laid-off workers, working sisters, left-behind women, flower vase, housewives, dama and so on. Based on lectures, class discussions, and analytical practices, this course will help students to be an independent thinker of ideological shifts, policy changes, and social transformations from a gender perspective.
