The objective is to apply economics to particular issues of energy markets, energy planning and demand management, government regulations and policies, environmental impact and conservation, local pollution control, and new technologies.\n\nThe course will cover fundamental concepts in economics including utility and preference, supply and demand functions, cost-benefit analysis and market equilibrium, project evaluation and management, externality, and game theory. Through this course, the students will understand the interactions and possible externalities between energy, environment, economy, and sustainability. The students will acquire skills in conducting energy and carbon auditing, and also learn how to analyze the effects of government policies and regulations on energy demand and supply, prices, carbon emissions, to name a few.",

The grid’s horizontal lines are about energy consumption, involving electricity use, and direct burning of fuels including combustion engines, boilers, stoves, etc. The vertical lines are about human activities, involving major economic sectors including the industrial, transport, commercial, and residential ones. The intersections between the grid’s horizontal lines and vertical lines are the lecture topics. Each lecture has discussion over three aspects: (1) how energy is utilized; (2) what factors are affecting energy consumption in intensity and in total; and (3) how human behaviour could be changed for energy conservation and pollution control.",

And then it will cover basic device designs and energy transfer; physics and circuit models; electromechanical modeling and analysis; simulation methods and practice; and interfacing circuits. The second half semester will cover the applications of kinetic energy harvesting in various situations, including power plants, wind turbine, vibrations, hydro system, ocean waves, body motions and others, and ends with discussions on kinetic energy harvesting technology in the future. The evaluation will be based on final project, midterm exam, homework, lab report, and participation in class.",

Applications such as passive design strategies, energy efficient systems, renewable energy and building information modelling are illustrated for enhancing the building performance and fulfilling green building assessment criteria and related regulations. The course will also enable students to adopt a lifecycle assessment approach to analyze building environmental performances and tackle with concurrent environmental issues for the target of local and global carbon neutrality.",
