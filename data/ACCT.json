      "course_syllabus": "This course is about the analysis of financial information - particularly firms’ financial statements - for making decisions to invest in businesses. The primary focus is on equity (share) valuation. When buying a share in a firm, the investor wants to know what a reasonable price is to pay: What is the firm worth? The course explains how he or she answers that question by analyzing information. As financial statements contain considerable information about firms, the course involves financial tatement analysis. The methods of fundamental analysis will be covered in detail and applied in cases and projects involving\n\nlisted companies. Topics include models of shareholder value, a comparison of accrual accounting and discounted cash flow approaches to valuation, reverse engineering methods of stock selection, the analysis of profitability, growth and aluation generation in a firm, diagnosing accounting quality, forecasting earnings and cash flows, pro-forma analysis for strategy and planning, and the determination of price/earnings and market-to-book ratios. The course does not “assume market efficiency.” Rather, it develops the techniques for challenging traded prices in order to assess whether investments are appropriately priced.\n\nContent, highlighting fundamental concepts\n\nThe course will be taught with a view to designing techniques to be used in an (independent) equity research department or firm. Accordingly, the material is of particular interest to buyand sell- side equity analyst who must issue a buy, hold or sell recommendations on stocks. However, much of the material covered in the course is also relevant to the corporate financial analyst and for private equity analysis, for evaluating acquisitions, restructurings and other investments, and for calculating the value generated by strategic scenarios. By the end of the course, the student should feel competent in writing a thorough, credible equity research report or investment analysis that meets the highest standards of professionalism. The course is of interest to those contemplating careers in investment banking (particularly in the equity area), security analysis, consulting, private equity, public accounting, and corporate finance. And it will also help with personal investing. The course will be in the form of lectures, discussions, exercises, and cases, and will involve a course project.",

      "course_syllabus": "Internal auditing can be described as a management-oriented discipline which has evolved rapidly. Such evolution is partially attributable to the emergence of corporate governance after a series of corporate scandals. A robust corporate governance regime within an organisation assists how the organisation operates and how business and strategic objectives can be attained. To achieve such, management needs to properly identify and manage a number of risks which may adversely affect the organisation’s success. This is the reason why risk management forms a cornerstone for corporate governance. The next question will be how risk management strategies can be executed. This then brings the significance of internal control activities to light. There is therefore an inter-locking relationship between corporate governance, risk management and internal control activities. This course attempts to investigate these three areas and highlight how internal auditing can bring values to an organisation in the abovementioned aspects.\n\nThe course is divided into three main blocks: (i) corporate and board governance under the requirements of the Hong Kong Listing Rules (and relevant overseas requirements); (ii) risk identification, assessment and management techniques from the perspective of internal auditors; and (iii) compliance risk management with a discussion of various current business issues such as forensic investigations, anti-bribery programmes and anti-money laundering techniques.\n\nThe objectives of the course are to:\n\n(1) allow students to appreciate the relationships among corporate governance, risk management and internal controls;\n(2) equip students with an understanding of the role of internal auditor in each of the above aspects and how an internal auditor can assist top management in achieving an organisation’s strategic goals;\n(3) strengthen students’ awareness of the significance of risk management and internal controls in various important areas of operations;\n(4) introduce concepts of various contemporary compliance and auditing-related issues; and\n\n(5) strengthen students’ communication and interpersonal skills.",

On the other hand, with the increasing incidents of fraud including cyberattacks, there has been a significant rise in the adoption of fraud examination and forensic analytics which is considered as a science used to proactively seek opportunities to prevent and detect fraud, waste and abuse by levering information in corporate data assets. This course combines academic and practical discussions of the following three important interlocking areas, namely, how to utilise analytics in an audit of financial statements, how a fraud examination should be carried out and how companies should respond to cyber risks.",

Major themes are the integration of cash flow and accrual based measures of income from a theoretical perspective and the synthesis of accounting choice questions based on the asset valuation versus income measurement dichotomy. The end result will be a deeper understanding of both the structure and the process of accounting policy-making.",

Recent survey by IMA (Institute of Management Accountants) in 2016 reveals significant skill gaps in many areas employers need most, especially identifying key data trends, data mining and extraction, operational analysis, technological acumen, statistical modeling and data analysis. This course targets towards accounting students who are interested in getting hands-on experience with data analytics and rising to the challenges and opportunities big data presents to the profession.\n\nThe course will provide a basis for handling and analyzing large-scale data stored within and outside an organization and finding business insights from analyses. In the first two-thirds of the course, we will study the basic concepts and techniques related to data preprocessing, data exploration, model building and results interpretation. Instead of digging deep into technical details, the course will provide a broad survey of common approaches and focus on the pragmatic implementation of data analytics. In the latter one-third of the course, we will discuss the emerging trends in big data and their applications in the accounting profession as well as other industries. The course will try to utilize real datasets related to accounting and finance and enable students to “learn by doing” through hands-on experience with data.\n\nPrerequisites:\nStudents who take the course need a basic background of statistics.

The programming assignment will give practical experience of interacting with blockchain technology.\n\nIn the second building block, we discuss the practical applications of blockchain technology, such as how to buy, mine, store, and use cryptocurrencies, enterprise applications of blockchain (e.g., decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi)), and the future of artificial intelligence (AI) and metaverse. Industry experts and entrepreneurs will give guest lectures on the real-world blockchain applications and interact with students.\n\nIn the final building block, we discuss the accounting policies related to valuing and accounting for various crypto assets. We will also discover the regulatory risk and opportunities of the crypto markets in Hong Kong, Mainland China, and the US. The course concludes by exploring how blockchain technology can shape the future landscape of the accounting industry.",

      "description": "From a long-term perspective, Quantamental Investing in capital markets, especially in the A-share market, has vast development prospects. This course focuses on equity quantitative investment starting from company fundamentals, emphasizing quantitative investment strategies based on financial analysis. The goal is to provide students with a theoretical framework and practical guidance for fundamental quantitative investment, contributing to the cultivation of investment talent in the Chinese capital market.\nSpecifically, this course will be divided into three parts. The first part introduces the basic methods and logic of financial analysis. Grounded in fundamental principles, quantitative investment models differ from models based on statistical arbitrage or high-frequency trading, with a crucial emphasis on understanding fundamentals. The second part introduces the main alpha factors: value factor, quality factor, and momentum factor etc. The value factor exploits investors' cognitive biases to identify undervalued stocks, the quality factor evaluates company performance to find stocks expected to generate value appreciation, while the momentum factor identifies stocks with continued price increases due to insufficient investor reactions to information. Both the value and quality factors require a rigorous foundation in fundamental analysis, reflecting the modern concept of value investing (value + quality), while the momentum factor serves as an effective measure of investor sentiment. The third part introduces the basic methods of fundamental quantification, including factor evaluation in multi-factor models, backtesting, weight allocation, risk control, and dynamic adjustments—these are at the forefront of both theoretical and practical aspects. Additionally, this part will demonstrate how to implement and test these alpha strategies using professional software.",

Combining theories with practical knowledge of corporate governance practice, we tackle issues such as government intervention on state and non-state firms, accounting opacity and fraud, ineffective board monitoring, expropriation of controlling owners against minority shareholders, and succession in family firms.",

He sees the past and present as other people do; but he judges the future in a different way.\" (Human Action, Ludwig von Mises, 1966)\n\nEntrepreneurial activities have become a potent source of economic power that generates enormous job opportunities and business innovation globally. This is particularly spectacular in the context of China where there are numerous cases of successful and failure cases of privately owned enterprises and collectively owned township and village enterprises growing from an embryonic stage into a larger firm.

Normally the student would prepare a literature review on the selected topic. It would then be common for the student to perform some application or extension of this body of knowledge by extending or substantiating that knowledge by some data collection.
