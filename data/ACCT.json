      "description": "The advent of technology and data analytics is posing both opportunities and challenges to the accounting professions. On one hand, stakeholders are demanding a more relevant, efficient and meaningful audit of financial statements, driving the accounting profession to conduct the audit engagements using a more in-depth risk-based methodology. On the other hand, with the increasing incidents of fraud including cyberattacks, there has been a significant rise in the adoption of fraud examination and forensic analytics which is considered as a science used to proactively seek opportunities to prevent and detect fraud, waste and abuse by levering information in corporate data assets. This course combines academic and practical discussions of the following three important interlocking areas, namely, how to utilise analytics in an audit of financial statements, how a fraud examination should be carried out and how companies should respond to cyber risks.",

This is accomplished by exposing the students to empirical accounting research and by creating an awareness of the endogenous factors affecting accounting decisions. Major themes are the integration of cash flow and accrual based measures of income from a theoretical perspective and the synthesis of accounting choice questions based on the asset valuation versus income measurement dichotomy. The end result will be a deeper understanding of both the structure and the process of accounting policy-making.",

Recent survey by IMA (Institute of Management Accountants) in 2016 reveals significant skill gaps in many areas employers need most, especially identifying key data trends, data mining and extraction, operational analysis, technological acumen, statistical modeling and data analysis. This course targets towards accounting students who are interested in getting hands-on experience with data analytics and rising to the challenges and opportunities big data presents to the profession. The course will provide a basis for handling and analyzing large-scale data stored within and outside an organization and finding business insights from analyses. In the first two-thirds of the course, we will study the basic concepts and techniques related to data preprocessing, data exploration, model building and results interpretation. Instead of digging deep into technical details, the course will provide a broad survey of common approaches and focus on the pragmatic implementation of data analytics. In the latter one-third of the course, we will discuss the emerging trends in big data and their applications in the accounting profession as well as other industries. The course will try to utilize real datasets related to accounting and finance and enable students to “learn by doing” through hands-on experience with data.Prerequisites: Students who take the course need a basic background of statistics. Having a passion for learning new things is important for the course.",

      "description": "From a long-term perspective, Quantamental Investing in capital markets, especially in the A-share market, has vast development prospects. This course focuses on equity quantitative investment starting from company fundamentals, emphasizing quantitative investment strategies based on financial analysis. The goal is to provide students with a theoretical framework and practical guidance for fundamental quantitative investment, contributing to the cultivation of investment talent in the Chinese capital market.Specifically, this course will be divided into three parts. The first part introduces the basic methods and logic of financial analysis. Grounded in fundamental principles, quantitative investment models differ from models based on statistical arbitrage or high-frequency trading, with a crucial emphasis on understanding fundamentals. The second part introduces the main alpha factors: value factor, quality factor, and momentum factor etc. The value factor exploits investors' cognitive biases to identify undervalued stocks, the quality factor evaluates company performance to find stocks expected to generate value appreciation, while the momentum factor identifies stocks with continued price increases due to insufficient investor reactions to information. Both the value and quality factors require a rigorous foundation in fundamental analysis, reflecting the modern concept of value investing (value + quality), while the momentum factor serves as an effective measure of investor sentiment. The third part introduces the basic methods of fundamental quantification, including factor evaluation in multi-factor models, backtesting, weight allocation, risk control, and dynamic adjustments—these are at the forefront of both theoretical and practical aspects. Additionally, this part will demonstrate how to implement and test these alpha strategies using professional software.",

He sees the past and present as other people do; but he judges the future in a different way.\" (Human Action, Ludwig von Mises, 1966)Entrepreneurial activities have become a potent source of economic power that generates enormous job opportunities and business innovation globally. This is particularly spectacular in the context of China where there are numerous cases of successful and failure cases of privately owned enterprises and collectively owned township and village enterprises growing from an embryonic stage into a larger firm. The course adopts a “life-cycle” approach and develops a set of accounting and managerial skills to analyze companies from the start-up stage to eventually cashing out.",

Normally the student would prepare a literature review on the selected topic. It would then be common for the student to perform some application or extension of this body of knowledge by extending or substantiating that knowledge by some data collection.
