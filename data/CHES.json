      "description": "Religion remains an important cornerstone of the global Chinese community today. This course offers a unique hands-on exploration of religion in contemporary Chinese society, emphasizing its presence and influence in everyday life. The course goes beyond religious texts to immerse students in the richness of Chinese spiritual life, demonstrating how religious traditions in China are not merely philosophical concepts, but living practices that shape the everyday experiences of individuals and communities.\n\nA special feature of this course is that we will take students on visits to a variety of religious sites in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area to experience firsthand the diversity and vibrancy of religious life in China. This includes participating in meditation sessions, attending religious festivals, and learning the intricacies of the tea ceremony in a Buddhist setting. These hands-on experiences are designed to give students a holistic view of religion and deepen their understanding and appreciation of Chinese religious traditions.\n\nIn addition to these immersive activities, the course will discuss the broader role of religion in shaping contemporary Chinese society. We will explore how religious beliefs and practices intersect with important social issues such as economics, the environment, gender, sexuality, and politics. This holistic approach will enable students to understand the multifaceted impact of religion at both the individual and societal levels. In short, this course offers a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical experience and is ideal for students interested in understanding the dynamic role of religion in Chinese society and its daily manifestations.",

Through these themes and traditions, we analyze key issues regarding the formation of literary canon in China and how Han Chinese literati define the relationship between the Han and the non-Han, male and female, lawful subjects and outlaws in the process of literary canonization.",

It explores how emotions are shaped by historical, economic, political, cultural, and social forces. By examining family life, social class, mental health, public performances of happiness, and digital interactions, students will gain insight into how emotions are constructed, expressed, and managed in various contexts.\n\nThrough case studies, personal narratives, and ethnographic accounts, students will critically analyze how emotions like happiness, shame, bitterness, and depression intersect with broader social expectations and transformations. This exploration also invites students to reflect on their own emotional experiences and the cultural underpinnings that transcend academia, potentially influencing how they think about their own ways of being in the world.",

      "course_syllabus": "Week 1: Introduction to the Course: What is Emotion, After All?\n\n* This lecture will introduce the concept of emotion as well as its relevant concepts feeling and affect, and their relevance in the socio-political context of contemporary China. It will explore how emotions are both a result of and a response to China's rapid transformations over the decades.\n\nWeek 2: Emotions in Transition: A Historical and Cross-Cultural Perspective on Emotional Experiences in China\n\n* This lecture will examine the historical evolution of various emotions in China and explore how the same emotions may be understood and experienced both similarly and differently across other societies.\n\nWeek 3: Caregiving and the Politics of Paternalistic Emotions\n\n* This lecture will explore the emotional labor of caregiving in China, particularly how family caregivers navigate affective expectations and the paternalistic nature of state-society relations.\n\nWeek 4: “Why Family Hurts?”: The Moral Dimensions of Emotions at Home\n\n* This lecture will explore the emotional complexities within Chinese family life, focusing on how familial relationships can become sources of both emotional support and emotional pain. It will highlight the tension between personal emotional needs and the moral imperatives of familial duty, exploring why emotions in the family context can be particularly fraught.\n\nWeek 5: Bitterness and Endurance: Narrating Pain from Lives on the Margins\n\n* This lecture will explore the emotional experiences of rural migrants in urban China, focusing on the emotions of bitterness and endurance. It will examine how migrants navigate the emotional burdens of displacement, economic marginalization, and social exclusion, often unable to fully articulate their emotional suffering.\n\nWeek 6: Class, Modernity, and Emotional Reflexivity\n\n* This lecture will examine how emotions like shame and pride intersect with social class in contemporary China. It will explore the role of personal growth groups (e.g., self-help, therapy) in constructing new emotional norms for different social classes.\n\nWeek 7: Self-Development and the Emotional Economy of Purpose\n\n* This lecture will delve into the fluctuating emotions encountered in paths of self-development in China, focusing on the search for purpose and how feelings of deflation or emotional burnout are managed.\n\nWeek 8: Performing Social Expectations and the “Good Life”\n\n* This lecture will examine how happiness in contemporary China is often intertwined with the performance of social expectations using examples such as food and weddings. Both food and weddings illustrate how happiness in China is deeply connected to societal expectations, where individuals navigate the emotional pressures of aligning personal fulfillment with collective standards of success and well-being.\n\nWeek 9: Well-being in China's Mental Health Boom\n\n* This lecture will explore the rise of mental health services in China, known as the \"psy-boom,\" and how it reflects the growing societal focus on emotional well-being. It will examine the pathologization of emotions such as anxiety and depression, and how mental health interventions are reshaping perceptions of well-being in contemporary China.\n\nWeek 10: Understanding Depression in China: Cultural Contexts the Ethnography of Emotional Stress\n\n* This lecture will explore the complexities of understanding depression in China. It will focus on how depressive experiences in China are shaped by cultural, social, and historical factors. Students will critically engage with how these depressive experiences differ from Western biomedical models of mental health and why these cultural differences matter for diagnosis, treatment, and public health policies.\n\nWeek 11: Digital Emotions: Social Media, Online Communities, and Emotional Expression in China\n\n* This lecture will explore how digital platforms shape emotional expression and community-building in contemporary China. We will examine how social media provides outlets for emotions often suppressed offline and fosters online communities around shared experiences, such as mental health. The lecture will also address the emotional impact of digital surveillance and censorship, highlighting the evolving relationship between technology, emotion, and social control.\n\nWeek 12: Indifference, Silence, the Politics of Voice in China\n\n* Drawing on examples from everyday life, as well as state-citizen relations, the lecture will explore how emotions such as indifference and strategies of silence are used as coping mechanisms or forms of soft resistance.\n\nWeek 13: Course Wrap-up: Reflecting on Emotional Landscapes in China and Personal Reflections\n\n* This final lecture will revisit the diverse emotional landscapes explored throughout the course—ranging from family dynamics and social expectations to mental health and political silence—and discuss how these affect both individual well-being and collective identity. This last section will also encourage students to engage in personal reflexivity, considering how their own cultural backgrounds and emotional frameworks influence their understanding of the material.",

      "description": "Many 20th century Chinese films were concerned with issues of nationhood, identity and history. In recent years, however, while some directors have continued to focus on the nation, others have chosen to look at the present, as well as at the effects of globalization on Chinese society and culture. This course asks that students begin to understand Chinese cinema(s) as transnational, focusing in particular on films made in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Students will be introduced to Chinese film history and criticism via an examination of selected films directed by several of Greater China’s most skilled directors.",

Analyze the role of rationalization, interiorization, secularization, and masculinization as the \"motors\" of all paradigm\n\nshift, starting with the Warring States.\n\n3. Understand how the unique character of Chinese culture is best seen in the relationship between Daoist cosmology\n\nand the Chinese writing system.\n\n4. Analyze the changing roles in Chinese society of ancestor and god worship in the creation of social ties and value\n\nsystems.\n\nKnow:\n\n1. How an elite humanist culture emerged in the Warring States period, and did so by means of a systematic\n\nphilosophical attack on the spirit medium religion of the Shang and Zhou.\n\n2. How Chinese cosmology transformed medicine and ideas of government, giving rise to new practices of self-cultivation\n\nand making possible the unification of China under Qin/Han.\n\n3. How Buddhist universalism transformed Chinese religion (Daoism) and society and contributed to fundamental\n\nchanges in the vision of self and the practice of government, as well as alternative lifestyles and forms of social\n\nempowerment for women.\n\n4. How the shift of the center of gravity from North to South China from the Song on, but also the division of China\n\nthroughout the Song provides the backdrop for the emergence of a \"modern China\" characterized by radically new\n\nforms of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism.\n\n5. How science and nationalism came to dominate elite discourse and practice from May Fourth on.\n\n6. How economics, gender, and religious revival contribute to the definition of value in contemporary China.",

      "description": "This course will use cinematic and literary texts to explore some of the most traumatic events in China’s recent history. We will focus on nine such events: the Nanjing Massacre (1937), the 228 Incident (1947), the Anti-Rightist Movement (1957), the Great Famine (1958-61), the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), the June Fourth Incident (1989), the Tibetan Unrest (2008), the Wenchuan Earthquake (2008), and the Hong Kong anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement (2019-2020). These events represent different types of (national/collective) trauma: from the mostly “centripetal” trauma of the Nanjing Massacre to the “centrifugal” traumas of the Cultural Revolution and June Fourth, and from the unique “anticipatory” trauma of the Hong Kong Handover and its long aftermath to the trauma caused by a natural disaster such as the Wenchuan earthquake.\n\nStudents will be asked to reflect on the way trauma is remembered, and on how the past is often rewritten in the service of the present. Central themes of the course will be history and its representation, the function of memory and trauma in the construction of (national) identity, the moral issues involved in the representation of trauma, and the importance of remembering and avoiding the repetition of past catastrophes.",

      "description": "This course goes beyond the idealized family patterns to examine critically recent transformations in family forms, reproductive technologies, politicized sexualities, and gender relations in China. It seeks to denaturalize notions such as family, marriage and love through contextualization--putting them back in the historical, political and socio-cultural context in which they are embedded. The questions that will be raised in class include: What factors shape the economic and social formations of intimate relationships in contemporary China? What does it mean to say that romantic love is an ideology? How do Chinese people “do” family today? Are intimate relationships formed in the virtual world any less authentic than those formed in the real world?\nThe course approaches various kinds of intimate relationships through an anthropological lens, which means that we will explore people’s intimate life experiences via ethnography. Based on a series of captivating readings, video clips, discussions and other class activities, this course invites the students to pay attention to the interconnectedness between the “private” and the “public” -- the everyday practices and the economic and socio-political processes. Moreover, this course aims to show how to conduct ethnographic fieldwork and how to use the data collected during fieldwork for analyzing intimate relationships in Chinese society.",

      "description": "This course proposes a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of Chinese cultural history conceived of as a succession of modes of rationality (philosophical, bureaucratic, and economic processes of rationalization). The focus will be on the moments of paradigm shift from one mode of rationality to another. For each of these moments, cultural facts and artifacts—thought, literature, ritual—will be examined in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems. The specific focus of this course is on the emergence of modern China in the Song-Yuan (960-1368) and of today’s China 1850 to the present. We will see how the modern attack on religion, redefined as \"superstition\", led not only to religious reform movements but also to a society in which science and the nation became the primary value systems promoted by the state.",

In keeping with the educational approach of the programme, this course encourages majors to take advantage of learning “on-site” in such an internship based in Hong Kong, mainland China or Taiwan, with the course registered during the regular academic terms or in the summer school terms. Students will be expected to provide regular progress reports to their faculty adviser through a diary or online blog or video presentation, and will submit a final report assessing the organization, its engagement with Chinese society, economy, culture, and the lessons learned for practically applying area studies knowledge and skills to this field. A final oral presentation will also be given and assessed before faculty and student peers at an annual presentation of internships.",

At the same time, the Chinese economy faces many uncertainties and considerable risks. In order to deepen students’ understanding of Chinese business and economy, this course will address historical reforms as well as crucial economic issues in contemporary China. The first part will examine how China’s economic transformation unfolded and identify crucial forces behind its current shape.

The class will first introduce various perspectives to understand the role and importance of housing in general. It will then acquaint students with some basic policy analysis and evaluation skills. The following lectures will look at the Chinese context and investigate the structural change of China’s housing system and its impacts on urban society. By way of comparison, Hong Kong’s experience will be explored as well. Subsequently the course will cover a number of current housing policy issues in both mainland China and Hong Kong, such as development of affordable housing, real estate fever, protection of private property, and housing management. Particular attention will be paid to the interplay between changes in the housing sector and broader socio-political developments in contemporary China. Site visits will be conducted in Hong Kong and/or its neighbouring cities.",

This course is designed to help students gain the knowledge of the “third sector” and civil society in the Chinese contexts (Mainland China and Hong Kong).

The course also provides comparative analysis between the Chinese contexts and western liberal democracies with a view to highlighting how global trends on social economy (e.g., impact investing, social entrepreneurship) are adapted to Chinese contexts.",

In recent years, however, while some directors have continued to focus on the nation, others have chosen to look at the present, as well as the effects of globalization on Chinese society, culture, and cinema production. This course asks that students begin to understand Chinese cinema(s) as transnational, a triangular composite of Mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong cinemas that has also been influenced by Japanese and Korean cinema.

This revival has led to the proliferation of contending conceptions of the historical form and function of Confucianism, as well as proposals to rejuvenate Confucianism in order to make it a vital cultural and psycho-spiritual (jingshen) resource in the modern world. The course examines this remarkable revival of intellectual and popular interest in Confucianism in China over the past two decades.",

      "terms": [],
      "description": "This course will offer an overview of modern Chinese history by way of some of the traumatic events of the past eighty years. We will focus on seven such events: the Nanjing Massacre (1937), the 228 Incident (1947), the Anti-Rightist Movement (1957), the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), the June Fourth Incident (1989), the Hong Kong Handover (1997), and the Sichuan Earthquake (2008). These events represent different types of trauma: from the mostly “centripetal” trauma of 1937 to the “centrifugal” traumas of the Cultural Revolution and June Fourth, and from the unique “anticipatory” trauma of the Hong Kong Handover to the trauma caused by a natural disaster such as the Sichuan earthquake. Students will be asked to reflect on the way traumas are remembered, and to which use historical events are put in different contexts. Central themes of the course will be history and its representation, the function of memory and trauma in the construction of (national) identity, the moral issues involved in the representation of trauma, and the importance of remembering. The selected traumatic events will be approached by way of their representation in film and literature.",

      "description": "In this course the connections between different cinemas within East Asia and between East Asia and the rest of the world will be explored from a genre perspective. Hong Kong and Korean crime movies, Chinese swordplay and Japanese samurai films, and horror films from Japan and Thailand: all are examples of the transnational circulation of genres, involving both processes of localization and globalization. The course will focus on three interrelated genres: the martial arts film, the Eastern Western and the crime film/film noir. Students will be invited to explore Hollywood-based genre theory, trace complex webs of creative influences, and appreciate the sameness and difference that characterizes both genre films and our globalizing world. They will also have a chance to apply this new knowledge in practice, by making a short “genre film” for screening at the end of the term.",

      "description": "This course charts the trajectory of major political and economic policies since the late patriarch Deng Xiaoping kicked off the Era of Reform in the late 1970s. Efforts to liberalize Mao Zedong-style authoritarianism – and to introduce grassroots elections and other forms of democracy – will be examined. Also analyzed will be measures taken by the leaderships under ex-president Jiang Zemin and President Hu Jintao to introduce international norms to modernize the cadre system and the civil service. “Intra-party democracy” as well as reforms in the legal and judicial systems will be assessed. The evolution and significance of Beijing’s policies toward NGOs, dissidents, the media and the Internet will also be studied.\n\nThis course also looks at reforms in the industrial, agricultural and financial sectors that have made possible China’s emergence as the world’s second largest economy. The “China model” – a mixed economy where state fiats coexist with market forces – will be analyzed. The comparative roles of state-owned enterprises, foreign direct investments and the fast-developing private sector will be examined. Also appraised will be whether Beijing is successful in turning the “world factory” into a “global innovation hub.” The course will conclude with a look at whether economic and political reforms undertaken by Beijing have satisfied the people’s aspirations – and helped render the country into a “responsible stakeholder” in the international order.",

For example, has the monumental clash between the two major world powers exposed weaknesses and dislocations in the Chinese economy as well as the party-state’s decision-making processes? Have Washington’s apparent efforts to target “Made in China 2025” shown up structural problems in Chinese-style innovation? Is the “China model” under attack? And how will the likely responses of the Xi Jinping team alter the trajectory of political and economic liberalization in China in the foreseeable future? Also touched upon will be the changing relations between American allies/quasi-allies such as the EU, Australia, Japan and India on the one hand, and China on the other.",

The following themes will be dealt with: the aesthetic evaluation of these arts; their unique artistic features; the roles of the artist and the spectator in the context of globalization; the transformation of Chinese art from a perspective of cross-cultural exchange; the influence of Chinese art on the West; the aesthetic valuation of expressiveness and descriptiveness in art; and the cultural correlation between art and society. Historically, the course will cover the following areas: the artistic importance of the Lingnan School paintings in the late Qing dynasty (c.1850-1911), the evolution of Western and traditional painting in China (1911-1949), the art development during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), the cross-cultural exchange between Chinese art and Western art (1976-1989), and the question of “Chineseness” under the conditions of globalization and digitization (1989-now).

      "description": "This course looks at the history and aesthetics of Chinese painting and its role in Chinese culture, showing that art and life often are closely intertwined with each other. The following themes will be dealt with: the aesthetic evaluation of painting; the pictorial features unique in Chinese ink painting; the roles of the artist and the spectator; the aesthetic principles of Chinese painting; the cultural hierarchy of painting, poetry and calligraphy; the aesthetic valuation of expressiveness and descriptiveness in painting; and the cultural correlation between the quality of a painting and the virtue of the painter. Historically, we will cover landscape painting since the Five Dynasties (907 to 960), the evolution of literati painting since the Song dynasty (960-1279), the evaluation of painting in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), the eccentric culture in big cities in Qing China (1644-1911), and the cultural assimilation of European painting since the 20th century. We will deal with these topics by examining major works of painting and by analyzing primary texts as well as contemporary scholarly writings.",

The main goal of the course is to see how economic conditions affected and influenced political choices and decisions of the late-Qing, Republican and Communist regimes that governed Chinese people throughout a turbulent century of war and revolution. The most important questions we are going to discuss during the course are as follows: what were the living conditions of Chinese people and how can we study them? How did the economic situation of the country influence policy making and international relations? What was the human, environmental, social, and cultural cost of the economic programmes of the empire, and the Nationalist and Communist Party policies?",

      "description": "This course will examine key issues of urbanization and urbanity in light of Chinese experiences. Urban development in China since the economic reform has been transformative in its scale and pace of city-building and is a range of outcomes such as rapid economic development, growing income inequality, massive population mobility, and serious institutional challenges. After offering an overview of modern China's quest for urbanization since the late imperial era, this course will focus on the massive and rapid urbanizing process in the post-reform era. Students will be exposed to diverse issues, such as migration, population control, land policy, housing reform, urban planning, spatial reconfiguration, social welfare, inner-city poverty, infrastructure and transportation, environmental protection, and public space. The readings, drawn from multiple disciplines such as economics, sociology, anthropology, history, political science, and urban studies will examine the socioeconomic, political and cultural factors that contribute to the process and its particularities in the late-socialist context. This course will also seek to draw comparative lessons from China's experience to obtain a comparative understanding of the complex socioeconomic consequences and diverse patterns of urbanizing processes across the globe.",
