      "description": "(UGEB1217 is double-coded with BMEG1217.)  This course exposes students to a range of state-of-the-arts developments in biomedical engineering. It invites students from various disciplines to discuss the long-term societal impacts and ethical implications of these technological advances, particularly in human enhancements beyond therapy. The course starts by illustrating the many amazing designs in our human body and yet how vulnerable we are in terms of injuries, diseases and ageing. Examples on how modern biomedical engineering helps us face our human conditions are given, such as musculoskeletal prosthetics and orthotics, cardiovascular implants, neuroengineering, stem cells and regenerative medicine, gene editing, bionanotechnology, intelligence and artificial intelligence and senses and artificial senses, etc. A historical account of human quest for “living” machine, including a brief coverage of modern movies on bionic human then follows. The course wraps up with some social, ethical and philosophical reflections on the above issues and on the meaning of being human, opening up questions concerning the perennial human quest of becoming super human.",

Describe some of the amazing designs in human body & their potential damages due to injuries, diseases, & ageing;\n2. Give examples on how engineering has helped in reconstructing damaged body parts and/or body functions, such as musculoskeletal prosthetics, cardiovascular implants, artificial sight, tissue & genetic engineering, etc.;\n3. Reflect on our human imagination about the bionic human of the future; and\n4. Discuss some of the philosophical, societal and ethical issues associated with such technological development.\n\nHigher-Order Learning and Literacy: Students will be given sets of thematic reading assignments (listed as common reading requirements in the Reading List and Reference section), and asked to question, discuss, and illustrate their readings using some instructor-prepared worksheets as guides. Throughout the subject, students will be drawn to reflect on their views on the distinct characteristics of being human. Each student is expected to critically review one of the selected books (given in the Reading List, total reading not less than 200 pages) in a book report (~2,500 words).\n\nLife-Long Learning: In this interdisciplinary subject, students will be constantly facilitated and drilled to learn across their disciplines. We regard such an interdisciplinary learning capacity an important skill for life-long learning.",
      "course_syllabus": "Human life is both amazing and vulnerable. Amazing – the designs and working of our human bodies are the envies of engineering science. Vulnerable – the best and the strongest are still mortal. We are susceptible to trauma, diseases, ageing and finally death. Advances in life science and engineering are bringing to us in fast cadence and big strides innovative breakthroughs and new possibilities in healing and rejuvenation, functional recoveries and health enablement. Powered intelligent prostheses for subjects with amputation, fully implantable artificial hearts for subjects with heart failures, tissue engineered skin for severely burnt subjects, stem cells therapies for impaired brain tissues are examples that our body can be fixed by replacing the defective components with artificial “spare parts” and other augmentative measures. At the same time, research laboratories are developing intelligent robots that can see, hear, smell, talk, walk, dance, think, and feel like human – following a centuries-long human quest for “living” machines. The mechanistic implications of these biomedical and engineering advances seem apparent – Is human a robot? Can robot one day become human? The artists among us are quick to perceive and even exploit these implications. The entertainment media have imaginatively presented many kinds of human-robotic hybrids, both as heroes and villains, often with power and abilities beyond those of a human. What could we tell about ourselves from our quests, pursuits, and dreams? How may one define the borderline between human and robot? What does it mean to be a human?\n\n| | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Course Syllabus | | | | | | **Week** | | **Session-1** | **Session-2** | **Session-3** | | 1 | | Introduction **Course Management** | **Amazing & Vulnerable Human** | YouTube Channels – Human Enhancement | | State of Science in Biomedical Engineering | | | | | | 2 | | DVD: Understanding Stem Cells | Lecture: **DNA Engineering** | **Artificial Intelligence** | | 3 | | DVD: The Brain: Episode 3 – Who is in control? | Lecture: **Neural Engineering** | Worksheet NAS, 2017, pg.1-13 | | 4 | | DVD: Brain Story: Episode #3 – Vision | Lecture: **Prosthetic Vision** | Worksheet Huxley,1932, pg. vii-xvii | | 5 | | TED Talk: Hugh Herr | Lecture: **Musculoskeletal Engineering** | Worksheet Buchanan, 2011, pg. 3-28 | | 6 | | DVD: The Brain: Episode 4 – How do I decide? | DVD: GATTACA | Worksheet Savulescu & Bostrom, pg. 1-22 | | 7 | | **Cardiovascular Engineering** | Lecture: **Tissue Engineering** | Worksheet Bess, 2015, pg.viii-xviii | | 8 | | DVD: Star Trek: The New Generations - the Measure of a Man | Lecture: **Humanoid Robotics** | Worksheet Sandel, 2007, pg. 1-24 | | 9 | | DVD: The Brain: Episode 5 – Why do I need you? | Lecture: **Living with Robots: Ethical & Social Issues** | Worksheet Lin et al, 2012, pg. 3-15 | | 10 | | DVD: The Brain: Episode 6 – Who will we be? | Lecture: **Optogenetics: using Light to Control Living Creatures** | Worksheet Baillie & Casey, 2005, pg.1-31 | | 11 | | Lecture **Transhumanism** TED Talk: Sebastian Seung - I am my Connectome | Lecture: **Critique of Transhumanism** | Worksheet Habermas, 2003, pg. 1-15 | | 12 | | DVD: Transcendence | Worksheet In-class reflection on personal enhancement | Lecture **Human Quest of Transformation** | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |",

In addition to learning Hong Kong, Chinese Mainland and Asia regulatory affairs, students would learn European and US medical device regulatory system to facilitate the medical device to be marketed around the world.\nThis course aims to give both factual and practical experiences on what is regulatory requirement and how to handle future regulatory tasks, included classification, risk management, product registration and commercial materials review.\nStudents would form teams from different disciplines and each team would tackle a particular medical device of their choices to go through the processes of the regulatory requirements. The project ideas will be put into the reality and through public channels.",

      "description": "BioMEMS is the application of MEMS (Microelectromechanical Systems) technology in the fields of biomedical and health sciences. Due to their small size (1 μm ~ 1 mm), BioMEMS have the advantages of low weight, low cost, quick response, high throughput, high efficiency, requiring much less sample/reagent, and easy system integration. BioMEMS has found broad applications in disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Various bioMEMS products have been developed, such as microfluidic devices, neural interface devices, μTAS (micro Total Analysis Systems), Lab-on-a-Chip, DNA Chips, micro drug delivery system, microsurgical tools, biosensors. This course covers the introduction of BioMEMS, techniques used in constructing the devices, patterning biomolecules, biomedical problems that can be addressed by the BioMEMS technology, as well as the associated engineering challenges.",
