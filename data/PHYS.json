      "description": "(UGEB1506 is double-coded with PHYS1004.)\nThe course aims at revealing the fundamental role that physics principles have been playing in the development of science and technology (S&T), which has drastically changed our ways of living and understanding of nature. Successful stories on the evolution of S&T in human history are introduced in the perspectives of STEM, i.e., from the discovery of fundamental Scientific (Physics) (S) principles, to applying the principles to Technological (T) innovations, solving Engineering (E) problems to make the applications viable, and with Mathematics (M) as the essential language that encompasses the whole process. Modern technology is also shown to change the ways of modern scientific investigation and accelerate human understanding of the physical world in an unprecedented speed. Science related social issues are used to help students understand the importance of using science principles and knowledge in making judgements and informed decisions. Lively demonstrations, lab visit, and STEM activities are used in class to (1) illustrate basic physics principles, (2) make physics principles more connected to students’ daily life applications, and (3) better prepare students for explaining science concepts and conducting basic educational STEM activities as an educator, publisher, reporter, and in other S&T related disciplines in the future. Secondary school physics are not required to take this course.",

The course assumes a background of HKDSE Physics. It is suitable for potential majors in science and engineering, and for those who intend to minor in physics. Topics include: Geometric optics, interference, diffraction, special relativity, quantum physics and its applications to atoms, molecules, solids, and nuclei, particle physics. Students are advised to take this course concurrently with a course in calculus. Grade Descriptors A : Demonstrate thorough mastery of principles and subject matter in the course required for attaining all the course learning outcomes. Demonstrate the ability to apply the principles or subject matter to familiar and unfamiliar situations, in a manner that would surpass the normal expectation at this level and standards that may be required at higher levels of study or research. Has the ability to express the knowledge or synthesis of ideas in a clear and cogent manner. A- : Demonstrate substantial command of principles and subject matter in the course required for attaining almost all the course learning outcomes. Demonstrate the ability to state and apply the principles or subject matter to familiar and some unfamiliar situations, in a manner that is logical and comprehensive. Has the ability to express the knowledge or application with clarity and accuracy. B : Demonstrate general and sufficient command of principles and subject matter in the course required for attaining most of the course learning outcomes. Demonstrate the ability to state and apply the principles or subject matter accurately to most (but not necessarily all) familiar and standard situations, in a manner that is logical and persuasive. Has the ability to express the knowledge or application in a satisfactory and unambiguous way. C : Demonstrate general command of principles and subject matter in the course required for attaining some of the course learning outcomes. Demonstrate the ability to state and apply the principles or subject matter to most (but not necessarily all) familiar and standard situations, but with occasional errors and/or in a manner that is fragmented. Has the ability to express the separate pieces of knowledge in an unambiguous way. D : Demonstrate partial command of principles and subject matter in the course required for attaining some of the course learning outcomes. Demonstrate the ability to state and apply the principles or subject matter to some simple situations only. Has the ability to state the knowledge or application in simple terms. F : Demonstrate little or no evidence of command of principles and subject matter in the course required for attaining the course learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements. |\n| --- |\n\n* *Course Status: Elective**\n\n# Course Content\n\n| | Topics | **Highlights of Fundamental Concepts** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | The Nature and Propagation of Light

Students are required to study the course materials after class and encouraged to raise questions and interact with the teachers and TAs. The tutorials will also involve teaching supplementary materials and doing class exercises.\n\n#### Homework\n\nHomework will be uploaded in the course website. Students are required to submit their homework to the **collection box** **outside** **Rm. 213, Science Centre**at or before the due time specified in the homework. **NO late submission** will be accepted.The **graded homework will be available in the return tray in Rm. 322** two weeks after the deadline.The problems in homework are divided into three categories:\n\n* *Basic problems (75%):** Problems that provide you with the basic and necessary training on the subject.\n\n* *Challenging problems (25%):** Problems that are more challenging, give you extra practice and enhance your understanding.\n\n* *Optional problems (0%):** Problems that are optional, more context-based and challenging, may involve new concepts for self-study. These problems will be graded but will **NOT** be counted towards your final grade.\n\nPlagiarism of homework is prohibited with zero tolerance and subject to disciplinary actions by the University. See the University policy of academic honesty in Section 8 below.\n\n#### \n\n#### Exercise Class\n\nEach exercise class is led by a TA. Guided by the TAs, you will be asked to work on one additional problem. The problem will **NOT** be given to you beforehand and the solution will **NOT** be posted on the web, so youare required to go through the entire thinking process of approaching and solving a problem during class. This is a valuable opportunity for you to train your problem solving skills and learn through interacting with others.\n\n* *Assessment Scheme**\n\nYour performance will be assessed according to the scheme below:\n\n| | **Homework** | **Classwork** | **Mid-term exam** | **Final exam** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Weight** | TBA | TBA | TBA | TBA |\n| **Date & Time** | Weekly unless otherwise stated (note due time on assignments) | TBA | TBA | To be arranged centrally |\n| **Venue** | --- | TBA | TBA | To be arranged centrally |\n\n* *Learning Resources**\n\n##### Course Website\n\n##### The course website (see this webpage for login via CUSIS: http://elearning.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk/blog/?p=36) has the following information and resources:\n\nCourse materials: lecture notes, homework assignments and solution.\n\nA notice board for announcements of homeworkassignments and important events (e.g. examination).\n\nAFacebook group **(http://www.facebook.com/groups/phys2041/**) for you share your views on the teaching of the course, ask questions, and interact with each other and the teacher and TAs.\n\n##### Textbook\n\n***HR******W*****:** D.

The course emphasizes the coupling of lecture and practical lab sessions. It is important at the beginning level to provide hands-on feeling to students on what electronic components and circuits can do.\n\n2. It is better not to schedule a separate lab session time slot. Instead, let’s say we have two 2-hour classes per week. In one 2-hour session, one lecture can be delivered and the second hour can be used for tutorial/class work. The other 2-hour session can then be used as lab session. The whole course can take place in a laboratory.\n\n3. The course is designed based on a course at MIT:\n\n<http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/special-programs/sp-764-practical-electronics-fall-2004/>",

      "description": "This core course aims at providing students with the essential concepts of solid state physics and an understanding of the properties of matter. The properties of solids are discussed using skills and concepts acquired in the fundamental subjects in physics. The course thus also serves to illustrate how physical concepts can be applied to explain the various properties of solids. Topics include: crystal lattices and structures, wave diffraction and reciprocal lattice, lattice vibrations, thermal properties of insulators, metallic behavior and free electron gas, energy bands, semiconductor physics and devices, magnetic properties, dielectric properties, and superconductivity. This is a capstone core course (subject matter) normally taken in final year of study. Students are also recommended to take PHYS3022 before taking this course.",

      "description": "This course discusses the physics of semiconductors and the principles behind selected applications. The physics of the electronic band structures, electrons and holes dynamics, effects of impurities, semiconductor statistics, and lattice vibrations will be discussed, using the technologically important semiconductors such as Si, Ge, and GaAs as examples. Transport properties and optical properties of semiconductors will then be treated. The principles of some common devices based on semiconductors will be introduced. The physics of selected semiconductor heterostructures will also be discussed. Using semiconductors as the context, the students will learn and appreciate how quantum physics, statistical physics, and elementary solid state physics can be applied to understand much of semiconducting materials, which have transformed and will continue to transform technologies and the world.",

The dissertation provides an opportunity for students to apply their knowledge acquired in lecture courses to carry out independent research. To prepare for this course, students are expected to have taken a Guided Study course or are taking a Guided Study course concurrently on a related topic by the same teaching staff (the supervisor). A combination of the literature review in the guided study and the application of the knowledge learned in the guided study and other lecture courses to investigate related physical problems should be performed. The student should report his/her progress to the supervisor on a regular basis. The dissertation to be written under the guidance of the supervisor is required. An oral presentation should be conducted to a dissertation committee of the supervisor and another invited teaching staff.",
