      "description": "(UGEB1506 is double-coded with PHYS1004.) The course aims at revealing the fundamental role that physics principles have been playing in the development of science and technology (S&T), which has drastically changed our ways of living and understanding of nature. Successful stories on the evolution of S&T in human history are introduced in the perspectives of STEM, i.e., from the discovery of fundamental Scientific (Physics) (S) principles, to applying the principles to Technological (T) innovations, solving Engineering (E) problems to make the applications viable, and with Mathematics (M) as the essential language that encompasses the whole process. Modern technology is also shown to change the ways of modern scientific investigation and accelerate human understanding of the physical world in an unprecedented speed. Science related social issues are used to help students understand the importance of using science principles and knowledge in making judgements and informed decisions. Lively demonstrations, lab visit, and STEM activities are used in class to (1) illustrate basic physics principles, (2) make physics principles more connected to students’ daily life applications, and (3) better prepare students for explaining science concepts and conducting basic educational STEM activities as an educator, publisher, reporter, and in other S&T related disciplines in the future. Secondary school physics are not required to take this course.",

The basic usage of generative AI will be introduced, and students will be expected to practice the AI tools in computer simulation. Topics include: the cooling problem, single and many particle dynamics, chaotic dynamics, random processes, wave phenomena, and electrostatic problems. There are computational laboratories for practice, demonstration and illustration of the subject matter. Students are expected to have a solid background in the introductory calculus-based physics courses: PHYS1111, 1122, 2041 and first-year mathematics course: MATH1010, and have written working computer programs before taking this course. Students are advised to seek prior advice from the instructor before enrolment.",

Students are also welcome to express your concerns and comments on the course in the forum.\nRemarks on Design:\n1. \nThe course emphasizes the coupling of lecture and practical lab sessions. It is important at the beginning level to provide hands-on feeling to students on what electronic components and circuits can do.\n2. \nIt is better not to schedule a separate lab session time slot. Instead, let’s say we have two 2-hour classes per week. In one 2-hour session, one lecture can be delivered and the second hour can be used for tutorial/class work. The other 2-hour session can then be used as lab session. The whole course can take place in a laboratory.\n3. \nThe course is designed based on a course at MIT:\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu/courses/special-programs/sp-764-practical-electronics-fall-2004/",

      "description": "This course discusses the physics of semiconductors and the principles behind selected applications. The physics of the electronic band structures, electrons and holes dynamics, effects of impurities, semiconductor statistics, and lattice vibrations will be discussed, using the technologically important semiconductors such as Si, Ge, and GaAs as examples. Transport properties and optical properties of semiconductors will then be treated. The principles of some common devices based on semiconductors will be introduced. The physics of selected semiconductor heterostructures will also be discussed. Using semiconductors as the context, the students will learn and appreciate how quantum physics, statistical physics, and elementary solid state physics can be applied to understand much of semiconducting materials, which have transformed and will continue to transform technologies and the world.",
