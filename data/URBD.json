The course will study this topic from an interdisciplinary perspective. A range of topics in urban economics will be discussed including planning policies related to urban environment, migration, and transportation, as well as, zoning and livability issues, and potentials for more sustainable, just and livable cities. Students will become familiar with contemporary urban economic research and online sources of economic data. The course will prepare students to develop criteria for value judgments about the complex social, economic and environmental impact of urban design and planning.",

The first part of the course covers general aspects such as research ethics, scoping of research areas, conceptualizing research frameworks and identifying relevant research questions. The second part provides students with the relevant research methods and skills for urban design, such as conducting field studies, surveys and semi-structured interviews, as well as performing a range of qualitative and quantitative analyses. Throughout the course, students will learn how to relate their findings from their mixed-method studies to address complex urban issues. The course is coordinated with students’ work in the design studio and prepares them for their final thesis project. Assignments are organized according to sub-themes linked to the core issues of urban design.",

The effect of different environmental factors on the built environment is discussed in detail. Design features, such as building’s orientation and form, are closely related to the design details of other design features. The quantitative aspects of the interactions between various design details are discussed with practical examples demonstrating such effects. It also examines the applications of climate-sensitive and environmental urban design in enhancing the living quality as well as the health and well-being of citizens.",

The student shall learn to formulate research and/or design problem, define researchable questions and develop solutions for the defined problems.\nStudents will implement their knowledge on an advanced level and demonstrate an in depth capacity to address challenges stemming from the complex ways in which cities function, grow and develop. The students will gain the professional and theoretical tools to conduct an in depth research as well as to implement their skills and knowledge through the process of design or a written report.",
