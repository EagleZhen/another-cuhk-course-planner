      "description": "(UGEC1835 is double-coded with ANTH1410.)  This course introduces students to characteristic aspects of Hong Kong culture. It will cover a wide range of cultural changes that have taken place since WWII. The course starts with an introduction to anthropological research in Hong Kong, and looks at topics including village culture and urbanization, food culture, marriage, family and gender, religion, and popular culture. Underlying most topics are questions of the modern versus the traditional, rural versus urban, cosmopolitan versus parochial, and how all these opposites interact to construct culture in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has been developed at a rapid pace since WWII. This course also discusses to what extent the development in Hong Kong meets the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular in the area of gender equality, cultural inclusiveness, and socially responsible production and consumption.",

      "course_syllabus": "What is the purpose of studying contemporary theories and controversies in anthropology? This course is designed to provide a set of tools that will enable students to see the world in a new way, to begin to understand the “strange” practices of others no less than to begin to recognize the “strangeness” of our own practices. Here, “theories” are not abstract concepts, but instead are tools that let us notice new things about the world, about being “human,” and about how both work. This course will provide students an introduction to the major contemporary theories, theorists, and ongoing controversies in the analysis of human societies in all their diversity. Through the theories that these anthropologists and social thinkers have constructed to help them make sense of the societies they have studied, anthropologists address many key issues such as \"What role does “culture” play in a globalized world of movement, flows, and unequal power relationships?\", \"What is the relationship between the individual and society and how does this help us understand the complex relations between economic and political structures and individual agency?\", and \"How can the study of ongoing cultural diversity help us understand what it means to be a person within global capitalism and new media technologies?\" By the end of the course, students should have a basic understanding of the major theories and theorists in contemporary anthropology and be able to apply these theories to the analysis of society and culture in their own communities and contemporary life.\n\n1.

      "description": "How can we understand the minds of other people? Do people in different cultures or societies feel and think in different ways? How do childhood experiences affect people and shape or even determine what kinds of persons they will become? What is it like to be mentally abnormal or even pathological? Do people in different cultures or societies experience, understand, and treat psychopathology in different ways? This course examines psychological experiences—feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and motivations—from social and cross-cultural perspectives. It sets out to explore the intersection between anthropology, a field that typically turns to the exotic other, and psychology, a field that often takes the universality of mental activities and mechanisms for granted. Specific focus is placed upon how ethnographers, clinicians, and researchers with training in both fields grapple with various mental phenomena and different ways of understanding them. As most of the materials are drawn from psychological anthropology, this course also serves as an eclectic introduction to this subfield, which was once influential in the history of American anthropology.",

It examines the intersection between anthropology and psychology, with a specific focus on how ethnographers, clinicians, and researchers with training in both fields grapple with various mental phenomena and different ways of understanding them.\n\nWeek 1. Introduction\n\nThe course is divided into three parts. The first part “Depth Psychology and Its Cultural Formulations” begins with the Freudian psychoanalysis and its discovery of the unconscious, which has almost become the hallmark of the modern mind. This is followed by a discussion on the encounter of psychoanalysis with 19th-century anthropology that has resulted in imaginative meditations on culture and civilization.\n\nWeek 2. The Discovery of the Unconscious\n\nWeek 3. Is Oedipus Complex Universal?\n\nWeek 4. Culture as Collective Neurosis\n\nWeek 5. Civilization and Its Effects\n\nThe second part “Culture and Personality and Beyond” deals with some of the most serious endeavors to explore the minds of non-western cultures and societies from the side of anthropology, with a particular focus on the “culture and personality” school that once dominated American anthropology in the middle of the 20th century. The most important strands of studies that derived from it, including comparative childhood studies, phenomenology, and ethnopsychology, are also introduced here.\n\nWeek 6. From Configurations to National Characters\n\nWeek 7. Cultural and Personality with a Psychoanalytic Bent\n\nWeek 8. Comparative Childhood Studies\n\nWeek 9. Phenomenology and Ethno-psychology\n\nThe last part of the course “The Abnormal Mind” shifts the focus to psychopathology. It begins with culture-bound syndromes that once flourished in the literature of transcultural psychiatry, followed by an extended discussion on the psychotic condition—a fundamental human mental process—and its institutional treatment, and ends with the latest efforts in anthropology to explore the individual mind in society.\n\nWeek 10. Culture-Bound Syndromes\n\nWeek 11. The Psychotic Mind\n\nWeek 12. The Asylum\n\nWeek 13. Explorations of Subjectivity",

      "description": "(UGEC2655 is double-coded with ANTH2324.) This course is an anthropological introduction to contemporary India, its social life and diverse cultures. India is home to more than a billion people, who look differently, speak various languages, practice different religions, and have distinct rituals, cuisines, and music. It is one of the world’s powers with global economic, political, and intellectual influence. Moreover, it shares important ties in the sphere of philosophy, religion, and medicine with China and other Asian societies. Therefore, students will learn about India’s place both in the world and the Asian region, including its ties with Hong Kong. Students will also develop an understanding of the country’s diversity and complex social phenomena such as kinship, communalism, caste system, tribe, third gender, and class. We will discuss pressing issues and theoretical debates related to globalization, sexuality, social movements, religious conflicts, public health, environment, and labor, and how these issues have been shaped by post-colonial politics and current transnational processes.",

      "description": "(UGEC2657 is double-coded with ANTH2327.) This course provides an introduction to contemporary Japanese society and culture. In the popular imagination, Japan occupies a complex and often contradictory position. It is home to futuristic anime and an aging population, picturesque villages and dolphin hunts, high-end cameras and the widespread use of quaint fax machines. Engaging with anthropological literature, students will learn to analyze, discuss, and write about various issues and cultural features of Japan, including youth, popular culture, self, family, labor, medicine, and health. An overarching theme will be how Japanese culture and society is changing in the transition to a highly aged society. We will examine persistent cultural patterns as well as the emergence of new forms of social life as residents of Japan grapple with smaller families, precarity, migration, and a rising population of older people. Students will learn how to apply theoretical concepts from anthropology and think critically about Japanese culture and its portrayals in the media. The ethnographic approaches and theoretical perspectives covered in this class will be applicable to other cultural contexts. Since Hong Kong, China, and Korea are following Japan’s path of population aging, this course provides an opportunity to explore cultural issues that have a local and regional significance.",

All societies have some beliefs in another world, yet beliefs vary widely between societies. The course will examine traditional anthropological topics such as magic, traditional healing, divination, fengshui, witchcraft, and ghosts, as well as more recent issues such as ESP, psychokinesis, qigong, vampires, zombies, monsters, UFOs and alien abduction. The role of myth in modern society and the cultural creation of reality will be highlighted. The power of a cultural approach in explaining the supernatural and the limits of what science can explain will also be discussed.",

In societies across the world, people have different culturally-shaped senses of what their lives mean: people may live for money, love, honour or fame; for family, company, country or religion. This course examines the processes through which meanings of life are formulated and maintained in day-to-day life in societies past and present; it also explores life meaning as a way of comprehending the evolution of human societies. The course uses the concept of \"meanings of life\" as a window into the anthropological understanding of cultural difference and cultural evolution.",

      "learning_outcomes": "In this course, students learn about the processes through which individual meanings of life are formed and negotiated between individuals and their societies; they learn this through reading and analysis of individual life stories in different societies, and (optionally) through conducting and analyzing their own interviews. Students also learn about the evolution of senses of meaning across human history, from prehistory up until the present and future, in a range of different societies.\n\nTaken together, these two areas of learning will enable students to think about human societies past and present, and about human lives lived within these societies, from a new perspective. In addition, it is expected that students will be able to think about their own lives and personal meanings in a deeper and broader and more conscious way; in this sense, although this course is academic, it transcends the purely academic, to have a potential impact on students' own thinking about how to\n\nlive their lives.\n\nBy the end of the course, students will be expected: a) to be able to think objectively, analytically and critically about meanings of life within their own and other societies, and understand the complex linkages between individuals and society in creating meaning, b) to be able to comprehend the broad panorama of the evolution of meaning over the course of human history, and c) (this objective, although discussed in class, is purposely left untouched by examinations) to be able to understand their own lives in a fuller and more insightful way.",

It looks at death and death ritual in both modern and pre-modern contexts and analyses it socially, psychologically, politically, and culturally.

      "description": "(UGED2666 is double-coded with ANTH2360.) This course introduces students to the study of morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself. This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways. The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues. Students will be invited to conduct research into the mundane things ordinary people do to take care of one another in daily life.",

Hong Kong, with its dominant image as an Asian global city as well as gateway to mainland China, has been representing itself with an image of East meets West for its tourist attractions in the last century. In order to maintain this image for its world visitors, there is no doubt that Hong Kong needs to find a balance between its global metropolitan aspect and unique cultural heritage with local characteristics in many ways. Yet, before moving on for extensive intangible heritage preservation, we might want to think about: What kind of heritage do we want to pass down to the coming generations? What kind of long-term policy do we have? How should the intangible heritage preservation and management be carried out? In this course, different types of intangible heritage in Hong Kong will be introduced and explained, and students will be guided to discuss and rethink the use and meanings of heritage from a socio-cultural anthropological perspectives.",

      "description": "(UGEC2950 is double-coded with ANTH2380.)  This course pays attention to the environment and its relation with human experiences. Through the lens of environment, we bring human diversity into presence, examining ways of life of peoples—from Indonesia highlander to Tokyo urbanites—and their words and deeds to tackle crises of planetary scale—climate change, nuclear disaster, air pollution, waste, deforestation. Facing these crises, can anthropological inquiry of the environment help us to explore a humanity that can accommodate living beings of all kind? How can such inquiry inspire us to make changes that create a world we can live together? We’ll follow these trails in the environment to look for engagement and conversation: cultural perception on the origin of agriculture, resource use and religious belief, debating traditional ecological knowledge, globalization and state intervention, environmental justice, land dispossession, waste and pollution, disaster and extreme environment. Through ethnographies of people who are struggling to survive, this course asks why they are pushed into poverty, how their resources being exploited, what they do to fight for justice; it covers SDGs related to the issues of sustainable agriculture (SDG2), tacking climate change (SDG13) and promoting peace, justice and institutional accountability (SDG16).",

      "description": "(UGEC2664 is double-coded with ANTH2390.)This course will examine the role and importance of sports in different societies and cultures, in the present and the past. Sports are often thought of as trivial, or as unimportant games to amuse young people. But in the wealthiest countries, sports represent huge portions of GDP and are important topics of daily conversation. Almost half the world watched the 2010 football/soccer World Cup. Sports have been compared to religions in their ability to unite people and to inspire fanatical devotion.The academic study of sports is interdisciplinary, with contributions from psychologists, historians, gender studies scholars, sociologists and anthropologists. This course will take an interdisciplinary approach while emphasizing anthropology’s focus on culture, on the experience of participants, and on both symbolic and political-economy aspects of sports. Topics will include Race and Performance, Sports and Rituals, Sports as Moral Education, Gender and Sexuality in Sport, Sports and Nationalism, Globalization of Sport, the Olympics, and Sports Stars and the Media. Students will be expected to do a research project for the course.",

      "description": "(UGEA2180 is double-coded with ANTH2410.)  This course provides an anthropological approach to examining Chinese culture and society. Some of the key questions we raise include: What does it mean to be Chinese? What role does culture play in being Chinese, and what constitutes Chinese society? Our emphasis is on the dominant cultural practices of societies around the world that render them ‘Chinese’. The course will also situate contemporary China historically within the world-system and examine the dramatic transformations it has undergone as a result of the post-Mao reforms beginning in the late-1970s. Because China has become the world’s most dynamic growth-engine since these reforms were launched, the Chinese experience offers itself as a case-study of the benefits as well as challenges thrown up by modern development. Since China has committed to implementing the 2030 development agenda, including Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as clean water, affordable clean energy, and climate action, this course will offer students the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the discourse of sustainability as articulated by the SDGs. But more than that, with specific reference to the experience of the People’s Republic of China in particular, the course will afford students the opportunity to reflect upon the apparent contradictions existing between what is understood to be ‘development’ on the one hand and ‘sustainability’ on the other.",

Situating the PRC in a historical and global context\n\n5. Vignettes of Maoist China\n\n6. The Anthropology of Post-Reform China\n\n7. Discussing post-reform China in light of the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nWhat does it mean to be Chinese? What role does culture play in being Chinese? And what constitutes Chinese society? When Chinese populations elsewhere (e.g. overseas Chinese) lay claim to being Chinese, what are they invoking? On the other hand, when ethnic Chinese Hong Kongers claim that they are not Chinese, for instance, what are they implying? Is being Chinese primarily given by ethnicity, nationality, cultural/civilizational practices, some combination of the above, or all of them?\n\nThis line of questioning would suggest that when we invoke “Chinese culture and society”, we refer not only to culture and society in China but also beyond, to Chinese societies elsewhere that have emerged as a result of the Chinese diaspora. Yet at the heart of this discussion still lies the question with which we first began: what does it mean to be Chinese? And what binds mainland Chinese societies with those overseas?\n\nBecause the shared identity of being Chinese has here been shown to transcend geographical and national boundaries, I would propose that being Chinese pertains more to the evolving practices of culture than it does the more limiting constraints of ethnicity, geography, or nationality. This class therefore examines the constituents of being Chinese, with the emphasis placed on culture as its animating force.\n\nAccordingly, we begin the course by underlining the significance of “culture” to being “human” and trace out the implications of this proposition. (Topic 1).\n\nIndeed, it is because culture is a cumulative and evolving social phenomenon – a process - that accounts for the diversity of Chinese societies around the world (e.g. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan), that there is something identifiably Chinese in each of them, yet something else that differentiates between them. A pluralist cultural view of “Chinese” - a civilizational view (?) - will thus be taken as we tease out the similarities and differences existing across these societies. (Topics 2 and 3).\n\nAfter discussing the differences between the Chinese societies of the world, we will turn our attention to examining the People’s Republic of China (PRC), whose breathtaking economic development over the past forty years is not in question. Because China - and the PRC, specifically - is a political entity that has had a history of antagonistic relations with the West, the course approaches discussion of China by first problematizing it as a political and historical entity, including its Maoist-Socialist past. (Topics 4 and 5). Such historic contextualization of China is felt to be necessary, the pre-requisite for any discussion of contemporary China, not least its post-Mao developments.\n\nThis brings us to the many aspects of post-Mao and post-reform China, the last forty years that have come to be associated with China’s famed developmental experience. (Topic 6).\n\nThe consequences of Chinese development - especially in the post-Mao era - speak to most, if not all, of the SDGs, which can be understood to refer to sustainability in three realms: economic, social and ecological. Hence, the anthropology of post-reform China (6) will necessarily highlight issues pertaining, for instance, to poverty and hunger alleviation (SDG 1,2), health and well-being (SDG3), gender (SDG 5), inequality (SDG10), energy (SDG7), and urbanization (SDG 11), among others. This is conducive for a discussion about the SDGs with reference to Chinese development and an examination of whether or not, and when, they are consistent.",

      "description": "(UGEA2332 is double-coded with ANTH2420.) The remarkable economic emergence of China and Asia more broadly in recent decades has transformed many impoverished and largely agriculturally based societies into the most dynamic region of the contemporary world. China’s burgeoning aspirational middle classes, rapid urbanisation, time-space compression and the shift from command economies to de-regulated markets have had profound effects on people's everyday lives and the diverse cultural practices that have long shaped local livelihoods and community expectations. This course offers an introduction into anthropological approaches to the study of culture, modernity and globalisation in China and Asia more broadly. Relevant themes that have attracted anthropological interest include changing traditions and popular culture, adaptive custom and cosmopolitanism, migration and citizenship, identity politics and social movements as well as distinctive and emergent forms of governance in both collective and self-cultivating forms of expression. Drawing on a rich corpus of social theory and ethnographic research from anthropologists past and present, the course will provide students with conceptual and analytical tools to appreciate adaptive cultural practices in comparative terms, to review and appreciate the key anthropological debates and influential works in the study of modernity, and to introduce students to ethnographic approaches for researching and writing on modernity and contemporary ethnographies of global connection.",

One aspect we will examine is how European\n\ncolonialism influenced modern nation-building processes in countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Myanmar/Burma. In this respect, we will focus on how traditional features of social organization such as ethnicity, religion, politics and economics have been transformed and deployed to govern the modern states of Southeast Asia.\n\nPart Three of the course will examine social institutions such as gender and sexuality and foodways in Southeast Asian societies as well as the various challenges that modern day Southeast Asia faces, including environmental degradations, climatic catastrophes such as the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 as well as the recent Cyclone Nargis that hit Myanmar in May 2008, and ethnic/religious conflicts and human rights concerns in the region.\n\nParticipation: 15%\n\nMap Quiz: 15%\n\nTerm Paper: 30%\n\nFinal Test: 40%\n\nMost updated syllabus and assessment will be announced in class.",

This course will examine the role of culture in contemporary business and study work and management in industrial societies anthropologically. Students will be introduced to the cultural logics of business practices, particularly business operations, organization and management through ethnographic explorations of different cultures, locales and sociohistorical settings. The aims of the course are twofold. First, it reveals cultural aspects and the cultural mechanisms of business. It shows the significance of culture in the business world, as well as the cultural significance of business. Second, it attempts to put anthropology into business practice. It demonstrates to students how anthropological knowledge and methodologies can be applied to business operations and help to achieve business goals. By examining the themes including but not limited to the indoctrination of work ethics, labor relations, gender and racial issues in the workplace, capitalism and its discontents, and responses to and actions upon market capitalism in terms of both production and consumption, the course attends to these Sustainable Development Goals: No Poverty (SDG#1), Gender Equality (SDG#5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG#10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG#17).",

      "course_syllabus": "The course is structured in three parts. *Part I Culture in Business* explores the cultural dimensions of workplaces and corporate management. We begin with an overview of the temporal and spatial reconfigurations since industrialization in order to discern modern work ethics, followed by explorations of dynamics in the workplace. Next, we will explore discourses in shaping corporate operations and management, and consider (and challenge) the ideas of economization, maximization, auditing and accountability. This part decodes life in business settings, and practices in corporations. *Part II Business Ventures in the Globalizing World* situates the discussions in current trends of capitalism. We will look into what makes us buy and spend, and how traditional values and modern business practices mingle. It raises the question of whether we are really emancipated under the fashion of decentralization by exploring the gig economy and the phenomenon of self-enterprising. We will also examine how we can build a more inclusive, diverse and equal society by finding a new way out from the existing business ideologies and practices. *Part III Anthropology and the Business World* discusses how to apply anthropology in business settings, looking into how and why anthropology and anthropologists are important to the private sector, and broadly speaking, to the modern capitalist world. The course concludes by contemplating whether business is really business.\n\nOverall, through the examinations of how we are taught to work, produce, and buy, the imperative of gender and racial stereotypes in the workplace, turns in capitalism and the rise of new economies and the pertinent social and cultural phenomena, the course addresses the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): No Poverty (SDG#1), Gender Equality (SDG#5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG#10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG#17).\n\n* *Core topics:**\n\nWeek 1 Course Introduction\n\nWeek 2 Seeing Business Anthropologically **(SDGs 17)**\n\n* *Part I Culture in Business**\n\nWeek 3 Space, Time and Work Ethics **(SDGs 8, 10)**\n\nWeek 4 Gender, Race/Ethnicity, and Communication in the Workplace **(SDGs 5, 8, 10)**\n\nWeek 5 Corporatization, Economization and Maximization **(SDGs 1, 8, 10, 12)**\n\nWeek 6 Audit Culture and Accountability **(SDGs 8)**\n\nWeek 7 Mid-term Test\n\n* *Part II Business Ventures in the Globalizing World**\n\nWeek 8 The Making of Consumers **(SDGs 10, 12)**\n\nWeek 9 Fieldtrip to a Social Enterprise/ a Social Innovation Project/ an exhibition about reindustrialization in Hong Kong\n\nWeek 10 The Gig Economy and Self-enterprising **(SDGs 1, 8, 10)**\n\nWeek 11 Ethical-Political Consumerism and Social Entrepreneurialism **(SDGs 1, 5, 8, 10, 12, 17)**\n\n* *Part III Anthropology and the Business World**\n\nWeek 12 Applying Anthropology to Business Practice **(SDGs 10, 17)**\n\nWeek 13 Conclusion: Is Business Really Business?",

Globalization is economically transforming the world, as national borders become increasingly irrelevant before the global flow of money and goods. But globalization also has a great impact on cultures across the globe, as products from Coca-Cola to iPods, and ideas from human rights to ideals of beauty to ideologies of terrorism, intrude everywhere. This course examines how globalization is fundamentally transforming the meanings of culture. The course objectives are to enable students: (1) to have greater insight into the processes of “the globalization of culture\"”, and (2) to better understand the nature of their own culture and selves within a globalizing world.",

We consider a wide range of phenomena that can be called violence within diverse historical and cultural contexts. Violence is always political – whether it is manifest in the spectacular practices of torture, terrorism, or genocide, or the invisible structures of inequalities that generate educational, health, and food inequities. Specifically, we will address four SDG goals in depth: SDG#1 No Poverty, SDG #5 “Gender Equality”, SDG# 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG #10 “Reduced Inequalities” and SDG #16 “Peace, Justice and strong institutions”; The topics covered will be understood in relation to histories of colonialism and nationalism, ideologies about race, gender, and variant forms of social, economic, and political hierarchies. We further examine the effectiveness and limitations of human rights and humanitarianism as remedies, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",

      "description": "(UGEC2665 is double-coded with ANTH2540.) This course addresses the ways in which social media and other related interactions in cyberspace have become a central element in the everyday lives of humans across the globe in the 21st Century. Our modern lives are now largely interwoven with digital technologies that have not only changed our own cultures, but also have brought forth new cultural forms through mobile phone technologies, networked “smart”-products, and cultural groupings only possible through digital means. The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes—the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives. The role of anthropology in understanding and capturing human culture in this context anchors on the investigation of how technology is possibly making us ‘more’ human than previous forms of cultural life.",

      "description": "(UGEC2656 is double-coded with ANTH2550.) Work is a central practice and system of human production, innovation, social organization, and cooperation. Focusing on the work-place as 'working cultures', this course offers an anthropological perspective to understand how work is a matter of place, time, power, and meanings. We will further explore how current social, technological, and cultural transformations of work can be understood across places, in their historic continuities and disruptions. Each week the course analyzes, discusses, and rethinks a key concept in the anthropology of work: Class, time, race, gender, value, craft, ownership, creativity, autonomy, discipline, etc. Through reading contemporary ethnographies of different workplaces and circumstances, students will learn the analysis and theory of work in familiar or unexpected forms, as well as in different organizational settings from the office, factory, workshop, home, to online platforms. This course will further give the students the tools to systematically connect their own observations of work to writing about working cultures.",

      "required_readings": "* *Working Class I: Gender in the Global Factory**\n\nWork-places are social institutions that reproduce various relationships of society. By analyzing international technology hardware-production in Mexico, we will see how different ways of task organization, hiring practices, and promotion regimes shape gendered production as much as class and gender relations beyond the factory.\n\nSalzinger, Leslie. 2003. \"Chapter 1: Ways of Seeing\", \"Chapter 4: Bringing Fantasies to Life: Panoptimex\" + \"Chapter 5: Re-formulating the 'Traditional Mexican Woman': Particimex\". In: Genders in Production: Making Workers in Mexico's Global Factories. Berkeley: University of California Press.\n\n* *Working Class II: Race in Migration**\n\nFollowing high-skilled IT-workers from India to Berlin this ethnography explores how immaterial work in an office can be embodied and ascribed to race rather than skill. Understanding work and its hierarchies within transnational and local class aspirations and shifting racial stereotypes, we will explore the experience of work as both empowering and discriminatory.\n\nAmrute, Sareeta. 2016. \"Introduction: Cognitive Bodies, Cognitive Work (until p. 18)\", \"Chapter 2: The Postracial Body\". In: Encoding Race, Encoding Class. Indian IT Workers in Berlin. Durham: Duke University Press.\n\n* *Working Place and Space**\n\nAll work-places exist in multiples spaces from global markets, supply chains, nation-states, to cities. Through the case of women working the night shift in Mumbai's call-center industry, we will see how social mobility and the roles of women in relations of work, leisure, family, and self are impacted by social norms of who should work at night.\n\nPatel, Reena. 2010. \"Introduction (until p. 18)\", \"Chapter 4: Traveling at Night\". In: Working the Night Shift: Women in India's Call Center Industry. Stanford: Stanford University Press.\n\n* *Working Time**\n\nTime is crucial for structuring work and pay. Contemporary work often reorganizes time and new, flexible time regimes revolutionize our understanding of the work day. This week explores, on the one hand, time as valuable or wasted in the contemporary NGO-industry. On the other hand, we will look at time in terms of flexibility, autonomy, but also as source of anxiety for independent taxi drivers in New York.\n\nSheldon, Zachary. 2021. \"Managing the Humanitarian Workplace: Capitalist Social Time and Iraqi Refugees in the United States.\" In: Anthropology of Work Review 42 (1 ): 35- 46.\n\nOcchiuto, Nicolas. 2017. \"Investing in Independent Contract Work: The Significance of Schedule Control for Taxi Drivers\". In: Work and Occupations 44(3): 268 - 295.\n\n* *Working Self**\n\nWork is often not just a job, but a part of ourselves. But where are the boundaries between work as what we do or who we are? Through the case of sex workers in San Francisco, we will discuss themes of authenticity in customer relations, alienation, self-fulfilment, control, and abuse in service work.\n\nBernstein, Elizabeth. 2007. \"Chapter 4: The Privatization of Public Women\". In: Temporarily Yours - Intimacy, Authenticity, and the Commerce of Sex. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.\n\n* *Working Service**\n\nSimilar service work like taking care of people can take place in drastically different settings from someones house to a luxury hotel. While some workers perform their duties in public, others are confined to the domestic and intimate spaces of other people's living spaces. By contrasting the management of domestic helpers in Hong Kong with luxury hotel workers in San Francisco, we will think about how work discipline and evaluation influences performance, but also how the setting of work allows or prevents abuse.\n\nConstable, Nicole. 2017. \"Chapter 5: Household Rules and Relations.\" In: Maid to Order in Hong Kong: Stories of Migrant Workers. Ithaca: Cornell University Press.\n\nSherman, Rachel. 2007. \"Chapter 2: Managing Autonomy.\" In: Class Acts- Service and Inequality in Luxury Hotels. Berkeley: University of California Press.\n\n* *Working Craft**\n\nPractices and skill of work are often passed on, refined, and perfected through generations of practitioners. The skill of artisans and craft-workers has often been romanticized as traditional and pure. Through the reinvention of bartenders as highly skilled and creative makers in postindustrial New York, this week aims to understand how professions transform, become 'cool', and reinvent themselves.\n\nOcejo, Richard. 2017. “Introduction: A Stroll through the Market” + “Chapter 1: The Cocktail Renaissance”. In: R. Ocejo. Masters of Craft: Old Jobs in the New Urban Economy. Princeton: Princeton University Press.\n\n* *Working on Demand**\n\nWhat is creativity? What is a copy? Exploring the world of the now famous, hand-painting makers of oil painting reproductions in Dafen village, we will see what makes an artist or a worker, as well as the shifting boundary between copyrights and copy.\n\nWong, Winnie. 2014. \"Introduction: After the Copy (until p. 22)\" + \"Chapter 4: Step 18: 'Sign Vincent\"'[selections]. In: Van Gogh on Demand - China and the Readymade. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.\n\n* *Working Platforms**\n\nSocial media platforms drastically transform employment relationships, modes of contract and payment, but also meanings of profession and occupation. Through the online communities and marketplaces of game designers and car sharing drivers, we will see how work becomes more individualized or more embedded online.\n\nSchwartz, David. 2018. “Embedded in the Crowd: Creative Freelancers, Crowdsourced Work, and Occupational Community”. In: Work and Occupations 45 (3). Pp. 255-282.\n\nSurie, Aditi and Jyothi Koduganti. 2016. “The Emerging Nature of Work in Platform Economy: Companies in Bengaluru, India: The Case of Uber and Ola Cab Drivers”. In: International and Comparative Labour Studies 5(3): 1 – 30.\n\n* *Working for Free?**\n\nWhy do we work for free? Is that even possible? By looking at seemingly 'un-worklike' activities of women and promoters in the international party circuits, we ask how we can understand work beyond traditional relations of employment or exchange.\n\nMears, Ashley. 2020. \"Chapter 3: The Potlach\" + \"Chapter 4: Trafficking at Model Camp\". In: Very Important People - Status and Beauty in the Global Party Circuit. Princeton: Princeton University Press.\n\n* *Working Skill**\n\nWho has skills? What are skills? Understanding the complex social organization of building football stadiums in Qatar, this week explores how people know what to do if it has never been done before. We will further understand skill as embodied practice and matter of recognition.\n\nlskander, Natasha. 2021. \"Chapter 3: How Skill is Embodied ... \". In: Does Skill Make Us Human? Migrant Workers in 21st Century Qatar and Beyond. Princeton: Princeton University Press.\n\n* *Working Capitalism**\n\nIs all work productive? Is all work meaningful? Through this critique of contemporary capitalism as unproductive system, we will discuss the meaning of work and how to imagine new work practices in the future.\n\nGraeber, David. 2018. \"Chapter 1: What is a Bullshit Job\" + \"Chapter 4: What is it like to have a Bullshit Job?\". Bullshit Jobs -A Theory. New York: Anholt & Schuster. Selections.",

Is heritage conservation a social elite business?\n\n2. Who owns the cultural heritage, and who has the right to decide what should be reserved, and how to preserve it?\n\n3. International principles and local cultures, globalization and localization: the preservation of cultural heritage in different political, economic and social contexts/ countries—should there be “universal principles and philosophy” for heritage conservation? Is there a so-called “best practice”? Who has the right to decide what is “the best practice”?",

      "description": "(UGEB2505 is double-coded with ANTH2740.) How we understand the past defines the way how we understand our current situation. Archaeology is a dynamic discipline that has tremendously expanded our knowledge about the past, but this subject is not just about digging and doing fieldwork. A wide range of new techniques (e.g., metallurgy, zoology, and 3d stimulation) and research methods have been incorporated into current archaeological research, and eventually transformed the understanding of ourselves and our culture in many ways. This course provides a general introduction in terms of two specific domains: 1) basic archaeological science that changed the research paradigm of human culture and history; 2) an overall history about ancient technology illustrated by new research techniques to explain how this modern world took shape. Moreover, this course provides hands-on practice to cultivate students’ cross-disciplinary research skills and prepare them for the arrival of a new, digitalized research era.",

This course investigates long-term evolutionary perspectives on the human species. The basics of evolution and natural selection as scientific theories are clearly set out and examined, and common misconceptions discussed. Evidence for the evolution of mammals and primates is reviewed and discussed, and the common characteristics of these species are highlighted, demonstrating the connections between humans and other forms of life. The course covers what we know about human ancestors and the evolution of modern humans. Students are introduced to the wide range of human adaptations to local conditions across contemporary cultures and the variety of relationships that human populations have with the environment. Students are encouraged to use the knowledge they have acquired to ask: are these relationships always sustainable? Looking to the future: what are our responsibilities both to future generations of humans and towards other species with which we share our world? This course aims to give students an understanding and appreciation of evolutionary perspectives on the place of humans in the world, the variety of contemporary human societies, and a broad perspective on the complexity of the relationship between humans, the environment and other species.",

Students are also exposed to the potential for misunderstandings of scientific theory and the distinction between fact and value. Comparative abilities are emphasised through reviewing common features of the life-course of a variety of animals and the influence of animal habitats, with particular focus on closely related primate species.\n\nThe history of human evolution is introduced to students, focussing on the emergence of universal capacities such as language, technology, art and culture. Students are encouraged to learn about and appreciate the variety of human cultures and the flexibility of humans in adapting to local environments. A comparative perspective on human culture is encouraged through a focus on the common subsistence needs of all humans, and the variety of practices by which these needs are met.\n\nStudents are exposed to a wide perspective on the place of the human species in the world. They are encouraged to exercise long-term evaluations of, and exercise a sense of judgement about the impact and sustainability of human action, both in relation to the environment and other species as well as future generations of the human species.

      "description": "Religious practices and beliefs permeate cultures throughout the world and religion has always been one of the most important topics in anthropology and liberal studies. This course examines the following aspects of religion: magic and sorcery, symbolism and ritual, gender and religion, shamanism, syncretism, and social change driven by religious ideas. The course also introduces major traditions of social theory: each tradition offers a different way of looking at the role of religion in people's lives. This course thus introduces students to various forms of religious expression around the world and also exposes them to different interpretations of religion.",

      "description": "This course explores the relations between the body, love, and emotions from an anthropological perspective. People acquire a special sense of presence, knowledge, and power from the brute fact of their bodies as sentient, sensuous, instinctual, habitual, feeling, and erotic organisms. At the same time, this special presence has made the materiality of the body a contested site for representational practices and politics in which love and emotions have figured centrally. Through an ethnographic focus on cross-cultural studies of love and emotions, this course seeks to juxtapose and reconcile the body's manifold facets as materiality and representation, subject and object. We will address the following questions: What are the culturally differentiating politics and poetics of the seemingly universal emotion of love? What conceptions of the body and personhood do they articulate? How do modern notions of love and desire underscore changing gender relations, sexual identities, and embodied ideals of masculinity and femininity? How do affect and embodiment intersect with the problems of class, race, ethnicity, and nationality?",

Students will examine systems of meanings and practices that evolved around notions of love, body, and emotions across time and place, and their political significance. In particular, the cross-cultural perspective will demonstrate the intimate associations of these ‘private emotions and desires’ with social structures such as gender, class, ethnicity, and religion. It examines both the reproductive role of ideologies about love and intimacy in different societies, as well as their transformative potential.\n\nThe questions that will be raised in class include: Do bodily and emotional experiences of intimacy differ across cultures? What shape the economic and social formations of intimate relationships such as love and friendship? What does it mean to say that romantic love is an ideology? What have our desires got to do with social order? Why are some emotions and desires taboo? Is our body a product of nature or culture?\n\nMost updated syllabus and assessment will be announced in class.",

It introduces the major topics of the subfields of economic and political anthropology, as well as the goals and dilemmas of applied anthropology. The course will examine the cultural evolution of societies, how culture shapes — and is shaped by — the production, distribution and consumption of goods, the flow and accumulation of power, and the nature of conflict and governance. The course will show how a holistic cultural approach can improve our understanding of power and the economy, and how only by considering power and material life can we fully understand culture.",

      "course_syllabus": "This course will introduce economic and political anthropology, two of the major subfields of anthropology. For anthropologists, the economy is not numbers and markets, but how cultures produce, distribute, and consume goods. People in different cultures have different ways of making a living; what are the patterns and rules? Is it human nature to be selfish and\n\nalways want more things? Why do some people and countries have more wealth than others? Is poverty natural and inevitable? These are not just matters of economics, but of power. So we will examine a few aspects of political economy, from consumerism and the destruction of the environment, to nationalism, protest and rebellion.\n\nMid-term: 40%\n\nFinal exam 50%\n\nParticipation 10%\n\nMost updated assessment will be announced in class.",

      "description": "Disability may appear to be a brute fact, a form of difference readily apparent in a person’s body or behavior. But is this necessarily the case? The study of disability from an anthropological perspective is in fact a study of difference, that is, how categories of difference are made and experienced. In what contexts does bodily, neurological or cognitive difference become a problem to be solved, managed, or eradicated? How do local ideas about personhood and the good life shape the way people in different societies understand disability, impairment, and debility? What does the lived experience of disability reveal about the human condition? The study of disability from an anthropological perspective is never merely a study of a medically defined deficit. It leads instead to questions about how politics, economics, policies, social practices, moral values and the potential for human flourishing and community are co-constituted. Like other categories of difference, disability provides an occasion for questioning the normative and the hegemonic. Unlike other categories of difference, disability is a form of otherness anyone could enter into at any time.",

Ethnic Chinese communities worldwide may be considered as comprising an ethnological field. Due to the sharing of aspects of Chinese civilization, Chinese everywhere share some cultural similarities. However, the need to adapt to different ecological, political and socio-cultural environments calls for adaptation and transformation. Thus the diverse Chinese communities worldwide are ideal for comparative studies, especially on a number of anthropological/ sociological themes such as cultural continuity and transformation, cultural identities and ethnic identities, ethnic relations, social organization, and so on.",

      "description": "This course will enable students to extend their anthropological learning in the classroom to an ethnographic field site. The course combines a set of standard in-class lectures and tutorials with an 8-12 day field study trip to a location typically outside Hong Kong. The field study trip will consist of both supervised student-led field research and formal face-to-face teaching including such things as guest lectures with local experts, formal professor-guided class discussions on methodology and anthropological fieldwork, guided museum tours, and local study tours focused on the cultural, political, and economic lives of local people. Students will form small groups to investigate different anthropological topics within the field site, actually “doing” anthropology!Open only to anthropology majors or minors, including minors in archaeology and in cultural heritage studies. The contents of this course will vary with different instructors and students. Offerings under the same course code, but with different field sites can be taken for credit, up to a maximum of two times.",

      "description": "Advisory: Students are required to have taken at least one course related to gender.This course will be a cross-cultural and historical study of the contexts in which gender and sexuality are articulated and contested in law. Premised on a social constructivist understanding of gender and sexuality, the course aims to provide a set of tools for students to understand and analyze the norms and frameworks regulating human sexuality through the law. The course further locates the making of gender and sexuality in the law within histories of colonialism and imperialism. Students will learn to evaluate different legislative and judicial responses to issues directly related to sexuality such as consent, rape and adultery, prostitution and human trafficking, violence against women, homosexuality, same-sex and heterosexual marriage etc. They will also learn to examine how legal regulation of gender and sexuality extends into other areas of the law about urban space, inheritance, citizenship, immigration and asylum, as well as the prison system. The course aims at providing students with the critical tools to analyze the cultural and historical constructions that inform “laws in the books, laws in the mind, and laws in action.”",

It explores sociolinguistics — how linguistic behaviour is shaped by sociocultural factors — and also metaphor, and the problems of cultural interpretation and translation. It also examines a range of symbols in society, the language not just of words but of clothing, material goods, popular culture and political discourse, to understand how cultural symbols are socially constructed, performed and contested. Language and symbols and their social uses form a central topic of anthropological inquiry; this course will explore and explicate this topic.",

      "description": "Landscape is a reflection of past interactions between people and their physical environment, which cumulatively create highly recognizable and culturally distinctive places. Such unique and geographically-defined records of particular groups and their way of life are what UNESCO calls “cultural landscapes” (Rössler 2006). Landscapes also reflect and embody intangible beliefs and if we are to understand such ‘non-material’ meanings we must embrace both Western and non-Western (e.g. Chinese) approaches to their study. Hong Kong’s cultural landscape is overwhelmingly urban and modern in character, embedded within, beyond and beneath the city lie other ‘hidden’ landscapes reflecting more ancient belief systems and traditional practices such as agrarian and maritime lifeways and their ‘traditional’ belief systems. Also, Hong Kong has many culturally important ‘ephemeral’ landscapes, relating to the temporary transformation of spaces, for example during religious festivals, or even the more routine transformations that occur at street eateries (dai pai dong) or markets. This course explores the concept “landscape”, its tangible and intangible dimensions, how they are physically evidenced locally and abroad, and how anthropologists, archaeologists and a myriad of other disciplines approach their study and interpretation. In particular, we will work through a series of local case studies to see what landscape can tell us about the lifeways, economies, politics and beliefs of past and present communities in Hong Kong. By studying cultural landscapes we can also identify what past and present communities, organisations and governments chose to keep and protect and what they let go – by assessing such processes we can develop an understanding of the underlying socio-political and economic drivers at work through time. In terms of heritage management, therefore, if we wish to militate against the gradual loss of meaning and value in our cultural landscapes, a landscape approach is indicated.",

The field study trip will consist of both supervised student-led field research and formal face-to-face teaching including such things as guest lectures with local experts, formal professor-guided class discussions on methodology and archaeological fieldwork, guided museum tours, and local study tours focused on the cultural, political, and economic lives of local people. Students will form small groups to investigate different archaeological topics within the field site, actually “doing” archaeology!Open only to anthropology majors or minors, including minors in archaeology and in cultural heritage studies. The contents of this course will vary with different instructors and students. Offerings under the same course code, but with different field sites can be taken for credit, up to a maximum of two times.",

Different forms of social and cultural analysis will be applied to a range of local and regional case studies and students will gain an understanding of the key theoretical approaches to the anthropological study of medical knowledge, systems and practices.\n\nThe role of medical practitioners and healers, and the political and socio-economic processes shaping the health of individuals and communities, including how ethnicity and gender shape disease profiles and illness experience, are examined. A key focus is on global inequalities in relation to health status, access and the affordability of health care.\n\nRunning through the course is the in-depth investigation of illness experiences and help seeking in contemporary China where belief in Chinese medicine, biomedicine and regional healing practices co-exist. These practices are explored in light of the roles of local healers, family care giving and the different ways in which the body, birth, death and illness are managed. The explanatory role of Chinese medicine, local therapies, religion and culturally defined concepts of risk, vulnerability and fate in understanding sickness and healing is explored.\n\nAssessment:\n\nOral Presentation\n\nBriefing Paper\n\nUpdated assessment will be announced in class.",

It will also take a comparative perspective to understand China’s urban experience in the cross cultural context. Topics to be explored include the origin and development of cities, cities’ new role in the timespace compressed global system, migration, public health, citizenship, social movements, and problems of urbanization such as urban poverty, gender inequality, and social inequality.\n\nThe course is open to BA and MA students. Basic anthropology background is not required. Students are expected to read the required reading material before the class. The class lecture will compare the Chinese urban experience with that of the\n\nother cultures.\n\nA research paper is required by the end of the semester. Each student needs to interview a new comer of HK, describe the new immigrant’s experience within the framework learned from the class, and compare his/her experience to the other case\n\nstudies mentioned in the class.

Today museums are relevant to many fields such as education, science, culture, tourism and environmental protection; thus museums play important roles in contemporary societies. Topics include the definition of the museum, and analyses of the museum’s history and functions, with special emphasis on introducing how a museum is run, and the technical issues of how the artifacts and information are restored, preserved and displayed.

      "course_syllabus": "Anthropology - anthro (human) and logia (the study of) - refers to the study of humankind.\nThis is an ambitiously broad, all-encompassing field. In North America, the discipline of\nanthropology is typically broken into the four subfields of physical or biological\nanthropology, archaeological anthropology, linguistic anthropology and socio-cultural\nanthropology. Taken together, these four subfields give anthropology a unique, “holistic”\nperspective on the human experience, stressing the contribution of the biological as well as\nthe cultural – “nature” as well as “nurture” - in the formation of the human past and present.\nYet, for reasons that will be elaborated, we will primarily be examining the many themes and\nsub-fields of sociocultural anthropology. This course can be regarded as a general\nintroduction to the major currents within sociocultural anthropology.\nIt is not unreasonable to argue that the concerns of sociocultural anthropology can be traced\nto the distant past, when questions concerning social life first emerged (i.e. to the Ancient\nGreeks in the West, or to the time of Confucius in China). But we shall begin our discussion\nof the story of anthropology closer to our time (i.e. the modern period), when the production\nof social knowledge started to take on a more systematic and disciplinary guise. So, we will\nbegin our story of the development of anthropology when the discipline took on elements of\nits current disciplinary constitution in the West. In fact, it is the aim of this course to help\nstudents see the relevance of anthropological knowledge and analysis for understanding\npresent-day realities.\nWhile the analytical focus is on the present, the present inevitably calls for an appreciation of\nthe past. Analysis in anthropology thus involves the deployment of the conceptual to reflect\nupon empirical phenomena unfolding across time and space, along varying scales. As we\ninquire how the present is connected to the past, we are also compelled to ask how the local is\nrelated to the global. The empirical in turn informs and modifies the conceptual in an everiterative\nprocess of knowledge-and-reality-making. In keeping with this, our discussions in\nthis course will involve a simultaneous focus on:\ni. Major anthropological concerns\nii. The contemporary human predicament and how we got here.",

Ethnicity, racial identity or national identity is one of the prominent categories by which people are divided in contemporary world. Some of us have clear awareness of our own ethnic identity; others don’t. What makes the difference? Ethnicity is also the apparent reason of serious conflicts in the world – Kosovo, Darfur, and Rwanda, to name just a few. Why, in some cases, are people willing to die or kill in the name of their “race?” Anthropology studies people and culture; and the study of ethnicity is one way we attempt to understand the formation of people-hood.\n\nThis course starts by introducing key theories and anthropological perspectives on ethnicity. Then, we examine the emergence of ethnic groups in relation to colonization, the rise of modern nation-states, and globalization. In the third part, we focus on the politics of ethnicity. We will also discuss the making, experience and expression of ethnicity in everyday life. Finally, we will reflect on two key issues: conflicts between ethnic groups, and human rights and equality between the minority and the majority peoples. This course takes a comparative perspective; we read ethnographies of diverse societies and peoples to reconsider our taken-for-granted assumptions regarding ethnicity and to reflect on the nature and implication\nof this category.\n\nCOURSE REQUIREMENTS\nThis course is a graduate seminar and is designed to be discussion-intensive. You do required readings and submit short reading notes to prepare for the classes and contribute to class discussion. To pursue further your own ethnicity-related interests, you will write a final paper.",

This course examines the processes through which meanings of life are formulated and maintained in day-to-day life in societies past and present; it also explores life meaning as a way of comprehending the evolution of human societies. The course uses the concept of \"meanings of life\" as a window into the anthropological understanding of cultural difference and cultural evolution.

These two areas of learning will enable you to think about societies past and present and about lives lived within these societies from a new perspective. You will also perhaps learn about how to think about your own life and meaning in a deeper and more conscious way; although this course is academic, it transcends the\n\nacademic, to have a potential impact on your own thinking about your life.\n\nAlthough this course examines meanings of life from an anthropological perspective, no prior knowledge of anthropology is required: you can apply what you learn in this course to a wide range of disciplines and endeavors.\n\nAssessment:\n\n1) Take-home mid-term examination OR an interview and analysis of a person as to \"life after death and life before death\" (10 pages long: 30% of grade) AND\n\n2) Take-home final examination (15 pages long: 50% of grade) OR a paper (20 pages long),\n\n3) Class participation and attendance: 20% of grade",

      "description": "Death is both a human universal and a process deeply affected by the cultural context in which it occurs. Dealing with death, both practically and psychologically, is something that all humans must face. This course examines death and death ritual through the question of what is universal and what is culturally variant about how humans face death. It looks at death and death ritual in both modern and pre-modern contexts and analyses it socially, psychologically, politically, and culturally. From the course students will learn how the treatment of death varies cross-culturally; how understandings of death have shifted over human cultural evolution; what aspects of death are universal in human experience; and how death affects contemporary politics, economics, and culture.",

      "description": "How can we understand the minds of other people? Do people in different cultures or societies feel and think in different ways? How do childhood experiences affect people and shape or even determine what kinds of persons they will become? What is it like to be mentally abnormal or even pathological? Do people in different cultures or societies experience, understand, and treat psychopathology in different ways? This course examines psychological experiences—feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and motivations—from social and cross-cultural perspectives. It sets out to explore the intersection between anthropology, a field that typically turns to the exotic other, and psychology, a field that often takes the universality of mental activities and mechanisms for granted. Specific focus is placed upon how ethnographers, clinicians, and researchers with training in both fields grapple with various mental phenomena and different ways of understanding them. As most of the materials are drawn from psychological anthropology, this course also serves as an eclectic introduction to this subfield, which was once influential in the history of American anthropology.",

      "course_syllabus": "This course introduces students to the studies of psychological experiences from social and cross-cultural perspectives. It examines the intersection between anthropology and psychology, with a specific focus on how ethnographers, clinicians, and researchers with training in both fields grapple with various mental phenomena and different ways of understanding them.\n\nWeek 1. Introduction\n\nThe course is divided into three parts. The first part “Depth Psychology and Its Cultural Formulations” begins with the Freudian psychoanalysis and its discovery of the unconscious, which has almost become the hallmark of the modern mind. This is followed by a discussion on the encounter of psychoanalysis with 19th-century anthropology that has resulted in imaginative meditations on culture and civilization.\n\nWeek 2. The Discovery of the Unconscious\n\nWeek 3. Is Oedipus Complex Universal?\n\nWeek 4. Culture as Collective Neurosis\n\nWeek 5. Civilization and Its Effects\n\nThe second part “Culture and Personality and Beyond” deals with some of the most serious endeavors to explore the minds of non-western cultures and societies from the side of anthropology, with a particular focus on the “culture and personality” school that once dominated American anthropology in the middle of the 20th century. The most important strands of studies that derived from it, including comparative childhood studies, phenomenology, and ethnopsychology, are also introduced here.\n\nWeek 6. From Configurations to National Characters\n\nWeek 7. Cultural and Personality with a Psychoanalytic Bent\n\nWeek 8. Comparative Childhood Studies\n\nWeek 9. Phenomenology and Ethno-psychology\n\nThe last part of the course “The Abnormal Mind” shifts the focus to psychopathology. It begins with culture-bound syndromes that once flourished in the literature of transcultural psychiatry, followed by an extended discussion on the psychotic condition—a fundamental human mental process—and its institutional treatment, and ends with the latest efforts in anthropology to explore the individual mind in society.\n\nWeek 10. Culture-Bound Syndromes\n\nWeek 11. The Psychotic Mind\n\nWeek 12. The Asylum\n\nWeek 13. Explorations of Subjectivity\n\nMost updated assessment will be announced in class.",

      "description": "This course is an anthropological introduction to contemporary India, its social life and diverse cultures. India is home to more than a billion people, who look differently, speak various languages, practice different religions, and have distinct rituals, cuisines, and music. It is one of the world’s powers with global economic, political, and intellectual influence. Moreover, it shares important ties in the sphere of philosophy, religion, and medicine with China and other Asian societies. Therefore, students will learn about India’s place both in the world and the Asian region, including its ties with Hong Kong. Students will also develop an understanding of the country’s diversity and complex social phenomena such as kinship, communalism, caste system, tribe, third gender, and class. We will discuss pressing issues and theoretical debates related to globalization, sexuality, social movements, religious conflicts, public health, environment, and labor, and how these issues have been shaped by post-colonial politics and current transnational processes.",

      "description": "This course will focus on the intersection between culture and biology, and introduces major cultural concepts and theories on medicine and health. Starting with an overview of the development of medical knowledge and health care, and the role of society and culture in formulating theories and myths of sickness and healing, the course will examine issues such as culture-bound syndromes and cross-cultural stress and psychiatry; ritual, religious beliefs, and medicine; anthropological perspectives on epidemiology, pharmacology, and doctor-patient relationships; Chinese and Western medical systems; and health and inequality across ethnicity, class and gender. Students are encouraged to critically think about the interaction between biological, environmental and social factors in health and illness, and, as the world become more globalized, the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments, as well as global health. MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper. (Not for students who have taken ANT4330.)",

      "course_syllabus": "This course examines illness, suffering, healing, and care from an anthropological perspective. By doing so it serves as an eclectic introduction to medical anthropology, a sub-field of anthropology that attends to the above-mentioned issues across socio-cultural contexts. The first half of the course deals with a series of questions that constitutes the heart of the field, including how culture shapes the representations of illness, how healing occurs in a local world, and how to make sense of illness experiences through narratives. The latter half of the course builds on the discussion of these questions and explore three themes that have become influential since the 1990s: social suffering, local biology, and structural violence. In the last two weeks of the course, we’ll examine care—a mundane yet indispensable act—and its impossibility in the context of extreme violence.",

      "description": "This course provides an introduction to contemporary Japanese society and culture. In the popular imagination, Japan occupies a complex and often contradictory position. It is home to futuristic anime and an aging population, picturesque villages and dolphin hunts, high-end cameras and the widespread use of quaint fax machines. Japan also has a long and deep relationship with China, Korea, and other Asian societies. Engaging with anthropological literature, students will learn to analyze, discuss, and write about various issues and cultural features of Japan. Particular attention will be paid to youth, popular culture, family organization, labor, medicine, health, and the transition to a highly aged society. We will examine persistent cultural patterns as well as the emergence of new forms of social life. Students will learn how to apply theoretical concepts from anthropology and think critically about Japanese culture and its portrayals in the media. The ethnographic approaches and theoretical perspectives covered in this class will be applicable to other cultural contexts.",

      "description": "This course explores the relations between the body, love, and emotions from an anthropological perspective. People acquire a special sense of presence, knowledge, and power from the brute fact of their bodies as sentient, sensuous, instinctual, habitual, feeling, and erotic organisms. At the same time, this special presence has made the materiality of the body a contested site for representational practices and politics in which love and emotions have figured centrally. Through an ethnographic focus on cross-cultural studies of love and emotions, this course seeks to juxtapose and reconcile the body's manifold facets as materiality and representation, subject and object. We will address the following questions: What are the culturally differentiating politics and poetics of the seemingly universal emotion of love? What conceptions of the body and personhood do they articulate? How do modern notions of love and desire underscore changing gender relations, sexual identities, and embodied ideals of masculinity and femininity? How do affect and embodiment intersect with the problems of class, race, ethnicity, and nationality?MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper.",

The questions that will be raised in class include: Do bodily and emotional experiences of intimacy differ across cultures? What shape the economic and social formations of intimate relationships such as love and friendship? What does it mean to say that romantic love is an ideology? What have our desires got to do with social order? Why are some emotions and desires taboo? Is our body a product of nature or culture?",

Economies and Cultures: Foundations of Economic Anthropology (2nd edition). Boulder: Westview. Read Chapters 2-5 & 7).\n\nPaper topic: Use the ideas and theories in the Wilk and Cliggett book to discuss the problem of \"greed.\" For example, are bankers of Wall Street really greedy? Is hyperconsumerism caused by greed? If everyone is \"self-interested\", what is \"greed\" anyway? Can we say that there is greed at the individual, social-political and cultural levels discussed in the book? Use the ideas of the book and any examples and other sources to discuss \"greed.\"\n\nStudents interested in American popular culture may like to know that the character Gordon Gekko in the 1987 movie \"Wall Street\" famously said \"Greed is good\" (see the video clip and text of his speech at www.americanrhetoric.com/MovieSpeeches/moviespeechwallstreet.html ). He is expressing the idea that capitalism only works based on \"self-interest.\" The problem is, Gekko is a cheat and inside trader, not a law-abiding capitalist investor (see the movie synopsis here if you don't want to watch the movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/synopsis ). A writer that is now popular with the \"Tea Party\", Ayn Rand, also argued that \"greed is good.\" There are many other examples you can pick to discuss.\n\nLanguage and Communication (Gordon Mathews)\n- -Salzman, Zdenak (2004) Language, Culture, and Society: An Introduction to Linguistic Anthropology.

In The Name of Harmony and Prosperity: Labor and Gender Politics in Taiwan's Economic Restructuring. Albany: State University of New York Press.

In this Taiwan case, we see the transformation of industrial structure affected the meaning of work, work ethic, family relationship, as well as local people’s understanding of the world.

      "description": "This course introduces students to the study of ethics and morality from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Ethics and morality may appear to be an abstract subject for philosophers, but this course shall demonstrate how they are in fact a close part of our everyday lives. Human beings living in different societies have different ideas about what constitutes the good and the right. How and why do they differ? Does the cross-cultural study of morality and ethics lead to moral relativism? What are some shared human problems? How do people manage to get along with each other, and how does a person learn to get along with oneself? “Ethics and the Human Experience” will prioritize context in understanding what shapes the good and the right. But ultimately, the class aims to expand our moral imagination beyond the usual concerns, and to more deeply understand the human experience.",

It introduces the major topics of the subfi elds of economic and political anthropology, as well as the goals and dilemmas of applied anthropology. The course will examine the cultural evolution of societies, how culture shapes – and is shaped by – the production, distribution and consumption of goods, the flow and accumulation of power, and the nature of conflict and governance. The course will show how a holistic cultural approach can improve our understanding of power and the economy, and how only by considering power and material life can we fully understand culture. Students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper.",

      "course_syllabus": "This course will introduce economic and political anthropology, two of the major subfields of anthropology. For anthropologists, the economy is not numbers and markets, but how cultures produce, distribute, and consume goods. People in different cultures have different ways of making a living; what are the patterns and rules? Is it human nature to be selfish and\nalways want more things? Why do some people and countries have more wealth than others? Is poverty natural and inevitable? These are not just matters of economics, but of power. So we will examine a few aspects of political economy, from consumerism and the destruction of the environment, to nationalism, protest and rebellion.",

      "description": "Disability may appear to be a brute fact, a form of difference readily apparent in a person’s body or behavior. But is this necessarily the case? The study of disability from an anthropological perspective is in fact a study of difference, that is, how categories of difference are made and experienced. In what contexts does bodily, neurological or cognitive difference become a problem to be solved, managed, or eradicated? How do local ideas about personhood and the good life shape the way people in different societies understand disability, impairment, and debility? What does the lived experience of disability reveal about the human condition? The study of disability from an anthropological perspective is never merely a study of a medically defined deficit. It leads instead to questions about how politics, economics, policies, social practices, moral values and the potential for human flourishing and community are co-constituted. Like other categories of difference, disability provides an occasion for questioning the normative and the hegemonic. Unlike other categories of difference, disability is a form of otherness anyone could enter into at any time.",

Throughout this course we will investigate the insights that anthropological analyses can offer to discussions centering the relations between Muslim societies and the West. Students in this course will engage in in-depth reading and discussion, and will write reports and research papers on aspects of Islam.",

It will also take a comparative perspective to understand China’s urban experience in the cross cultural context. Topics to be explored include the origin and development of cities, cities’ new role in the timespace compressed global system, migration, public health, citizenship, social movements, and problems of urbanization such as urban poverty, gender inequality, and social inequality.\n\nThe course is open to BA and MA students. Basic anthropology background is not required. Students are expected to read the required reading material before the class. The class lecture will compare the Chinese urban experience with that of the\nother cultures.\n\nA research paper is required by the end of the semester. Each student needs to interview a new comer of HK, describe the new immigrant’s experience within the framework learned from the class, and compare his/her experience to the other case\nstudies mentioned in the class. A one-page proposal of the interview project needs to be submitted around the mid-term time. The proposal should include a brief description of the informant, the interview topic/focus, and the problems you have\nencountered in collecting the information.",

      "description": "The remarkable economic emergence of China and Asia more broadly in recent decades has transformed many impoverished and largely agriculturally based societies into the most dynamic region of the contemporary world. China’s burgeoning aspirational middle classes, rapid urbanisation, time-space compression and the shift from command economies to de-regulated markets have had profound effects on people's everyday lives and the diverse cultural practices that have long shaped local livelihoods and community expectations. This course offers an introduction into anthropological approaches to the study of culture, modernity and globalisation in China and Asia more broadly. Relevant themes that have attracted anthropological interest include changing traditions and popular culture, adaptive custom and cosmopolitanism, migration and citizenship, identity politics and social movements as well as distinctive and emergent forms of governance in both collective and self-cultivating forms of expression. Drawing on a rich corpus of social theory and ethnographic research from anthropologists past and present, the course will provide students with conceptual and analytical tools to appreciate adaptive cultural practices in comparative terms, to review and appreciate the key anthropological debates and influential works in the study of modernity, and to introduce students to ethnographic approaches for researching and writing on modernity and contemporary ethnographies of global connection.",

In the first half of the course, we examine values and institutions in Japan and South Korea, looking at the underlying cultural principles of the two societies, and at the ways in which the Japanese and Korean governments and societies use those principles to mold their citizens to live and think in certain ways. We also examine the relation of culture to economics in the two societies, particularly in terms of Japan and South Korea’s extraordinary economic growth over the past four decades, and recent economic difficulties. We also examine high culture and popular culture in the two societies, and the meanings of religion in the two societies. In the second half of the course, we turn to the individual lives of Japanese and Koreans. We examine the relationships of men and women in the two societies, and the meanings of work and family; we consider the social constructions of youth and age, and “the generation gap”; and we consider outsiders and insiders in the two societies, and the two societies’ relationship to the world. This course aims to enable you to better understand the particular societies of Japan and South/North Korea, but also to better be able to anthropologically analyze and compare complex societies throughout the world.",

Ethnic Chinese communities worldwide may be considered as comprising an ethnological field. Due to the sharing of aspects of Chinese civilization, Chinese everywhere share some cultural similarities. However, the need to adapt to different ecological, political and sociocultural environments calls for adaptation and transformation. Thus the diverse Chinese communities worldwide are ideal for comparative studies, especially on a number of anthropological/sociological themes such as cultural continuity and transformation, cultural identities and ethnic identities, ethnic relations, social organization, and so on.

      "course_syllabus": "How is violence used as a political instrument? How and why do governments engage in violent actions against their own citizens? What are human rights? This course examines the problems of violence and its political uses from an anthropological perspective and within a comparative framework. The range of phenomena that can be called violence is very broad and varies greatly across cultures. We focus here on violence as a political problem, and the ways in which various state and non-state actors promote their political goals through violent means, such as torture, terrorism, or genocide. We analyse the relationships between politics and violence, the emergence and use of human rights discourses and practices as a possible political remedy against mass violence, and what new forms of political authority based on human rights may entail. In this course, we will critically analyse global violence issues including genocide in Cambodia and Rwanda, mass rape in Bosnia-Herzegovina and state terror in Colombia. We question why the spread of a human rights culture cannot stop the emergence of violence all over the world. Also, throughout the course, recent human rights issues will be discussed in lectures and tutorials. The course intends to develop students’ critical understanding of everyday violence in our society and at the international level.\n\nCourse Structure\nPart I: The Human Rights Framework and Theoretical Approaches to Violence\nThis section introduces the theoretical problems surrounding violence and culture, and uses of violence for political goals by states and non-state actors. The readings introduce the contradictions between political violence and human rights, for instance in torture or terrorism. The issue of human rights cannot be understood without first giving students the tools to understand mass organized violence, i.e. what human rights aim to remedy according to the Charter of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights signed by all member states of the United Nations.\n\nPart II: Human Rights, Universalism and Cultural Relativism\nBased on the previous themes of violence and culture, this section introduces the historical and conceptual frameworks for students to analyse the emergence of discourses on human rights. It introduces the debates over the universality of human rights, which is the main source of contention for the rejection of human rights by some governments. Students will be able to analyse the question of political rationality and relativism, and apply arguments for and against the universality of human rights after this section.\n\nPart III: Case Studies on Political Violence\nBased on the concepts of violence and human rights introduced in the previous two sections, this section analyses case studies of gross denials of human right through mass violence. These case studies underline the limits of international politics based on human rights. In these case studies of paramilitary terror, genocide, and mass rape and gendered violence against women, human rights failed to provide adequate mechanisms to bring political crisis to an end. We analyse why international human rights as a political form failed to stem these instances of large-scale, organized violence.\n\nPart IV: From Violence to Justice? The Future of Human Rights\nThis last section brings the course to a conclusion by examining why and how human rights have been used to bring perpetrators of mass violence to justice, to be held accountable for their past actions in the wake of large-scale human rights violation. It will analyse the post-conflict situation in Cambodia, Rwanda and Nepal and address the questions of truth commissions, international justice trials, accountability and political transformations. The last week brings the course to a conclusion by re-analysing the discourses of human rights and the question of relativism in light of the theoretical concepts and case studies the students have analysed during the course.\n\nCourse Materials\nThere is no required textbook for this course. Students with a longstanding interest in human rights may consider purchasing Violence in War and Peace: An Anthology edited by Nancy Scheper-Hughes and Philippe Bourgois (2003) and ethnographies like Prisoners of Freedom: Human Rights and the African Poor by Harri Englund (2006), Michael Taussig (2003) Law in a Lawless Land: Diary of a Limpieza in Colombia and, Philip Gourevitch (1999) We wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families: stories from Rwanda. These works will be discussed as we go through the course.\n\nMost required reading materials will be available in the library, on the Internet and Moodle",

      "description": "This course will be a cross-cultural and historical study of the contexts in which gender and sexuality are articulated and contested in law. Premised on a social constructivist understanding of gender and sexuality, the course aims to provide a set of tools for students to understand and analyze the norms and frameworks regulating human sexuality through the law. The course further locates the making of gender and sexuality in the law within histories of colonialism and imperialism. Students will learn to evaluate different legislative and judicial responses to issues directly related to sexuality such as consent, rape and adultery, prostitution and human trafficking, violence against women, homosexuality, same-sex and heterosexual marriage etc. They will also learn to examine how legal regulation of gender and sexuality extends into other areas of the law about urban space, inheritance, citizenship, immigration and asylum, as well as the prison system. The course aims at providing students with the critical tools to analyze the cultural and historical constructions that inform “laws in the books, laws in the mind, and laws in action.”",

Each week the course is structured to explore, discuss, and rethink a key concept in the anthropology of work: Class, time, race, gender, value, craft, ownership, creativity, autonomy, discipline, etc. By learning through contemporary ethnographies of different places and circumstances, students will gain the tools to connect observation, analysis, writing and theory to explore work in familiar or unexpected forms, as well as in different organizational settings from the office, into the home and onto social media platforms.",

It explores the nature and structure of language, the underlying meanings and rules of conversation, the shaping of language by gender and social class, formal language and foul language and what they mean, and language and culture: how the structure of enculturated consciousness is shaped by language. It also examines a range of symbols in society, the language not just of words but of everyday goods and everyday life, popular culture and mass media, political discourse and propaganda, and computers and cyberspace, to understand how cultural symbols are socially constructed, performed, and contested. Language and symbols and their cultural construction and social usage form a central topic of anthropological inquiry; this course will explore and explicate this topic. After taking this course, you will appreciate much more the extraordinary nature of language, and you also will have a better understanding of how arbitrary language and symbols are in their hold over us--you will have learned to “see through symbols.”\n\nReadings from books are available in UL Library.

      "course_syllabus": "This course introduces the anthropology of gender. What is gender? How does gender shape our everyday life? What kinds of gender-related practices do we see in different societies? What are anthropological concerns of gender? This course takes a comparative perspective, emphasizing diversity among various societies and cultures, to answer these questions. We will read ethnographies and other anthropological, sociological, and historical works to examine taken-for-granted assumptions regarding gender, and consider whether gender is constructed, i.e. not natural.\n\nAfter a general introduction of the anthropology of gender, this course starts from exploring gender in different cultures, and amongst the Chinese people in different places and time. By doing so, we wish to expose ourselves to what we may not be familiar with, move ourselves out of our comfort zones, and therefore, urge ourselves to consider alternative perspectives on\ngender. The second part of the course examines the making (awareness, experience, production, and performance) of gender through various institutions and practices including family, education, nation-state, body and sexuality, production, and consumption. The third and concluding section of this course emphasizes the current context of globalization and explores particularly the impacts of migration on gender. We will revisit our initial questions about gender and culture and explore the intersection between gender and other categories of difference.\n\nCOURSE REQUIREMENTS\nThis course is a graduate seminar and is designed to be a discussion-intensive one. You do required readings and submit short reading notes to prepare for the classes, contribute to our class discussion, and pursue further your own gender-related interests with a final essay.",

      "description": "This course discusses the role of the museum in contemporary society. Museums have long been regarded as the treasure house of the cultural legacy of a country and people. Today museums are relevant to many fields such as education, science, culture, tourism and environmental protection, thus museums play important roles in contemporary societies. Topics include the definition of the museum, and analyses of the museum’s history and functions, with special emphasis on introducing how a museum is run, and the technical issues of how the artifacts and information are restored, preserved and displayed. Excursions will be made to selected museums in Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong for observation and discussion purposes. MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper. (Not for students who have taken ANT4720.)",

What are the essential elements of museum catalogues and cultural writing?\n3) How do museum workers balance both marketing and social needs?\n4) In what ways can we participate in the operation of a museum?\nThe course draws discussions from both perspectives of museum workers and visitors.

      "course_syllabus": "Shall we preserve the old things, and why? What is “cultural heritage”? Using examples in different parts of the world, this course aims to give students a concise and critical understanding on heritage conservation from an anthropological perspective. The course will introduce basic concepts and cultural contexts of the occurrence and development of cultural heritage conservation in the world, and discuss important issues in this field, including the economic, social and political meanings of heritage in contemporary societies, the impetus of preserving heritage, and the use of heritage as a social and political implement by the state, scholars, and different communities for their own interests. The course will also discuss\nproblems and challenges in this area. No prior knowledge on heritage preservation is required for this course.\n\nMajor contents of this course are as follows:\n1) Why are human beings interested in their past? Are all heritage “invented”? The origin and development of heritage conservation.\n2) Debates on heritage preservation and management:\na. Who need cultural heritage? Is heritage conservation a social elite business?\nb. Who own the cultural heritage, and who have the right to decide what should be preserved, and how to preserve?\nc. International principles and local cultures, globalization and localization: the preservation of cultural heritage in different political, economic and social contexts/countries- should there be “universal principles and philosophy” on heritage\nconservation? Is there a so-called “best practice”? Who has the right to decide what is “the best practice”?\nd. The use and abuse of cultural heritage.\n3) Heritage and indigenous people’s right.\n4) The future of human beings’ past: can heritage be preserved at all?\n\nCourse requirements:\nTwo one-hour lectures and one one-hour tutorial per week, including a group presentation.\n\nImportant note:\nAs required by the university, from Sept. 2008, students must submit a soft copy of their computer-generated text assignments to CUPIDE (the Chinese University Plagiarism IDentification Engine System) at a specified URL. The system will issue a receipt containing a declaration of honesty statement. Students should sign the receipt, print a hard copy of their assignment, and submit the hard copy and the receipt to teachers for grading.

Archaeology is a dynamic discipline that has tremendously expanded our knowledge about the past, but this subject is not just about digging and doing fieldwork. A wide range of new techniques (e.g., metallurgy, zoology, and 3d stimulation) and research methods have been incorporated into current archaeological research, and eventually transformed the understanding of ourselves and our culture in many ways. This course provides a general introduction in terms of two specific domains: 1) basic archaeological science that changed the research paradigm of human culture and history; 2) an overall history about ancient technology illustrated by new research techniques to explain how this modern world took shape.

      "description": "Why study past diets? The study of past human diet and nutrition is a key area of research in archaeology and anthropology and holds significant potential for developing a better understanding of human nutrition today. Our eating habits, biologically and culturally, are often rooted in ancient traditions of past millennia but may also reflect recent changes to society and the environment. Through lectures, discussion groups, and practical lab experiences, this course will provide students with advanced knowledge of the main theoretical and methodological approaches to studying nutrition in the ancient past. Major focuses will include stable isotope analyses, zooarchaeology, and archaeobotany.",

      "description": "Landscape is a reflection of past interactions between people and their physical environment, which cumulatively create highly recognizable and culturally distinctive places. Such unique and geographically-defined records of particular groups and their way of life are what UNESCO calls “cultural landscapes” (Rössler 2006). Landscapes also reflect and embody intangible beliefs and if we are to understand such ‘non-material’ meanings we must embrace both Western and non-Western (e.g. Chinese) approaches to their study. Hong Kong’s cultural landscape is overwhelmingly urban and modern in character, embedded within, beyond and beneath the city lie other ‘hidden’ landscapes reflecting more ancient belief systems and traditional practices such as agrarian and maritime lifeways and their ‘traditional’ belief systems. Also, Hong Kong has many culturally important ‘ephemeral’ landscapes, relating to the temporary transformation of spaces, for example during religious festivals, or even the more routine transformations that occur at street eateries (dai pai dong) or markets. This course explores the concept “landscape”, its tangible and intangible dimensions, how they are physically evidenced locally and abroad, and how anthropologists, archaeologists and a myriad of other disciplines approach their study and interpretation. In particular, we will work through a series of local case studies to see what landscape can tell us about the lifeways, economies, politics and beliefs of past and present communities in Hong Kong. By studying cultural landscapes we can also identify what past and present communities, organisations and governments chose to keep and protect and what they let go – by assessing such processes we can develop an understanding of the underlying socio-political and economic drivers at work through time. In terms of heritage management, therefore, if we wish to militate against the gradual loss of meaning and value in our cultural landscapes, a landscape approach is indicated.",

The course combines a set of standard in-class lectures and tutorials with an 8-12 day field study trip to a location typically outside Hong Kong. The field study trip will consist of both supervised student-led field research and formal face-to-face teaching including such things as guest lectures with local experts, formal professor-guided class discussions on methodology and archaeological fieldwork, guided museum tours, and local study tours focused on the cultural, political, and economic lives of local people. Students will form small groups to investigate different archaeological topics within the field site.Open only to anthropology majors.The contents of this course will vary with different instructors and students. Offerings under the same course code, but with different field sites can be taken for credit, up to a maximum of two times.",

The basics of evolution and natural selection as scientific theories are clearly set out and examined, and common misconceptions discussed. Evidence for the evolution of mammals and primates is reviewed and discussed, and the common characteristics of these species are highlighted, demonstrating the connections between humans and other forms of life. The course covers what we know about human ancestors and the evolution of modern humans. Students are introduced to the wide range of human adaptations to local conditions across contemporary cultures and the variety of relationships that human populations have with the environment. Students are encouraged to use the knowledge they have acquired to ask; are these relationships always sustainable? Looking to the future; what are our responsibilities both to future generations of humans and towards other species with which we share our world? This course aims to give students an understanding and appreciation of evolutionary perspectives on the place of humans in the world, the variety of contemporary human societies, and a broad perspective on the complexity of the relationship between humans, the environment and other species.",

Students are encouraged to learn about and appreciate the variety of human cultures and the flexibility of humans in adapting to local environments. A comparative perspective on human culture is encouraged through a focus on the common subsistence needs of all humans, and the variety of practices by which these needs are met.\n\nStudents are exposed to a wide perspective on the place of the human species in the world. They are encouraged to exercise long-term evaluations of, and exercise a sense of judgement about the impact and sustainability of human action, both in relation to the environment and other species as well as future generations of the human species.

The lectures will structure each topic in a simple way, providing explanations and examples so that the basic ideas are understood. Students will benefit by taking brief notes during the lectures.\nQuestions are very welcome, both during the lectures and especially during the later tutorial.\nAll of the reading material will be readily available either in the U Li. reserve collection or online/on the webCT site. Each week, students are expected to read, think about, and mentally summarise the readings before the tutorial.\nThe tutorial provides an opportunity for students to discuss the readings, raise questions and debate the ideas, and consolidate their understanding. Normally, tutorials will open with a short (less than 5 minutes) informal summary of the readings covered that week, given by a student. All other tutorial members will be expected to contribute to the discussion. The aims of the tutorials are\n• to enable students to make summaries of the readings and topics of their choice;\n• to raise and discuss questions, experience and perspectives about the concepts and the reading material;\n• to enable students to make suggestions for the improvement of the course/ lectures/ readings etc.",
