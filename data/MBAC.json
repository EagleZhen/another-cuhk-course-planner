      "description": "Most of the young ventures fail within the first three years of their establishment by making some fatal mistakes. However, it is a business nature to make mistakes, particularly for those young entrepreneurs who enter the market without proper preparation because they usually do not realize the constraints and problems faced by new ventures. Since the Lecturer of this course strongly believes that it is difficult to repeat a â€˜success modelâ€™, this course will concentrate on teaching the â€˜failure factorsâ€™ that can bring down new ventures. It emphasizes on several major topics related to executing a business opportunity and securing required financial resources. As the lack of financial resources is one of key failure factors and there are limited financial resources available to start-ups, students will be trained specifically for their fundraising skills. Since the investment community of Asia operates differently compared to the West, particularly USA, this course will concentrate on the assessment criteria of Asian investors in terms of the development and investment viability of ventures. This course covers critical issues concerning business ventures, especially ventures with innovative ideas and technology focuses, in detail. This course is highly practical in nature. Existing quality ventures that encounter problems in fundraising will be sourced through the Pan Asia Venture Development Platform (http://pavd.info/) globally. The students are required to review the business model of those ventures and modify them from the view of Asian investors: angels, venture capitalists, private equity investors â€“ industrial players and other strategic investors. At the last day of the course, students will make a fundraising presentation to approximately 15 - 30 PAVD investors from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan (http://pavd.info/Registered%20Investors/Judges/). The students may also see the performance of students from other programs and/or universities. In a nutshell, students of this course will work on real project and raise real money.",

In those situations, students may be interested in pursuing independent work for academic credit with the guidance and permission of a faculty member and the MBA Programme Office. Students can use this study option to customize their educational experience, adding another benefit of curricular flexibility.This course is designed to allow students to pursue academic topics in greater depth than the coverage of the topic in a class. The project, which may vary by topic and student, normally involves formal, academic study resulting in a substantial, written paper as the final product. The study can be either academic-based, research-driven or application-oriented.",
