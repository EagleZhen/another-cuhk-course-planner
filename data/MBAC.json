      "description": "This course provides an opportunity for the MBA students to apply what they have learned in the classroom to solving real-world business problems. A minimum of three and a maximum of five students are required to form a project team, under the supervision of a BA faculty member. A project proposal outlining the work to be undertaken by the project team must be approved by the supervising faculty member and endorsed by the Director of MBA Programmes or his/her representative within 10 calendar days from the start of the term. The project must be sponsored by a company in Hong Kong and approved by the Director. The sponsorship includes joint supervision of the project by an appointed senior staff of the company, pledge of assistance and support to ensure the successful completion of the project, and possible remuneration to members of the project team, other than the supervising faculty member, for the work undertaken. Students are expected to spend, on the average, one day a week throughout the duration of the project. The project duration must cover the term time as published by the University calendar, but should not exceed four months in duration. A final report of the project to be submitted to the supervising faculty member and an oral presentation of the results to the management of the sponsor is part of the requirements of the course. The final grades of the students will be determined by the supervising faculty member, in which the evaluation of the project by the sponsoring body should be reflected.",

      "description": "Most of the young ventures fail within the first three years of their establishment by making some fatal mistakes. However, it is a business nature to make mistakes, particularly for those young entrepreneurs who enter the market without proper preparation because they usually do not realize the constraints and problems faced by new ventures. Since the Lecturer of this course strongly believes that it is difficult to repeat a ‘success model’, this course will concentrate on teaching the ‘failure factors’ that can bring down new ventures. It emphasizes on several major topics related to executing a business opportunity and securing required financial resources.\n\nAs the lack of financial resources is one of key failure factors and there are limited financial resources available to start-ups, students will be trained specifically for their fundraising skills. Since the investment community of Asia operates differently compared to the West, particularly USA, this course will concentrate on the assessment criteria of Asian investors in terms of the development and investment viability of ventures. This course covers critical issues concerning business ventures, especially ventures with innovative ideas and technology focuses, in detail.\n\nThis course is highly practical in nature. Existing quality ventures that encounter problems in fundraising will be sourced through the Pan Asia Venture Development Platform (http://pavd.info/) globally. The students are required to review the business model of those ventures and modify them from the view of Asian investors: angels, venture capitalists, private equity investors – industrial players and other strategic investors. At the last day of the course, students will make a fundraising presentation to approximately 15 - 30 PAVD investors from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan (http://pavd.info/Registered%20Investors/Judges/). The students may also see the performance of students from other programs and/or universities. In a nutshell, students of this course will work on real project and raise real money.",
