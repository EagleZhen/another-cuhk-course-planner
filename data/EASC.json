Marine geology is distinct from that of continent and is the important foundation to launch Plate Tectonics, the modern unified theory of the Earth. In this course, major components of marine geological settings such as mid-ocean ridges, transform faults, subduction zones, oceanic lithosphere, and etc. will be introduced and discussed in details. Methods of geophysical survey will also be introduced. Field experiments of scientific instruments such as Ocean Bottom Seismometers, marine magnetometer and gravimeter will be conducted. A geological field trip will also be included. This course will be jointly offered with Ocean College, Zhejiang University, as an initiative to develop ocean sciences at CUHK.",

Geodynamics is going to answer those questions through observations and models of the large-scale behaviors of the solid Earth. The goal of the course is to develop a thorough understanding of physical processes, such as lithospheric deformation, heat transfer, and mantle flow. Lectures, paper discussions, and tutorials will help you to understand the principle of geodynamics, learn how to develop simple but useful models, and explain how the Earth evolves.",

      "description": "This course introduces the basic principles of atmospheric modeling and provides hands-on practice to perform numerical simulations on University computing cluster. It begins with the concept of model and reviewing of physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere. After that, this course will cover introduction and hands-on practice of the three basic processes in atmospheric simulation: pre-processing data, modeling, and post-processing data. The pre-processing process refers to the preparation of data from various sources by different techniques such as the generation of emission inventories for atmospheric chemistry modeling. It then introduces numerical modeling basics such as “model equations and numerical approaches”. For post-processing, this course offers different skills in visualization of the model output and evaluation of model output against real-world observations. This course also introduces advanced knowledge in “model coupling” and “inverse modeling”. Finally, this course provides hands-on practice on simple model development experiments. During the course, we will cover basic Linux environment commands to perform the main tasks mentioned above. Overall, students can anticipate grasping basic modeling concepts and skills from this course, which are of great value to their future careers in both academia and industry.",
