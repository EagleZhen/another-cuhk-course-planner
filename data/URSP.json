It is a significant development strategy proposed by the Chinese Government spanning approximately 60 countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, with a total population of 4.4 billion. This initiative takes advantage of global transportation routes, core cities, and key ports to build international economic co-operation corridors. The effective operation and management of the BRI require collaboration among a broad range of disciplines comprising civil engineering, material science, government operations, economics and finance, social and political science, and environmental science. A critical and multi-disciplinary understanding of the BRI can provide insights into basic requirements, geopolitical impact, physical barriers, and sustainability potential of the infrastructural projects it proposes to undertake and help relevant stakeholders address large-scale and complex challenges in the lifecycle management of those infrastructure projects. This course involves forward-looking perspectives to assess, predict, influence and enhance the in/direct network effects and benefits of the BRI on the cities, urban systems and peoples of the Belt and Road region.",

Contemporary cities are as much spaces of resonance, innovation, and emancipation as sites of violence, pollution, and alienation. This course revolves around the distinctive rhythms, experiences, and dynamics of urban life. What gives urban living its distinct characteristics? What current social, economic, and political problems deserve the attention of urban inhabitants? Which issues generate the greatest discord and motivate full coordination among different actors involved in governing cities?\n\nAs urban life is characterized by both cosmopolitan conviviality and immense inequality, in this course students will learn about different modes of coexistence and exclusion in contemporary cities. Globalizing forms of urban protest arising from struggles over urban resources, space, and decision-making mechanisms will be investigated. By highlighting the complex and contested dynamics of urban life, the course will help students situate and interpret their everyday urban experiences at the intersection of multiple and interconnected flows, networks, and scales that are produced by the city and that produce it.",

      "description": "Cities are dynamic sites of cultural production, interaction and transformation. Everyday experience of urban areas is characterized by specific social relations, spatial configurations and temporalities, while cities are home to various cultures emerging from multiple axes of difference. This course aims to introduce students to various ways in which urban life shapes and is shaped by cultural processes, institutions and practices. Students will learn about distinct urban senses, experiences and subjectivities only found in modern cities. We will explore how various cultural identities are (re)produced and negotiated by groups with different ethnic, religious and class backgrounds. To this end, we will look at the relationship between cultural background and inequality, segregation and domination. Students will further discover the ways in which cultural difference is implicated in symbolic economies of cities through urban regeneration and heritage conservation projects, city branding, and geographies of consumption.",

These citizen-artists committed to shoulder responsibilities beyond the object of art, emancipating art's subjects and its transformative agencies to empower the public at large in relational gestures through city games, community theatres, silent university, urban interventions, environmental activism and digital-placemaking …etc. This course will introduce students to a few key concepts in the field of socially engaged art practices. They will learn how to plan relational art projects in collaboration with a community they wish to engage. By applying art's transformative capacities to heal the pain points manifested in the public arena interdependently, students will be exposed to new methodologies to experiment with cultural production, empathize with different stakeholders’ conflicting interests and co-create imaginative outcome through the process of art-making.",

It stresses that engaging urban issues ‘out there’ is more than a complementary tool of collecting data, but also a reflexive practice that enables affective learning, changing our preconceptions, inspiring us to consider possible interventions. Selected tours covering cutting-edge urban development issues in town are provided to demonstrate the diverse functions of field-based learning in different urban milieu. It will examine the changing concepts of the ‘field’ in future city, and how we can represent urban problems by organizing a framework of destinations and experience.",

World renowned urban planning and architectural firms have located offices in China to take advantage of the abundance of Projects. Along with the Local Design Institutes, they design and implement various levels of planning and design and practices, which not only change the appearance of the cityscape, but also enrich the contents of our planning profession. Hong Kong’s status as an important core city in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) necessitates our urban planning students to systematically understand the urban planning practices in mainland China. A knowledge of the correlation of urban planning between Hong Kong and mainland China will be essential for Hong Kong to take advantage of the opportunities of GBA in the years ahead.",

      "description": "Urbanisation has changed the natural landscape into human habitats, shaping people’s daily lives and their modes of interactions. Technological developments have allowed the human race to ‘overcome’ many environmental constraints and gradually people have developed their urban settlements for functional purposes, forgetting the important relationships between forms and people’s sense of well-being. The popularization of smartphones, internet and social media further disconnected people from experiencing a place fully. What are urban forms? How do urban forms affect our sense of a place? How is our sense of place related to our subjective sense of multi-faceted well-being? This course aims to equip students with an ability to understand and study the relationships of urban forms, sense of place and sense of well-being so that they can (re)create urban forms that are conducive to community sense of place and multi-faceted well-being.\n\nThrough interactive class activities, the design and conduct of a team survey and individual essay writing, students learn not only about the importance of urban forms in shaping people’s sense of place and community and the multifaceted well-being, but also how to design a questionnaire survey to research and analyse their relationships and formulate suggestions to enhance the situation of local neighbourhoods.",

      "description": "Urban regeneration is important for most developed cities including Hong Kong given the lack of developable land in urban area. Urban regeneration offers some unique opportunities for the re-planning of some developed space for a better environment, where architectural conservation, landscape improvement, and better urban design can be implemented. However, owing to the many stakeholders, economic reasons and the diversified concerns, the process is also creating major debates in the community.\n\nBesides the deliberation on the theoretical concepts, the course will go through the technical process of urban regeneration which includes land use planning, architectural conservation, landscape and environmental improvement and urban design. This will enable students to understand the mechanism of urban transformation process thoroughly and may inspire them to further their studies in specific professional fields.\n\nOn the social side, redevelopment as a major tool of urban regeneration often disturbs and uproots existing residents, small local businesses and their social networks. Together with the issue of compensation this has been causing major public concerns. The issues are further complicated by the recent debate on the social responsibilities and economic sustainability of the Urban Renewal Authority.\n\nThis course aims not only at letting students understand the process of urban regeneration but their ability to analyze and assess the issues objectively and critically.",

Students are encouraged to compare and contrast various planning theories and their implications for the possible value positions and practical actions by the government, the market and the civil society groups in the planning process. They are expected to apply the theoretical perspectives to analyse and evaluate existing planning practices and suggest ways to improve them.",
