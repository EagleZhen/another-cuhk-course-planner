They comprise an indispensable part of the school curriculum and often a significant part of students’ memories of school life. As the Hong Kong school curriculum reforms, greater significance is focused on extra-curricular, academic, cross-curricular, integrated curricular and life-wide learning activities. Organizing student activities is an integral duty of educators nowadays, and it is a pre-requisite that they know how to design and implement student activities that are both safe and meaningful. This course aims to equip students with knowledge and skills required in design and implementation of student activities. The ultimate goal is to enhance both the processes and outcomes of student activities in the school curriculum and meet educational expectations on student learning through activities. Another aim is to heighten students’ awareness of safety and insurance issues in risk assessment through class activities.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

Among other important considerations, students are asked whether teachers should teacher their own values in the classroom, and whether this is indeed inevitable. Taking education as a means aiming at nurturing human qualities for the sake of personal and social well-being, the course examines a range of values such as truth, beauty, goodness and sageness/ saintliness as embodied in ‘whole-person education’. The course holds that education is unavoidably value-laden and that moral values form an important core of the aims of schooling. During the course students will discuss the nature of morality and a number of important approaches to moral education, and then compare these to other types of values education. Students will also be asked to reflect upon how they understand their own personal and professional development in relation to values and moral education and how to enact their various roles in the school.” Topics included please see the lecture outline.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

      "description": "The school context in Hong Kong has become increasingly complicated. The social and policy environment after 1997 is exerting a great impact on education. Part of this impact is that teachers risk facing litigations or their rights being evaded if they are not careful and guarded enough in their daily school lives. In order to reduce these risks, this module will introduce some of the most significant legal issues that arise in primary and secondary schools and their implications for teachers. The module will: i) explore evolving legal standards on a variety of issues including employment, school safety, student discipline, student well-being, infringement of copyright, free speech, services for students with special education needs and non-Chinese learners, sexual harassment, and violence and bullying; ii) examine educational, political, ethical, and administrative questions that legal issues often generate; iii) draw on real cases and legal/policy dilemmas that teachers are facing; and iv) provide teachers with knowledge and skills they need to make sound decisions, advance important educational objectives, and minimize legal problems.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

Shifting expectations require teachers to have a firm understanding of how schools operate and how reforms affect their roles both in and outside of the classroom. To effectively reshape their work in line with growing expectations teachers must commit to career long professional development and consider strategies for maximizing their effectiveness, especially in terms of learning and teaching. This course is designed to help teachers to understand and shape their roles in a reform environment. In other words it aims to help teachers to become leaders of their own professionalism. It does this in two ways, first it helps teachers understand life in schools undergoing reform and the effect this can have on their professional life. Topics covered in this area include organizational culture, micropolitics, organizational behaviour and teacher leadership. The second thrust aims to nurture teacher awareness of their own professional growth and how they can maximize the latest opportunities available in this area. Topics covered in this area include models of teacher development, stages of professional development, mentorship and internship, teacher appraisal and teacher professionalism.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

      "description": "This course employs a cross-disciplinary perspective to introduce important issues in supporting students with special educational needs (SEN) in integrated school settings. First, we examine the history, policy and principles of special education and integration in Hong Kong. We then discuss basic principles of identification and intervention for students with SEN with practical skills and examples. Curriculum and instructional issues will be deliberated. In particular, the types of SEN covered are Specific Learning Difficulties (SpLD), Intellectual Disability (ID), Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD), Physical Disability (PD), Visual Impairment (VI), Hearing Impairment (HI), Language Impairment (LI), Non-Chinese Speaking (NCS) and Mental Illness (MI), twice exceptional (i.e. SEN with Giftedness and Talents) will be covered. Developmental characteristics and needs of these students in primary school years will be addressed, with a focus on enhancing teachers’ professional capacity in supporting them in the regular classroom and in whole school.",
