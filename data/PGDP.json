      "description": "Contrary to common belief, student activities are not “supplementary” to school curriculum. They comprise an indispensable part of the school curriculum and often a significant part of students’ memories of school life. As the Hong Kong school curriculum reforms, greater significance is focused on extra-curricular, academic, cross-curricular, integrated curricular and life-wide learning activities. Organizing student activities is an integral duty of educators nowadays, and it is a pre-requisite that they know how to design and implement student activities that are both safe and meaningful. This course aims to equip students with knowledge and skills required in design and implementation of student activities. The ultimate goal is to enhance both the processes and outcomes of student activities in the school curriculum and meet educational expectations on student learning through activities. Another aim is to heighten students’ awareness of safety and insurance issues in risk assessment through class activities.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

With a brief historical background, the empirical analysis of policies will begin with the 1982 Llewellyn Report and then extend to other educational policy papers and reports. Topics for analysis may include: (1) the school system and the curriculum; (2) allocation, selection and examination; (3) technical and vocational education; (4) quality in school, (5) gender and class differentials in education; and (6) teacher education and qualification.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

An emphasis is placed on the investigation of major reform issues in the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan, and includes reference to the developmental experiences of Macau. These issues are also of major interest to educational reformers in Hong Kong. The course will include the following topics: (1) the pursuit of quality education; (2) curriculum reform and curriculum integration; (3) reform in teaching and teacher professionalism; (4) decentralization and school-based management; and (5) the expansion of higher education. By drawing insights from the reforms within and across societal contexts, the course aims to discern implications for the general reform movement as well as teaching and learning in Hong Kong.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

Among other important considerations, students are asked whether teachers should teacher their own values in the classroom, and whether this is indeed inevitable. Taking education as a means aiming at nurturing human qualities for the sake of personal and social well-being, the course examines a range of values such as truth, beauty, goodness and sageness/ saintliness as embodied in ‘whole-person education’. The course holds that education is unavoidably value-laden and that moral values form an important core of the aims of schooling. During the course students will discuss the nature of morality and a number of important approaches to moral education, and then compare these to other types of values education. Students will also be asked to reflect upon how they understand their own personal and professional development in relation to values and moral education and how to enact their various roles in the school.” Topics included please see the lecture outline.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

      "description": "The school context in Hong Kong has become increasingly complicated. The social and policy environment after 1997 is exerting a great impact on education. Part of this impact is that teachers risk facing litigations or their rights being evaded if they are not careful and guarded enough in their daily school lives. In order to reduce these risks, this module will introduce some of the most significant legal issues that arise in primary and secondary schools and their implications for teachers. The module will: i) explore evolving legal standards on a variety of issues including employment, school safety, student discipline, student well-being, infringement of copyright, free speech, services for students with special education needs and non-Chinese learners, sexual harassment, and violence and bullying; ii) examine educational, political, ethical, and administrative questions that legal issues often generate; iii) draw on real cases and legal/policy dilemmas that teachers are facing; and iv) provide teachers with knowledge and skills they need to make sound decisions, advance important educational objectives, and minimize legal problems.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

Shifting expectations require teachers to have a firm understanding of how schools operate and how reforms affect their roles both in and outside of the classroom. To effectively reshape their work in line with growing expectations teachers must commit to career long professional development and consider strategies for maximizing their effectiveness, especially in terms of learning and teaching. This course is designed to help teachers to understand and shape their roles in a reform environment. In other words it aims to help teachers to become leaders of their own professionalism. It does this in two ways, first it helps teachers understand life in schools undergoing reform and the effect this can have on their professional life. Topics covered in this area include organizational culture, micropolitics, organizational behaviour and teacher leadership. The second thrust aims to nurture teacher awareness of their own professional growth and how they can maximize the latest opportunities available in this area. Topics covered in this area include models of teacher development, stages of professional development, mentorship and internship, teacher appraisal and teacher professionalism.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

These have created considerable stress for teachers and administrators. This course is designed to help learners to understand the symptoms as well as the social causes of school violence and behaviors of at-risk students; and to develop whole school strategies for handling them. The course encompasses a series of authentic and virtual cases that reflect different types of student disciplinary and severe behavioral problems that occur within the school. Learners will be challenged to handle or resolve these cases from a multi-disciplinary approach and in ways that maintain inclusive and productive learning environments.
