      "description": "This course aims to provide students with knowledge, skills and applications of collaborative governance in a rapidly changing globalized world. Collaborative governance is broadly defined as the processes and structures of public policy decision making and management that engage people constructively across the boundaries of public, private and civic society for a public purpose that could not otherwise be accomplished. With the increasingly limited role of government in governance, the ability of policymakers to collaborate with non-state actors across levels and boundaries becomes critical for addressing policy challenges. The course focuses on how collaborative governance can build consensus and deliberative purposes of public policy and governance through studying its formats, process, rationales, concepts and outcomes as well as evaluation of its effectiveness and dilemma. The course also intends to nurture students to have a responsible and reflective role in society and to pursue a better governance.",

Advance in data science radically transforms the way data can be handled and utilized, and inevitably generates new regulatory concerns and debates due to the clash of competing values and interests. For example, while privacy and citizen rights advocates strive to decrease unexpected uses of data, many scientists and institutions may attempt to use data to design and evaluate public policies in order to maximize its effectiveness. This course discusses theoretical approaches to regulations from multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches for the analysis of regulatory institutions, practices and ideas in data regulation as well as the dillemma between utilization of data and its protection, accessibility and transparency.",

Students will be given opportunities to observe and experience the management operations and to have hands-on experience in public sector, non-government organizations (NGOs), private sector etc., and to experience the work life in the sector, as well as to nurture students’ practical skills. It is recommended that the internship to be conducted in summer holiday, i.e. June to August, after finishing year two studies in the block mode (i.e. 5 days x 8 hours). DSPS Programme will deploy work units, agencies, or organizations that provide internships relevant to the general course objectives. Meanwhile, students are encouraged to explore opportunities of internship to fit their own specific learning needs. However, all self-selected internship must comply with the course requirements, and subjected to the approval of DSPS Programme Director. Guidance and assistance will be provided whenever appropriate.During the internship, each student would be guided and assisted by an academic supervisor. The supervisor offers advice and help whenever necessary during the attachment period. At the same time, each student will be receiving guidance and assistance from his/her agency supervisor. Students will submit self-evaluation report to reflect on the experience in the internship. Academic advice will be provided to help students consolidate their learning in the internship.",

It offers students the opportunity to conduct a project on a selected topic under supervision related to data science and policy studies. While students are expected to integrate and apply what they have learned in the courses, internship, overseas exchanges and other learning opportunities, they are expected to address a real-world issue and to formulate feasible solutions and/or policy recommendations for the issue. Students are expected to meet their supervisor regularly, present their findings and exhibit their final product in any formats after developing a mutual consent between students and supervisor.",
