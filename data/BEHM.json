Students will form groups to critically analyze selected companies or policies on healthcare and/or environmental sustainability so that they will be motivated by how these companies, policies, or management strategies are running and their significance in contributing to society. Students will apply knowledge and techniques learned from courses of the relevant concentration areas and conduct a deeper study into specific topics of their interests in biotechnology, entrepreneurship and/or healthcare management. Students and instructors will conduct progress meetings on a regular basis. Students are expected to give oral presentations and submit their reports at the end of the course.",

After critically evaluating the companies or policies investigated in Capstone Project I, students should ideate and design a prototype based on the recommendations they developed for optimizing these business practices, improving operational efficiency, and fostering sustainable development. Students are encouraged to test and improve their prototypes, establish their start-ups or NGOs wherever practicable to foster entrepreneurial skills, and provide them with practical experience in developing and implementing strategies, through applying their knowledge and skills acquired from the previous coursework and employing innovative thinking to address real-world challenges. Guidance will be provided by the instructor and regular consultations will ensure the alignment of project objectives. By the end of this course, students will present their proposals through comprehensive oral presentations and provide detailed portfolios, demonstrating their ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios and contribute meaningfully to biotechnology or healthcare management.",
