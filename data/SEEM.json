This course aims to help navigate students in taking more advanced courses in its parent disciplines to build up their expertise in data science. We cover topics including:\nHistory and impact of Data Science.\nCollecting Data: sources, types and categorization of data.\nVisualising Data: summary statistics, data display, data dictionaries, schema and graphical visualization.\nAnalysing Data: pattern recognition, correlations and relationships, hypotheses testing, statistical significance.\nInvestigating Data: data mining, machine learning, inference, meta-data, modeling, eliciting meaning and validation.\nApplicational contexts: Examples of useful applications from case studies.",

Next, we cover different models like the external memory model (for I/O algorithms), the MPC model (for distributed algorithms), the work-depth model (for shared-memory parallel algorithms), and the corresponding algorithms fitted to such modeling.

The course will provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts and techniques behind GenAI, including generative models, probabilistic models, deep learning architectures, and self-supervised/unsupervised learning, etc. The advanced topics of large language models, conversational AI and mutli-modality generative AI will be further explored. Applications on speech and conversational data will be introduced to illustrate the concepts and techniques of GenAI. The ethical and social implications of GenAI will also be discussed in the course, so that students can critically analyze the impact of GenAI on society and propose ethical guidelines for its development and deployment. Ample opportunities will be provided to students to apply what they have learned in class through hands-on implementation and research paper on course projects. The course is suitable for students who have some background in machine learning, probability, statistics, and linear algebra.",

We build on fundamentals including signal processing, linguistics, information theory and machine learning. We introduce component technologies including automatic speech recognition, natural language understanding, dialog modeling, knowledge graph search, natural language generation, as well as text-to-speech synthesis. These technologies can be integrated into a diversity of systems, e.g. the ubiquitous chatbot systems, speech/text mining/retrieval/summarization systems, language learning systems, etc.",

Accordingly, the course includes two parts: company visits and project work with optional topics. For the company visit activities, students are organized to visit different kinds of companies and enterprises, such as bank, logistics company, insurance carrier, airline, retailer company, and government organizations, to help them understand different business operating environments and their approaches for solution development. For the project work part, under the supervision of the course instructor, students in groups will carry out a practical project in Systems Engineering & Engineering Management, by building models on practical problems, performing quantitative analysis and making decisions.",

To qualify for the award of the subject credits, the student must attach to a company in Systems Engineering and Engineering Management related post as approved by the Professor-in-Charge for no less than 12 weeks. The student will have an academic supervisor as assigned by the Professor-in-Charge and an industry supervisor from the company. There will be a mid-term company visit by the academic supervisor. At the end of the internship, the student must give a presentation to the academic and industry supervisors, and submit a report summarizing what the student has done and learnt from the internship. The student's grade will be determined by (1) the presentation, (2) the student report and (3) a testimonial from the industry supervisor.\n\nThe internship should normally take place in the summer term after a student has finished the first two semesters of studies. Part-time students can decide to undertake the internship in the summer term of either the first or second year of studies.\n\nStudents are recommended to seek the Professor-in-Charge's comment on potential internship opportunities before enrolling in the course.",
