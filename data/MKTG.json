      "description": "We are all consumers. As consumers, we make decisions every day, from the trivial to the fundamental. Psychologists and behavioral scientists in the related fields have studied how people process information and make decisions individually and in a group. This course is devoted to understanding how a consumer decides and judges in daily consumption contexts. Topics to cover include mental blocks and fixations, decision heuristics, behavioral nudge, motivated reasoning, affective influences, group decision making, etc.. This course will help the students discover a series of serious yet often overlooked mistakes that most consumers would commit in various consumption contexts. At the same time, this course will also teach students how to correct these mistakes and how to utilize such knowledge in crafting marketing tactics (e.g., pricing, advertising) to influence consumers’ choice and behavior.",

      "description": "Customer analytics is a process by which businesses leverage customer data to make key marketing decisions. It has a precursor as the so-called process of customer relationship management (CRM). Historically, only repeated customer interactions—mainly in retail, service and industrial sectors—generate sizable data suitable for business analytics, and these data are stored in the CRM system. Today’s market sees proliferation of customer data for not just loyal customers but even first-time or short-lived visitors, on not only customer transaction histories but also their characteristics, attitudes, opinions, and behaviors. Thanks to the advancement of ready-to-use data analytics tools, businesses can easily tap into this rich information to understand their customers’ likes, needs, and wants better than ever before. If customers are the ultimate trophy that businesses are battling for in the market, customer analytics is the most powerful weapon a business need to master to outsmart one’s competitors.\nThis course aims to provide students with the principles, frameworks as well as tools to make sense of customer data for business decision making. Our philosophy is to view customer data as assets of the business and the goal is to use right tools to uncover the relevant insights to acquire new customers, grow existing customers’ loyalty, and ultimately, improve all customers’ lifetime value to the business. In this course, we will ask the following questions:\n• How to allocate marketing resources to acquire new customers?\n• How to engage customers for their continued retention and relationship development?\n• How to utilize effective data analytics tools to generate actionable customer insights?\nWe will then connect relevant findings to established strategies and tactics to develop and grow customer lifetime value.",

This general framework emphasizes the design, implementation, and analysis of strategic initiatives in customer analytics, including identifying good prospects and customer acquisition; relationship development through up-selling, cross-selling, personalization, and loyalty programs; customer attrition, retention and win-back. The course also exposes students to analytical “know-hows” — the advantages, limitations, common uses, and best practice — of data-driven tools and quantitative analysis methods, including casual inference, panel data analysis, machine learning, A/B testing and statistical modeling. The principal objectives of the course are:\n\n* To provide a solid foundation in customer-centric marketing;\n* To develop fluency and understanding of modern customer metrics and data-driven methods;\n* To design and analyze CRM strategies to optimize marketing initiatives and improve firm profitability.",

      "description": "One of the most important assets of any business is tangible: its brands. As industries become increasingly competitive, it is clear that strong brand-building skills are needed to survive and prosper. The Strategic Brand Management course is designed to provide conceptual background as well as practical approaches (i.e., relevant research techniques) to manage brands as a strategic asset as well as a primary source of competitive advantage. Topics include new product development process, brand creation, brand building, measuring/monitoring brand equity, and revitalizing brands. Although brands are one of the most important assets for any business, it is found that managers generally do not have very clear idea how to successfully manage their brands. Far too few managers really understand the concept of brand equity and how it must be implemented. In other words, managers need to learn the basic brand building concepts as well as the research techniques that can be used to collect data for brand planning. The objective of this course is to provide students with understanding regarding brand building concepts as well as to equip students with research techniques that can be used to build and manage a successful brand.",

First, students will be exposed to different negotiation theories (the science). Using these theories as guides, we will then discuss how to come up with useful negotiation strategies and tactics. Second, students will develop and sharpen negotiation skill by actually negotiating with other students in realistic settings (the art).\n\nThis course is designed to complement the skills learned in other courses at CUHK. A basic premise of the course is that analytical skills are vital to discovery of optimal solutions to problems and that business people need a broad array of negotiation skills to get those solutions accepted and implemented. The course will allow students the opportunity to develop those negotiation skills through direct experience and to understand negotiation in useful analytic frameworks.",
      "course_syllabus": "The course will build cumulatively from (seemingly) simple negotiations to those of greater complexity. Structured negotiation exercises are used to isolate and emphasize specific analytic points and essential skills. Cases and readings should help you integrate the analysis and develop intuition about related, possibly more personally relevant situations. We will cover the following topics:\n\nDistributive Negotiation (Value Claiming)\n\nWe begin by focusing on situations in which each party attempts to enlarge his or her share of what is taken to be a fixed pie. We will introduce basic concepts and tactics, with a special emphasis on the cognitive aspects of negotiation.\n\nMultiple Parties/Multiple Issues\n\nIn the classes that follow, we study multiparty negotiations and explore how the dynamics of these negotiations differ from two party settings. In addition to dealing with multiple issues, we examine the strategic and tactical issues that are essential to any sophisticated building (or destroying) of coalitions.\n\nIntegrative Negotiation (Value Creating)\n\nWe will put it all together by exploring negotiations that contain elements of both cooperation and competition; that is, cases where the parties can “enlarge the pie” by creating joint gains. We identify the potential sources of joint gains – and why they are often not fully captured. We also analyze the tension between cooperative moves to create value and competitive moves to claim it. This tension is fundamental to negotiation and affects virtually every tactical and strategic choice.",

      "description": "Making decisions, from the trivial to the fundamental, is part of the everyday life of every manager and investor. For the last 30 years, psychologists — and more recently also economists — have studied how people process information and make decisions. This research program has provided an insightful understanding of how people’s decisions deviate from “optimal” ones, and the consequences of such biases in financial and personal terms. This course is devoted to understanding the nature, causes and managerial implications of these limitations. It will help the students discover a series of serious yet often overlooked mistakes that most people would commit in a variety of decision contexts, including investment decisions, hiring decisions, purchase decisions and even marital decisions. At the same time, this course will also teach them how to correct these mistakes and how to reach optimal solutions. Instead of overwhelming the students with mathematic models or academic theories, this course will use many in-class exercises and questionnaires to convey the concepts.",
