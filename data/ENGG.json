Demonstrations on solving real-life problems creatively will be provided. Case studies in social media usage will be included to illustrate how to interpret data properly and identify false information.

Demonstrations on solving real-life problems creatively will be provided. Case studies in social media usage will be included to illustrate how to interpret data properly and identify false information.

Students will work in small groups on a practical project in which they will apply the design methodology introduced to them in lectures in a design project. The project work will involve defining milestones, identifying the constraints and requirements, defining the requirement specifications of the design, making and evaluating different possible designs by carrying out experiments to obtain data for refining the design, prototyping of the final design and testing of the system built in the project.",

Topics include convex analysis, linear and conic linear programming, nonlinear programming, optimality conditions, Lagrangian duality theory, and basics of optimization algorithms. Applications from different fields, such as computational economics and finance, combinatorial optimization, and signal and image processing, will be used to complement the theoretical developments. No prior optimization background is required for this class. However, students should have a workable knowledge in multivariable calculus, basic concepts of analysis, linear algebra and matrix theory.",
