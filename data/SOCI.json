      "description": "From the “borrowed time and borrowed place”, Hong Kong has evolved into a global city with its own identity. Since the 1950s, the city experienced an economic miracle, withstood numerous financial crises, and is in the process of economic restructuring. Politically, it has turned from “the last Colony” of Great Britain into a Special Administrative Region of the PRC. Culturally, the flourishing Canto pop-culture coincides with the emergence of a local identity. Using a sociological perspective, this course critically reflects on the impact of these profound changes on the construction of the so-called ‘Hong Kong identity’. Who is a HongKongese? This seemingly simple question underlies critical issues and boundaries about nationality, ethnicity, language, culture, class, and citizenship. The construction of a Hong Kong identity necessitates the drawing of boundaries that include and exclude, defines who is entitled to resources and power and who is not, and projects differential expectations of rights and responsibilities on insiders and outsiders. The question thus has profound impacts on how resources and power are distributed in society, and affects the life chances of individuals, families and society.(Advisory: Not for Sociology Majors.)",

These are real choices for some people but irrelevant questions for many. Do we have freedom to lead a life of our own or has society already chosen the path of life for each of us? These are issues either taken for granted or deliberately avoided in our everyday life. In this course, sociological theories will be introduced to analyse how social institutions in the modern world have affected the meaning and pattern of life. Students are encouraged to have a reflective mind so as to contemplate what life style, or at least what attitude, we can choose regarding these dimensions of life.",

      "description": "Sociology has always had an intimate relationship with cities. Urbanization — the increase of the share of the population living in cities — was one of the developments that early sociologists sought to study and explain. Since then, the global urban population has only continued to increase. Today, over half of humanity lives in cities and towns. Understanding urban society is no less essential than in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Urban sociology has many sides, but in this course, students will learn about four main topics: 1) Early theories and classic statements on urban life, 2) the distinctive social character of the “urban experience,” 3) making sense of urban space in capitalism through various theoretical perspectives, and 4) the “hardware and software” of urban cities, addressing issues such as affordable housing, gentrification, creative class and minorities in the city.",

Students will examine how these theorists addressed fundamental social issues and developed frameworks for analyzing social phenomena. The course emphasizes critical reading, analytical thinking, and understanding the historical context of sociological concepts. This course will explore the following questions: 1. What key themes and ideas emerge from classical sociological theory? 2. How does their social and intellectual context shape these ideas? 3. How can these theories inform our sociological way of questioning?",

The science of social networks focuses on measuring, modeling, and understanding the different ways that people are connected to one another. In this course, we will use a broad toolkit of theories and methods drawn from the social, natural, and mathematical sciences to learn what a social network is, to understand how to work with social network data, and to illustrate some of the ways that social networks can be useful in theory and in practice. This course is designed to provide students with the opportunity to (i) master the major concepts within the field of social networks, with a particular attention to social capital theory; (ii) critically examine the causes and consequences of social networks across a variety of behavioral contexts and academic domains; and (iii) achieve minimum competency in social network analysis.",

Here, students will learn not about theories of some specific sociological specialty, but instead contemporary sociological theories — period, full stop. What is offered by this course is an introduction to perspectives on society that link together the different facets of social life. These perspectives claim that the same insights can illuminate not just, say, education but also work and the family. They represent lens that can be used to view and understand these various social spheres, or they identify common trends that affect them. Students will gain from this course a deeper understanding of the most general questions asked by sociologists today, and which link together the more narrowly focused view of each individual study or subfield.We strongly encourage students to take SOCI3003 before taking this course.",

Case studies of police practices in both local and global contexts are critically evaluated to identify the social forces that shape the respective social control process.",

Video analysis has been used to study a large variety of activities, for example, how people greet each other, how families eat together, how people taste cheese before buying, how skateboarders take turns in pool skate sessions, how people pass through doors, how tourists use Google maps to navigate through a city, and so on. The course is hands-on. You will be taught how to make your own video-recordings, as well as how to transcribe and analyse your data. There will be frequent in-class activities and discussions, so you are expected to be prepared and ready to contribute. Through your engagement in the course, you will gain an appreciation of the importance of real-time, observable behaviours for the accomplishment and maintenance of social interaction. You will also develop your powers of observation, attention to detail, and analytical skills.",

      "description": "Health is a fundamental aspect of human existence and medicine is arguably the crown jewel of modern science. We all want good health, effective treatments of illness and affordable health care. Yet present-day health care is the flashpoint of many controversies: about the conflicts between patients and doctors; about the safety of medical treatments and reliability of medical knowledge; about inequality in health and longevity; and about the ever-increasing health care spending. This course dissects these issues from a sociological perspective. We ask questions such as: What counts as illness? How do people understand illness? How does illness affect people’s life? Who gets ill and why? What is the role of medical technology in fostering health? Why do doctors and patients have trouble communicating? How should health care systems be organized?",

Recognizing that environmental problems are often intricately connected with the conditions of societies that they are situated in, we will explore the processes underlying social and environmental changes as well as the consequences that those processes may entail at national, regional, and global levels. Substantive topics to be covered include limits of growth and development, sustainable production and consumption, climate change and global governance, and environmental movement. The course also aims to promote an awareness and understanding of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) framework put forward by the United Nations in 2015 so as to facilitate a broader discussion and reflection on how individuals and societies can work together and find solutions to those environmental challenges.",

      "description": "In the past decades, the world witnessed a sea change in the influence that scientific knowledge has in shaping the course of our economy and culture. From the development of iPhone to the Covid-19 vaccine, ours is a society organized around and even controlled by expert knowledge systems. Meanwhile, science itself also underwent increasingly fiercer attack by outsiders, a typical example being the disagreement on whether the climate change is real. Sociology of scientific knowledge offers us a set of tools to understanding and analyzing these heatedly debated big questions in society today. By critically analyzing science, scientists, and the system of knowledge production that they created and maintained, this course surveys major topics and recent developments in the social studies of science. The arrangement of these topics follows a micro-to-macro sequence: First, the course discusses personal level STEM experiences, such as STEM educational pipeline and STEM job market; then, the course discusses institutional and disciplinary level analysis of how science works and how innovations come about; lastly, the course moves on to society, national, and international level of the impact of science, using examples from the platform economy, the international politics and the global pandemic. By the end of the course, students will develop basic knowledge towards the Technology Facilitation Mechanism for supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, through critically examining the multistakeholder collaboration between scientific community, nation states and other stakeholders in the STI policy cycle.",

With a comparative perspective, this course focuses on how governments and law enforcement agencies in different societies intervene in the breaking of laws in a globalized world. The course begins by introducing various concepts of social control from a sociological standpoint. In addition to a review of the relevant criminological theories and empirical research findings, the course assesses the major impact of globalization on public security and explores the proliferation of transnational criminal activities in the process. Finally, the course will examine how social control agencies react and seek to address these problems in local and global context.",

      "description": "This course is a nontechnical introduction to the intellectual and methodological developments that undergird the exciting new era of social research using randomized experimental and quasi-experimental designs. Through in-depth case studies of exemplary empirical studies based on randomized experimental/quasi-experimental designs, the course will demonstrate how basic research could help understand human attitudes/perceptions/behaviors and provide evidence-based guidance for policymaking.This course is intended for students in their third or fourth year of college. The course coverage will be helpful to students who intend to pursue more advanced academic training, government sector jobs that place a premium on program evaluation and quantitative literacy, or service industry jobs that have witnessed a surging demand for big data applications. A one-term course on basic statistics is essential for understanding the technical but elementary terms used in this course. Still, math and statistical skills are not required to excel in this course.Specifically, the course is designed to achieve three learning objectives:1. To master the generalized experimental methodology by studying the core principles of experimental designs and some exemplary social science experimental studies. 2. To ask real-world questions that can be answered with randomized experiments (of various forms) to understand human perceptions/behaviors, induce behavioral changes, and inform evidence-based policymaking.3. To gain intuitive understanding of the counterfactual paradigm for causal thinking (i.e., using quasi-experimental designs) when truly randomized experiments are infeasible.Evaluation of learning progress and performance will closely align with the course objectives. The course assessments would emphasize the conceptual and empirical understandings of experimental designs and their real-world applications through a group project presentation and a short research proposal written by individuals. The primary language of instruction, teaching materials, and students’ written submissions will be in English.",

      "description": "Having access to adequate housing is a basic human right under Article 25 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Housing not only satisfies ontological needs but also plays a critical role in social stability and individual well-being. Decades later, housing problems in both local and overseas societies remain acute. However, we now have a better understanding of the social causes and consequences of these issues through years of empirical research and studies, hence with potential ways to achieve more sustainable housing. This course examines housing from a broad social science perspective while providing students with a solid foundation in the sociological understanding of housing. The course begins with a review of the literature, exploring the political economy of housing production and consumption. Key topics include: An examination of the various agents involved in the housing market, including tenants, landlords, urban planners, and developers. Reflections on the social construction of the meaning of housing and its implications for individuals and communities. A discussion on the financialization of the housing market and the unequal accessibility of mortgage credits, which shape life chances and create new forms of inequality in urban centers. The impact of living in substandard housing on health and psychological well-being. Issues of housing segregation along ethnic and racial lines, gentrification, displacement, and homelessness. The complex relationship between housing and welfare policy. Through this comprehensive examination, students will gain insights into the multifaceted nature of housing issues and the critical role of sociology in studying them.",

Conducted by faculty from the Sociology Programme, this course focuses on the exploration of social issues and cultural dynamics in various environments outside of Hong Kong.Students will engage with diverse communities, enhancing their understanding of social structures and cultural practices in different contexts. The course encourages students to conduct comparative studies across different societies, promoting critical thinking about sociological concepts and their application. Students will interact with local scholars/university students and/or community members, fostering cross-cultural dialogue and collaborative learning experiences. A study trip to a selected destination outside of Hong Kong will take place during term breaks, providing immersive experiences in the field. Students will be required to engage actively in all course activities, including lectures, workshops, and field studies. The assessment will include individual and group-based assignments, culminating in a reflective report that integrates their field experiences with sociological theories. By the end of the course, students will have developed practical skills in sociological research and analysis, enhancing their capacity to engage meaningfully with global social issues and contributing to their growth as informed global citizens.",

A secondary objective of the course is to introduce ‘unconventional’ data types in social science research, such as texts, social media and web data, and research strategies for analysis and visualization. The course emphasizes hands-on experiences with statistical software in data processing and analysis.",

Education-related topics covered in this course will include stratification and inequality, school, family, peers, community, rural-urban divide, migration, gender, technology, mental health, mass education, and elite formation, among others. Through studying these topics, we will also discuss how education is connected to individual, community, and national development, such as whether education reduces poverty and promotes social mobility. Readings will not be region-specific but topic-based, covering empirical evidence across the world and representing the typical research questions on a particular topic. By reading and discussing empirical studies throughout the course, students will learn how to discover and analyze the key sociological and practical issues of education both locally and internationally.",

Some contemporary sociologists therefore argued that we are in an age of ‘re-enchantment’ instead of ‘disenchanted’ modern society.The course will be divided in two parts. In the first part, we will start from Max Weber’s theory to see how sociologists conceived the relation between religion and modernity as well as their conflicts.

      "description": "Internship is a valuable educational experience that nurtures students’ competency for responding to challenges in the 21st Century. Integrating academic curriculum with supervised internship, this course provides students with the opportunity to make sense of real-life work experiences with the sociological imagination. Course seminars aim at two objectives: to advance students’ career preparedness with exposure to work, and to transform their sociological knowledge into sustainability skills that are essential for promoting organisational change for a sustainable future. Aside from gaining on-the-job skills, students will learn to apply sociological analysis to study their internship organisations in both private or public sectors. Utilizing critical thinking – a core feature of sociological training, students will identify and reflect on specific values, goals, workflow and structure, and social and environmental impacts of an organisation through their first-hand experiences in various professions. To successfully enrol this course, students must secure their local internship arrangement through obtaining approval from the field supervisor and the course instructor. Students must complete a minimum of 100 hours of supervised internship work aside from the regular course assignments and attending course seminars.",

We all want good health, effective treatments of illness and affordable health care. Yet present-day health care is the flashpoint of many controversies: about the reliability of medical knowledge; and about inequalities in health and longevity. This course dissects these issues from a sociological perspective. We ask questions such as: What counts as illness? How do people understand illness? How does illness affect people’s life? Who gets ill and why? What is the role of medical technology in fostering health? Why do doctors and patients have trouble communicating?This course surveys major approaches and areas in the sociological study of health, illness and medicine. The central idea is that we cannot understand the topics of health, illness and medicine simply by looking at the biological phenomena and medical knowledge, but instead, we must also consider a variety of social, political, economic, and cultural forces.",

      "description": "Although some theorists claim that ‘class is dead’ and thus fails to explain contemporary society, our daily life is still influenced by class factors, not only in terms of resource allocation but also in the ways we conduct our social life. In this course, we will explore how class shapes our lifestyles, housing, association patterns, life chances, education strategies, parent-child interaction, subjective identification and even political orientation. We do not simply take class as objective structural positions; we also perceive class as crucial social boundaries and distinctions that have to be practiced, performed and reproduced in various social fields. Such a perspective will help us to discover and reflect how our social life is ‘classed’.",

It is centered on the writings of Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, and Karl Marx, supplemented by other (and more recent) theoretical work. The readings and seminar discussions will cover three mains sets of issues: 1) the relationship between the individual and society; 2) the special challenges and problems confronting a science of society; and 3) theoretical accounts of key modern social structures. Secondarily, students will through a series of exercises leading up to a final paper gain practice in the essential skill of “reading and writing with theories.”The course grade will be based on a term paper, which will be assigned a letter grade according to following rubric:The “significant progress” mentioned in the rubric will be judged in reference to the writing exercises completed during the second half of the course but which will not be graded separately.",

      "description": "This is an intensive training course on the logic of theory construction and the logic of evidence building in empirical sociology. The theoretical and evidential logics provide the foundation for the effective use of qualitative and quantitative data analysis alike. The course will provide the tools for clarifying the theoretical and evidential logics of an empirical study and introduce three families of explanatory mechanisms that are relevant to diverse subfields of sociology. Most importantly, the course will develop the competence of students in theory construction and evidence building through learning-by-doing. Much of the course will be devoted to a re-examination of many exemplary works in empirical sociology from each theoretical family. The course will not focus on any philosophical debate or technique of data analysis.",

Discussion will emphasize both the statistical reasoning underlying these methods and their empirical applications. At the end of the course, students should have sufficient exposure to a wide range of analytical methods, helping them to appreciate the quantitative research literature and to conduct their own empirical analyses.",

The course is in a seminar format. Lectures will be interwoven with discussions.
