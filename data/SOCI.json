      "description": "From the “borrowed time and borrowed place”, Hong Kong has evolved into a global city with its own identity. Since the 1950s, the city experienced an economic miracle, withstood numerous financial crises, and is in the process of economic restructuring. Politically, it has turned from “the last Colony” of Great Britain into a Special Administrative Region of the PRC. Culturally, the flourishing Canto pop-culture coincides with the emergence of a local identity. Using a sociological perspective, this course critically reflects on the impact of these profound changes on the construction of the so-called ‘Hong Kong identity’. Who is a HongKongese? This seemingly simple question underlies critical issues and boundaries about nationality, ethnicity, language, culture, class, and citizenship. The construction of a Hong Kong identity necessitates the drawing of boundaries that include and exclude, defines who is entitled to resources and power and who is not, and projects differential expectations of rights and responsibilities on insiders and outsiders. The question thus has profound impacts on how resources and power are distributed in society, and affects the life chances of individuals, families and society.(Advisory: Not for Sociology Majors.)",

These are issues either taken for granted or deliberately avoided in our everyday life.

      "course_syllabus": "Overview:\nCurrent debates and discourse about Japan often point to the distinctive aspects of the social and cultural foundation of the country. The concern has been one that inclines to highlight the uniqueness of many of the country's internal attributes while ignoring the persistent dynamics inherent in Japan's involvement with the world. Hence, a proper approach to understanding Japan also requires our intellectual sensitivity to the interplay between local/national and global forces that shape the unique mode of development of the country. That is, we need to treat Japan not only as a \"cultural artefact\" but also as a social and political entity that finds its place in the world cultural evolution. The course attempts to fill this intellectual gap. By teaching Japan from a macro-sociological approach, the course seeks to address sociological inquiries and implications that are crucial to the understanding of some of the theoretical paradoxes of the Japanese society. Specifically, the course examines the social and cultural dynamics of Japanese society. Emphasis will be given to the sociological implications of Japanese social organization and national identity as productions of a historical and social relationship with her neighbouring countries and the world.\nSome Distinct Characteristics of this Course:\n· Adopting a sociological approach to understand and appreciate the social dynamics of institutional arrangements and changes in the Japanese society.\n· Focusing not only on Japan’s national attributes, but also on the extent of global impact on the country's development.\n· Use of tutorials to help students clarify concepts and theoretical perspectives. The tutorials will also facilitate students to work on their project assignments.\n· Use of audio-visual materials (magazines, films and video) to help students understand better the lectures and reading materials\nTopics Covered:\n· Cultural Explanations and their Problems: a sociological approach\n· Growing Up Modern in Japan: Socialization, Schooling and Education\n· Coming of Age in Japan: Youth and Youth Culture\n· Being an Adult Japanese: Social Responsibility, Work, and Marriage and Family\n· Japan in a Comparative and Global Perspective: Convergent and Divergent Theories of Globalization",

      "description": "Sociology has always had an intimate relationship with cities. Urbanization — the increase of the share of the population living in cities — was one of the developments that early sociologists sought to study and explain. Since then, the global urban population has only continued to increase. Today, over half of humanity lives in cities and towns. Understanding urban society is no less essential than in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Urban sociology has many sides, but in this course, students will learn about four main topics: 1) Early theories and classic statements on urban life, 2) the distinctive social character of the “urban experience,” 3) making sense of urban space in capitalism through various theoretical perspectives, and 4) the “hardware and software” of urban cities, addressing issues such as affordable housing, gentrification, creative class and minorities in the city.",

Special attention will be given to diversity of family forms, changing sex-role norms, class and childrearing practices, power and division of family labour, linkages between the family and the work systems. Whenever possible, family issues will be discussed and illustrated with examples in Chinese society.",

The nature of the conventional wisdom of the “youth problem” is critically examined, with the help of concepts and theories in sociology and related fields. By the end of the course, students are expected to gain more understanding of the nature of the phenomenon of problematization of youth, and to look beyond common sense or public perception on current social issues related to the youth in modern society. More importantly, youth problems can jeopardize the sustainable development of youth. A broader and deeper understanding of various facets of problematization can inform how youth should be empowered to attain sustainable development in modern society.",

Students are encouraged to critically think of and discuss about six categories of questions as below:\n(a) What are the major forms of stratification in human history? Is inequality an inevitable feature of human life?\n(b) How many social classes are there? What are the principal? \"fault lines\" or social cleavages that define the class structure? Are these cleavages strengthening or weakening with the transition to advanced industrialism?\n(c) How frequently do individuals cross occupational or class boundaries? Are educational degrees, social contacts, and \"individual luck\" important forces in matching individuals to jobs and class positions? What other social and institutional forces affect occupational attainment and allocation?\n(d) How are the lifestyles, attitudes, and personalities of individuals shaped by their class locations? Are there identifiable \"class cultures\" in past and present societies?\n(e) What types of social processes and state policies serve to maintain or alter racial, ethnic, and sex discrimination in labor markets? Have these forms of discrimination weakened or strengthened with the transition to advanced industrialism?\n(f) Will stratification systems take on new and distinctive forms in the future? Is a \"new class\" of professionals and intellectuals emerging?

      "description": "This course explores the foundational works of classical sociological theory through the writings of Émile Durkheim (French, 1858-1917), Karl Marx (German, 1818-1883), and Max Weber (German, 1864-1920). Students will examine how these theorists addressed fundamental social issues and developed frameworks for analyzing social phenomena. The course emphasizes critical reading, analytical thinking, and understanding the historical context of sociological concepts. This course will explore the following questions: 1. What key themes and ideas emerge from classical sociological theory? 2. How does their social and intellectual context shape these ideas? 3. How can these theories inform our sociological way of questioning?",

      "description": "Social networks affect many aspects of our lives, and their effect persists over the life course. The science of social networks focuses on measuring, modeling, and understanding the different ways that people are connected to one another. In this course, we will use a broad toolkit of theories and methods drawn from the social, natural, and mathematical sciences to learn what a social network is, to understand how to work with social network data, and to illustrate some of the ways that social networks can be useful in theory and in practice. This course is designed to provide students with the opportunity to (i) master the major concepts within the field of social networks, with a particular attention to social capital theory; (ii) critically examine the causes and consequences of social networks across a variety of behavioral contexts and academic domains; and (iii) achieve minimum competency in social network analysis.",

      "description": "Most every sociology course on a specific domain of social life includes a discussion of the major theories proposed by sociologists in that specialty. This course is different. Here, students will learn not about theories of some specific sociological specialty, but instead contemporary sociological theories — period, full stop. What is offered by this course is an introduction to perspectives on society that link together the different facets of social life. These perspectives claim that the same insights can illuminate not just, say, education but also work and the family. They represent lens that can be used to view and understand these various social spheres, or they identify common trends that affect them. Students will gain from this course a deeper understanding of the most general questions asked by sociologists today, and which link together the more narrowly focused view of each individual study or subfield.We strongly encourage students to take SOCI3003 before taking this course.",

      "description": "This course explores social phenomena that are so familiar they can escape our notice. Yet, they are highly organized and massively important to our lives. We will introduce the methodology of video analysis in sociology as a way to investigate social interaction in everyday life. Video analysis has been used to study a large variety of activities, for example, how people greet each other, how families eat together, how people taste cheese before buying, how skateboarders take turns in pool skate sessions, how people pass through doors, how tourists use Google maps to navigate through a city, and so on. The course is hands-on. You will be taught how to make your own video-recordings, as well as how to transcribe and analyse your data. There will be frequent in-class activities and discussions, so you are expected to be prepared and ready to contribute. Through your engagement in the course, you will gain an appreciation of the importance of real-time, observable behaviours for the accomplishment and maintenance of social interaction. You will also develop your powers of observation, attention to detail, and analytical skills.",

      "description": "Health is a fundamental aspect of human existence and medicine is arguably the crown jewel of modern science. We all want good health, effective treatments of illness and affordable health care. Yet present-day health care is the flashpoint of many controversies: about the conflicts between patients and doctors; about the safety of medical treatments and reliability of medical knowledge; about inequality in health and longevity; and about the ever-increasing health care spending. This course dissects these issues from a sociological perspective. We ask questions such as: What counts as illness? How do people understand illness? How does illness affect people’s life? Who gets ill and why? What is the role of medical technology in fostering health? Why do doctors and patients have trouble communicating? How should health care systems be organized?",

Recognizing that environmental problems are often intricately connected with the conditions of societies that they are situated in, we will explore the processes underlying social and environmental changes as well as the consequences that those processes may entail at national, regional, and global levels. Substantive topics to be covered include limits of growth and development, sustainable production and consumption, climate change and global governance, and environmental movement. The course also aims to promote an awareness and understanding of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) framework put forward by the United Nations in 2015 so as to facilitate a broader discussion and reflection on how individuals and societies can work together and find solutions to those environmental challenges.",

      "description": "In the past decades, the world witnessed a sea change in the influence that scientific knowledge has in shaping the course of our economy and culture. From the development of iPhone to the Covid-19 vaccine, ours is a society organized around and even controlled by expert knowledge systems. Meanwhile, science itself also underwent increasingly fiercer attack by outsiders, a typical example being the disagreement on whether the climate change is real. Sociology of scientific knowledge offers us a set of tools to understanding and analyzing these heatedly debated big questions in society today. By critically analyzing science, scientists, and the system of knowledge production that they created and maintained, this course surveys major topics and recent developments in the social studies of science. The arrangement of these topics follows a micro-to-macro sequence: First, the course discusses personal level STEM experiences, such as STEM educational pipeline and STEM job market; then, the course discusses institutional and disciplinary level analysis of how science works and how innovations come about; lastly, the course moves on to society, national, and international level of the impact of science, using examples from the platform economy, the international politics and the global pandemic. By the end of the course, students will develop basic knowledge towards the Technology Facilitation Mechanism for supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, through critically examining the multistakeholder collaboration between scientific community, nation states and other stakeholders in the STI policy cycle.",

      "description": "To Sutherland and Cressey, criminology is the body of knowledge regarding crime as social phenomena, which encompasses the process of making laws, breaking laws, and reacting to the breaking of laws. With a comparative perspective, this course focuses on how governments and law enforcement agencies in different societies intervene in the breaking of laws in a globalized world. The course begins by introducing various concepts of social control from a sociological standpoint. In addition to a review of the relevant criminological theories and empirical research findings, the course assesses the major impact of globalization on public security and explores the proliferation of transnational criminal activities in the process. Finally, the course will examine how social control agencies react and seek to address these problems in local and global context.",

      "description": "This course is a nontechnical introduction to the intellectual and methodological developments that undergird the exciting new era of social research using randomized experimental and quasi-experimental designs. Through in-depth case studies of exemplary empirical studies based on randomized experimental/quasi-experimental designs, the course will demonstrate how basic research could help understand human attitudes/perceptions/behaviors and provide evidence-based guidance for policymaking.This course is intended for students in their third or fourth year of college. The course coverage will be helpful to students who intend to pursue more advanced academic training, government sector jobs that place a premium on program evaluation and quantitative literacy, or service industry jobs that have witnessed a surging demand for big data applications. A one-term course on basic statistics is essential for understanding the technical but elementary terms used in this course. Still, math and statistical skills are not required to excel in this course.Specifically, the course is designed to achieve three learning objectives:1. To master the generalized experimental methodology by studying the core principles of experimental designs and some exemplary social science experimental studies. 2. To ask real-world questions that can be answered with randomized experiments (of various forms) to understand human perceptions/behaviors, induce behavioral changes, and inform evidence-based policymaking.3. To gain intuitive understanding of the counterfactual paradigm for causal thinking (i.e., using quasi-experimental designs) when truly randomized experiments are infeasible.Evaluation of learning progress and performance will closely align with the course objectives. The course assessments would emphasize the conceptual and empirical understandings of experimental designs and their real-world applications through a group project presentation and a short research proposal written by individuals. The primary language of instruction, teaching materials, and students’ written submissions will be in English.",

      "description": "Having access to adequate housing is a basic human right under Article 25 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Housing not only satisfies ontological needs but also plays a critical role in social stability and individual well-being. Decades later, housing problems in both local and overseas societies remain acute. However, we now have a better understanding of the social causes and consequences of these issues through years of empirical research and studies, hence with potential ways to achieve more sustainable housing. This course examines housing from a broad social science perspective while providing students with a solid foundation in the sociological understanding of housing. The course begins with a review of the literature, exploring the political economy of housing production and consumption. Key topics include: An examination of the various agents involved in the housing market, including tenants, landlords, urban planners, and developers. Reflections on the social construction of the meaning of housing and its implications for individuals and communities. A discussion on the financialization of the housing market and the unequal accessibility of mortgage credits, which shape life chances and create new forms of inequality in urban centers. The impact of living in substandard housing on health and psychological well-being. Issues of housing segregation along ethnic and racial lines, gentrification, displacement, and homelessness. The complex relationship between housing and welfare policy. Through this comprehensive examination, students will gain insights into the multifaceted nature of housing issues and the critical role of sociology in studying them.",

Conducted by faculty from the Sociology Programme, this course focuses on the exploration of social issues and cultural dynamics in various environments outside of Hong Kong.Students will engage with diverse communities, enhancing their understanding of social structures and cultural practices in different contexts. The course encourages students to conduct comparative studies across different societies, promoting critical thinking about sociological concepts and their application. Students will interact with local scholars/university students and/or community members, fostering cross-cultural dialogue and collaborative learning experiences. A study trip to a selected destination outside of Hong Kong will take place during term breaks, providing immersive experiences in the field. Students will be required to engage actively in all course activities, including lectures, workshops, and field studies. The assessment will include individual and group-based assignments, culminating in a reflective report that integrates their field experiences with sociological theories. By the end of the course, students will have developed practical skills in sociological research and analysis, enhancing their capacity to engage meaningfully with global social issues and contributing to their growth as informed global citizens.",

The course will first examine key steps in conducting survey research, from formation of research problem and hypothesis, sampling methods, questionnaire construction, types of data collection, handling of nonresponse and missing data, to data management, statistical analysis and inference, and interpretation of results. A secondary objective of the course is to introduce ‘unconventional’ data types in social science research, such as texts, social media and web data, and research strategies for analysis and visualization. The course emphasizes hands-on experiences with statistical software in data processing and analysis.",

This course provides Sociology students with an array of opportunities to engage in an immersive community service-learning experience. Working with community partners under the guidance of course instructor as well as mentors (in-service Sociology alumni teachers or community workers), students will complete specific projects and volunteer activities catered for specific learning needs of a student group in real-life setting, like teaching/tutoring/sharing knowledge, or designing a series of lessons particular topic on particular topic or problem the selected student group encountered. Using the sociological imagination, students will identify the problem/ topic, gather information, design teaching/ learning objectives and outcomes, adopt appropriate delivering strategies, implement the plan with collaboration with their fellows and community partners. Upon completion of the practicum, students will put their sociological knowledge into dialogue with the experiential input from the service-learning setting, activities, and community partners through structured in-class discussions.",

      "description": "This course introduces to students the key theories, approaches, and ideas in the field of sociology of education. We will explore influential studies in sociology of education, and link them to educational challenges and problems in the real world. Education-related topics covered in this course will include stratification and inequality, school, family, peers, community, rural-urban divide, migration, gender, technology, mental health, mass education, and elite formation, among others. Through studying these topics, we will also discuss how education is connected to individual, community, and national development, such as whether education reduces poverty and promotes social mobility. Readings will not be region-specific but topic-based, covering empirical evidence across the world and representing the typical research questions on a particular topic. By reading and discussing empirical studies throughout the course, students will learn how to discover and analyze the key sociological and practical issues of education both locally and internationally.",

      "description": "Many sociologists predicted that religion would gradually fade away in modern society and ‘modernity’ would eventually triumph over the ‘enchanted world’. On the contrary, the revival of traditional religions, blooming of new religious cults/sects, wide spread charismatic movement and fundamentalist movement of various sorts are taking place. Some contemporary sociologists therefore argued that we are in an age of ‘re-enchantment’ instead of ‘disenchanted’ modern society.The course will be divided in two parts. In the first part, we will start from Max Weber’s theory to see how sociologists conceived the relation between religion and modernity as well as their conflicts. In the second part, we will go through contemporary issues concerning religious fundamentalism, religion and society in East Asia, China and Hong Kong.",

Integrating academic curriculum with supervised internship, this course provides students with the opportunity to make sense of real-life work experiences with the sociological imagination. Course seminars aim at two objectives: to advance students’ career preparedness with exposure to work, and to transform their sociological knowledge into sustainability skills that are essential for promoting organisational change for a sustainable future. Aside from gaining on-the-job skills, students will learn to apply sociological analysis to study their internship organisations in both private or public sectors. Utilizing critical thinking – a core feature of sociological training, students will identify and reflect on specific values, goals, workflow and structure, and social and environmental impacts of an organisation through their first-hand experiences in various professions. To successfully enrol this course, students must secure their local internship arrangement through obtaining approval from the field supervisor and the course instructor. Students must complete a minimum of 100 hours of supervised internship work aside from the regular course assignments and attending course seminars.",

Yet lurking behind prosperity and development is the widening of regional and social inequalities, the persistence of social exclusion and discrimination, and the emergence of new forms of social problems. Using insights from a variety of sociological theories such as the anomie, labeling, Marxist, feminist, and social constructionist perspectives, this course engages students in sociological debates about the meanings, patterns, causes, and consequences of these issues, and their impact on our lives and identities.",

We all want good health, effective treatments of illness and affordable health care. Yet present-day health care is the flashpoint of many controversies: about the reliability of medical knowledge; and about inequalities in health and longevity. This course dissects these issues from a sociological perspective. We ask questions such as: What counts as illness? How do people understand illness? How does illness affect people’s life? Who gets ill and why? What is the role of medical technology in fostering health? Why do doctors and patients have trouble communicating?This course surveys major approaches and areas in the sociological study of health, illness and medicine. The central idea is that we cannot understand the topics of health, illness and medicine simply by looking at the biological phenomena and medical knowledge, but instead, we must also consider a variety of social, political, economic, and cultural forces.",

We do not simply take class as objective structural positions; we also perceive class as crucial social boundaries and distinctions that have to be practiced, performed and reproduced in various social fields. Such a perspective will help us to discover and reflect how our social life is ‘classed’.",

      "description": "This course examines qualitative methods used in social science research. Since qualitative research is both an ‘analytic mentality’ and a set of practical skills, the course will focus both discussions of key methodological and empirical readings as well as on practical skills, such as case and informant selection, field experiences, interview techniques, writing field notes, and analyzing and writing qualitative data. The course is in a seminar format. Lectures will be interwoven with discussions. Students are also required to conduct a small-scale pilot qualitative research project using the skills discussed in the seminar.",
