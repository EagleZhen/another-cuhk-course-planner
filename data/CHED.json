Participants will be provided with opportunities to consolidate their understandings of foundational concepts in mathematics, science and technology. They will also explore various ways to develop appropriate learning activities to foster young children’s development. This will include active exploration and manipulation of concrete materials and technological visualizations.\nThis course will study teaching methods and key sequences for developing young children’s concepts and knowledge in the following: number, space, measurement, chance and data, patterns, body structure and functions, living and nonliving things, plants and animals, energy, water and gas, and simple toys. Participants will be able to master the skills to help young children acquire simple specific skills, such as observing and recording changes, making predictions and assumptions, and classifying objects.",

The application of these theories and knowledge in early childhood education institutions will be illustrated at three different levels: social, school and individual. First, topics on rationale of accountability and quality assurance mechanism, data driven school improvement and matters in preparation for school self-evaluation and external review will be examined. Second, the implementation of school-based management such as resource management, professional development of teachers and team building will be discussed. Third, teacher professionalism and ways to equip early childhood practitioners with sufficient knowledge in order to fulfill their respective roles as school leaders or teacher leaders will be discussed.

      "description": "This course introduces to students the nature of aesthetic experience and its significant role in the early years of human development. The interrelated development of empathetic understanding, imagination, and creativity through the arts will be discussed. Focus will be given to the design of activities that facilitate young children's appreciation and creative expressions of different forms of arts. These forms encompass visual arts (e.g. drawings, paintings, handicraft, sculpture, photography), language arts (e.g. picture books, poems, fairy tales), expressive arts (e.g. music, dance, drama), and the integrated arts. All the above forms could be actualized in various kinds of play, which serve as an ideal form for creative expressions. With the view to uncovering the dynamics of creativity development, we shall pay attention to the processes of symbolic mediation (internalization and externalization processes inclusive). Recognizing that creativity is the essence of human existence, deliberations will be given to facilitate creative expressions of a young child in the context of kindergartens, home, and community.",

The purposes and processes of various types of educational research, such as ethnographical research, survey research, experimental research, ex post factor research, action research, and etc. will be illustrated with examples of educational studies. The primary statistical tools will be demonstrated to help the participants understand how the tools can be appropriately applied to educational research. In learning and understanding the various aspects of educational research, the participants will be provided with the opportunity to experience how to generate and shape a research question and how to choose a research method to approach to the question.\n\nStudents’ competence is assessed by their performance in writing coherently and fluently a proposal for a potential research project, demonstrating sound ideas of identifying a research question, selecting appropriate research designs to address the question, and presenting clear understanding of the requirements for each component of a research project.

      "description": "This course aims to provide students with theoretical foundations in selected areas of special needs, and to help them to understand possible learning difficulties that preschool children with these special needs would encounter. Selected areas of special needs include: (i) autism spectrum disorder; (ii) emotional and behavioral disorders; (iii) specific language impairment; (iv) physical disabilities; and (v) intellectual disabilities. For each kind of special need, students will learn its characteristics, causes, and provision of special education in Hong Kong. Besides, this course will also prepare students for developing essential intervention strategies and techniques to help children with learning difficulties. Students will also work in small groups, under the supervision of the instructor, to conduct case studies in order to strengthen their knowledge of the learning difficulties of selected groups of children.",

Topics to be covered include: ways to build rapport with young children, use of toys, drama, art, music and other creative techniques to work with children with various abilities. Throughout the course, students are expected to gain better understanding of children's feelings and needs, and become more aware of the ways to respond to children. Such an understanding will enable students to facilitate the development of positive emotional relationship and improve behaviors of children, which ultimately allow more learning to take place. The roles of family and school in working with young children will be emphasized.",
