      "description": "This course introduces students to jazz music and its connections to both African-American culture and global social-historical contexts. The first half of the semester focuses on the development of jazz in the United States, surveying the rise of the music as an African-American art form over the course of the twentieth century, with attention to blues, ragtime, swing, bebop, modal jazz, free jazz, and fusion. The second half of the semester considers jazz as a transnationally circulating cultural form that is both a product of and a contributor to globalizing trends, examining jazz’s circulations and permutations in contexts ranging from 1930s Shanghai to present-day West Africa. Through this course, students will gain a familiarity with the history of jazz, some of its major innovators, and its musical characteristics. Critical and close listening will be an important aspect of this course; through in-depth audition and discussion of musical examples, students will gain aural skills that increase their appreciation and understanding of jazz music. At the same time, by examining jazz in relation to issues including race, ethnicity, political consciousness, globalization, and economics, students will develop skills in thinking critically about music’s connections to social, cultural, and historical contexts. No musical background or previous study of music is required.",

      "description": "In the West, Beethoven is widely regarded as the greatest composer in the history of music and even of mankind. The stories of Beethoven’s broken family, failed love-life, and hearing loss have enthralled Western audiences as much as the sounds of his piano sonatas, string quartets, and symphonies. When the Berlin Wall was demolished in 1989, it was accompanied by Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy.” Yet, despite Western claims to Beethoven’s universality, nowhere else in the non-Western world is Beethoven held in such esteem–except for China. Since the late (if not even early) twentieth century, Beethoven has had more admirers in China than in the West. Who exactly is this Beethoven? And how was it that he, an Austro-German composer who read into Hinduism but never (so far is as currently known) into Confucianism, became a cultural icon both for and of the Chinese? Scholars still just do not know. In this course, we will try to figure it out for ourselves. By listening to and viewing Beethoven’s masterworks and hearing/seeing them in both their original Western and Chinese contexts, we will debate what makes this one person collectively Western, Chinese, and universal (or not). In addition to listening and reading assignments, students will research an independent essay/concert review on Beethoven and his music, whether in Greater China, the West, or both. The abilities to read or hear music are not required to excel in this class.",

      "description": "Success is defined as the accomplishment of an aim or purpose. This definition implies that successful individuals engage in purposeful, agentic pursuits. Success in attaining task goals confers a feeling of competence; success in reaching relationship goals gives one a feeling of acceptance. Both feelings are major ingredients of mental health. Success in attaining valued goals requires the abilities to adapt to change. These abilities include openness to diverse ideas, cognitive flexibility, creativity, emotional stability, motivation and perseverance. Behavioural research has shown that success is more likely among people who possess several self-attributes. In this course, we will empower students with theoretical and empirical knowledge of these attributes, and engage them in weekly experiential activities, through which they will develop and weave these self-attributes into their daily goal pursuits. Through the use of a self-assessment online platform, student will track their personal growth in these self-attributes. Major aspects of the successful self that will be covered in this course are: the rational self, veridical self-knowledge, the transcendent self, the socially intelligent self, the loved self, the multicultural self, and the global self.This course is closely related to the SDG subgoal of promoting mental health and well-being. First, psychological well-being ensues from attaining one's valued goals. In addition, feeling competent and feeling accepted are two pillars of psychological maturity and mental health. In this course, students will learn the concepts and practical skills that would enable students to more effectively attain their valued goal, and feel competent and accepted.",

      "description": "Research over the last couple of decades sheds light on the role of positive emotions and cognitions in our psychological functioning. Empirical evidence shows that people who harbour positive emotions achieve better life outcomes, which include, but not limited to, physical and mental health, work performance, supportive relationships, and effective coping. This Course is designed to provide students with the latest scientific knowledge on the development of positive psychology as well as its applications. Students will not only learn practical behavioural, cognitive and social skills that enhance their positive emotions and thus resilience and strength, they will also learn to identify and leverage their own virtues and strengths in their daily life. All of which are part of the essential life skills that not only build resilience and strength, but also the confidence and flexibility required of our young men and women to rise above the challenges they face nowadays, and lead a flourishing and meaningful life.",

      "description": "(UGED1602 is double-coded with SOWK1130.) Death is not special. It happens every day and everywhere. It is also an inevitable part of life. Yet, death is very important for us especially when we are confronted by the death and dying of our loved ones. Surprisingly, we have done little to prepare ourselves to get familiar with the topic of bereavement. Very often we learn it only from the most painful and heartbreaking moments in life—after the death of loved ones. While bereavement may induce us different grief reactions, and adjustment difficulties, it also provides an opportunity for us to experience personal growth, reflect on our values and search for the meaning in life. As a result, this course aims to prepare students to face death, dying and bereavement that they may encounter in their life. In particular, they are facilitated to respond to a unique question, “How can I live with the grief?” This question can only be answered by the students themselves who will have an opportunity to understand more about death, dying and bereavement, as well as reflecting on their life and living through this course.",

      "description": "This course examines the challenges and issues faced by Deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) individuals when they attempt to adapt themselves to the teaching and learning practices and communication styles in a mainstream postsecondary educational context. This adaptation is particularly challenging when these variables could be fundamentally different from their previous learning experiences. For instance, they may encounter difficulties when they participate in lectures, tutorial or group discussions, presentations, lab work,...etc. resulting in communication barriers and social alienation. Within UN’s SDG Framework, the course enables students to achieve a general understanding of the nature and causes of hearing loss (SDG #3: Good Health and Well-Being), and how to reduce communication barriers while dispelling misconceptions and negative attitudes towards D/HH individuals (SDG #10: Reduced Inequalities). Additionally, the course examines how the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) tackles issues relating to deafness, sign language, Deaf communication, and information accessibility in education and public domains. Students will analyze the economic, social, and environmental challenges faced by D/HH communities, such as limited access to healthcare, education, and employment. These challenges are explored in the context of how they perpetuate inequality and restrict opportunities for D/HH individuals (SDG #16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). At a broader level, the course underlies the impact of communication barriers on the quality of life and opportunities available to D/HH individuals. It also emphasizes the circumstances within a mainstream postsecondary educational context, D/HH individuals can be afforded equal opportunities and appropriate support to achieve quality education. (SDG #4: Quality Education).This course contains 7 themes each of which is packaged with a set of pre-recorded lectures and micromodules supplemented with multimedia resources such as YouTubes, Ted talks, DHH sharings and Deaf documentaries.",

This lecture provides an introduction to this philosophy through a discussion of the novel\nThe Stranger.\nWeek 9\nTopic: Repetition and the Eternal Recurrence of the Same\nDescription: Nietzsche formulates a way of thinking about the repetitiveness of existence, and this lecture will apply these thoughts in connection with a discussion of the film\nGroundhog Day.\nWeek 10\nTopic: Language and Presence\nDescription: This lecture focuses on the role of language in existentialist literature, and more specifically the gap between language and reality.\nWeek 11\nTopic: Waiting, Inaction, Boredom\nDescription: Accompanying the sense of individual freedom, protagonists in existentialist literature often experience a sense of purposelessness. The lecture will discuss this challenge in connection with works by Beckett and Coppola.\nWeek 12\nTopic: Memory, Regret, and Existence\nDescription: The course began with Sartre’s notion of choice; this penultimate lecture looks at the time when these choices have been made, and when people will have to live with these decisions.\nWeek 13\nCourse Summary & Conclusion",

      "description": "(UGED2186 is double-coded with ENGE2130.) Why read literature? This course offers a broad look through literary history to understand the enduring value and diversity of literature. For each lecture, we will look at a literary masterpiece — from antiquity to the present — and address three main issues: A) the work and its historical context; B) how to read it; and C) themes that make the work relevant in contemporary society and in our everyday lives. The course is designed as an introductory survey of literary works that have had a major impact throughout the ages. Issue A) is intended to give students a sense of the work’s impact in its own time; B) is designed to provide students with the conceptual tools and methodologies to understand a classic work of literature; while C) will provide students with an opportunity to make connections between their own individual concerns and those of the great characters of literature. At the end of the course, students will have encountered some of the most esteemed classics in literary history. No previous studies in literature needed to take this course. Students interested in discussing the ideas, ideals and values of classic literary texts are welcome to attend this course. NB: students are expected to read only EXCERPTS of the works. However, it is expected that students will read at least ONE full-length work (for the course essay).",

      "description": "(UGED2187 is double-coded with ENGE2140.)  What’s a hero? What’s a superhero? Why and when do we need superheroes? How to be one and who gets to be one? We will begin by tracing the origins of this enduring pop fiction, from the hero’s journey in antiquity to the outbreak of the Second World War. We will also explore the moral ambiguity and mixed values of some of the most memorable characters. Furthermore, we will examine revisionist approaches to the superhero genre that respond to the hopes and disillusionments of the contemporary era. Topics covered will include good and evil, power and identity, and justice and responsibility. You may also have the chance to design your own superheroes. It is hoped that by the end of the course, you will develop new ways of reading superhero narratives as uniquely modern myths.",

      "description": "(UGED2195 is double-coded with ENGE2110.) This course takes a closer look at the genre of crime fiction. The course outlines a broad perspective of the genre of crime fiction from its earliest incarnations to modern-day TV drama. We will explore a variety of different forms of crime fiction, and how the genre more generally reflects cultural, historical and social issues. The study material for this course will consist of literary texts, TV series, and films drawn from the popular cultural canon. Topics we will discuss include conspiracy, serial crime, trauma, the epistemology of clues, history and crime, and the criminal mind. The course begins with a historical overview of detective fiction, and concludes with a creative workshop on how to write a detective story. Students with a taste for murder, crime, and suspense — and above all the desire to solve enigmas and mysteries — are welcome to attend this course.",

      "description": "(UGED2197 is double-coded with ENGE2190.) The course will consider myths and legends from around the world with particular sensitivity to one peculiar aspect of them: that the gods depicted in them often behave no better than the people whose lives they determine. In order to explain why this is the case, the course will seek to understand the nature and function of myth, and the complex uses to which they are put in order to explain some of our most pressing questions: How did we all begin? Where are we? Who are we? Why is there so much wrong with the world? What’s the solution? Where will we go when we die? How will it all end? Although the concept of myth might seem outdated in modern secular culture, by drawing comparisons between the ancient and contemporary worlds, students will be encouraged to see how myth-making of some kind is as inevitable and innately human as the questions which prompt it. The course will begin by establishing some archetypal similarities between myths – from myths of Creation to myths of Apocalypse – and then consider myths from specific cultures – including Greco-Roman, Scandinavian, and Chinese – before considering the appeal of myth in contemporary popular culture, especially The Lord of Rings, and Game of Thrones.",

The history of song has always been closely connected with the oral tradition in literature; conversely, the musicality of literature owes much to the song tradition. Gospel, Negro Spirituals, Folk Music, the Bard Tradition, the Sean Nós tradition, the ballad and the lyric form in poetry, as well as popular music and musicals will all be examined in this course. The course will examine the different song traditions in their social and political contexts. The course will also include a song-writing element. There will be a song-writing workshop with a well-known local songwriter. Students will be asked to write a song in any genre of their choice (folk song, protest song, spiritual song etc.) and then to have that song performed either by themselves or someone else in the class. No previous studies in literature or music are needed to take this course. Students interested in exploring the connections between song and poetry and between song-writing and the poetic craft are welcome to attend this course.",

      "description": "(UGED2286 is double-coded with CURE2406.)  The exhibition has become a site of knowledge production and a prominent and diverse part of contemporary culture. Regarding “Chinese art” as a social constructed concept, the course uses “exhibition” as an entry point to engage with issues concerning Chinese art and to explore the role played by exhibitions in the formation of the knowledge of Chinese art. It introduces the current theories and debates on the theory and history of exhibition, and the display methods, examining the changing concept of Chinese art and curatorial practices through detailed analysis of case studies. The first part of the course traces the formation of the concept of “Chinese art” by looking closely at the history of exhibitions on Chinese objects from the late Qing dynasty to the early twentieth century. The second part examines important exhibitions that have shaped our understanding of Chinese art. Structured thematically, the course discusses the curatorial concepts of selective significant international exhibitions on Chinese art, and investigate how scholarly research has been transformed into exhibitions which have shaped our understanding of Chinese art, constructed identity and been deployed for political ends.",

      "description": "Each day, our life is flooded with thoughts and emotions aroused by noises outside and inside of us. Do these thoughts and emotions support the real purpose of our life, bringing fulfillment and happiness? Or do they make our life an endless cycle of stress, anger, fear, and even hopelessness? The course offers an orientation into mindfulness meditation as a possible way of “resetting,” at personal and inter-personal levels. Emphasis is on reflective participation, supplemented by knowledge of basic concepts and principles.From the formal practice of sitting cross-legged and quietly counting the breaths to the informal practice of embracing each moment in daily life, students will be guided to cultivate samma sati, or “right mindfulness,” one of the Eightfold Paths to end suffering. Mindfulness meditation (MM) is grounded in ancient Buddhist sutras named Anapanasati (“mindfulness breathing”) and Satipatthana (“foundation of mindfulness”) and 2,500 years of lay and monastic practice. It aims for the practitioner to develop one-pointed concentration on the body, feelings, mind, and dharmas (phenomena), and thereby to reflect on their impermanence, comprehend no-self, and cultivate loving kindness. Over the past decades, a whole range of secular mindfulness practices, or mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), have emerged to serve therapeutic and educational purposes. Students may also explore one or more of such modern applications, and ponder the contribution of mindfulness training to good health and well-being (Sustainable Development Goal 3), and to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) as a whole.The course will take students on a one-week retreat in a Buddhist meditation centre, preceded by readings and presentations on relevant topics, and followed by a personal reflection and a mini-research on the experience. Through undisturbed practice of mindfulness meditation away from home and along with peers and monastics, students will master the basic skills of the formal practice and begin to develop a habit of mindful living. Hopefully, they will cultivate a sense of self-compassion and connectedness with fellow human beings that fosters emotion management, harmonious relation and wise social action.",

      "description": "(UGED2316 is double-coded with FAAS2100.)  In the traditional discourse of Chinese painting, it was believed that an artist should “外師造化，中得心源” (outwardly learn from the Nature and inwardly trace the source of their own heart). Unfortunately, with the enormous temporal and geographical difference, both the Nature and the “heart-source” of the ancient masters, as well as their techniques in articulating the two, appear to be unapproachable to us living in the modern age. Likewise, the field’s ambiguous meta-language full of expressions like “氣韻生動” (infusing ch’i to show life movement) or “意趣” (subtle charm resulted from spontaneity) can also be a hurdle to uninitiated students.Distant it might seem, art, after all, is inspired by real life. This course seeks to explore the material basis of the Nature artistically heightened by the ancient artists directed by their “heart-source”. We would try to explore the abstract philosophical ideas and aesthetic ideals by looking at something physical and concrete: by visiting specific scenic sites, we would be able to compare the landscape with the paintings they inspired and have more idea on how the visual vocabulary and grammar of Chinese painting “translates” the real world; and by viewing the objects, or even experience some of the activities central to the artists’ cultural life, students would also have a more substantial understanding on the “heart-source” of these painters.This course would use the Songjiang and Wu Schools of painting as case studies. A field trip will be organized and students will be walked through the areas of Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou where the Ming Dynasty painters were active in. Through the well-preserved tangible heritage of the region, students could have a better feeling of the intangible ideational world of the ancient masters and their artistic pursuits. The endeavours of the local communities in preserving these invaluable treasures will also be reviewed.",

Both comics and film are visual arts originally developed within the period of late 19th century and early 20th century. Although film has long ago established its artistic legitimacy, comic art still struggle for recognition. However, as Will Eisner put it, comic strip is a “Sequential Art” and has its own unique aesthetic nature. This course tries to inquire the governing aesthetic principles of comics and investigate its unique method of expression. We will also try to delineate the special communication mode of comics and its relationship with different aspects of modern society and culture. Students will learn to appreciate comic art from different perspectives, and strengthen analytical skills for visual media.",

It has a far greater significance for the Chinese culture as a book of wisdom than a divination manual, by offering a wealth of knowledge and insights about the cosmos, nature, and life. It shows us the ways to cultivate virtue, enhance ability and perceive wisdom by living our lives and making judgments in harmony with the changing forces of the universe. The store of ancient wisdom accumulated in this classic is often still relevant to our contemporary world that is in constant and rapid technological, social and political changes. Through guided reading of the key notions and themes encapsulated in some selected hexagrams, students may draw from the wellspring of profound wisdom in the \"The Book of Changes\" to stimulate their reflection on the approach of life, the way of looking at the world, and the recurring issues facing humanity.",

      "description": "(UGED2622 is double-coded with ANTH2530.)  This course examines the pervasiveness of violence from an anthropological and comparative perspective. We consider a wide range of phenomena that can be called violence within diverse historical and cultural contexts. Violence is always political – whether it is manifest in the spectacular practices of torture, terrorism, or genocide, or the invisible structures of inequalities that generate educational, health, and food inequities. Specifically, we will address four SDG goals in depth: SDG#1 No Poverty, SDG #5 “Gender Equality”, SDG# 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG #10 “Reduced Inequalities” and SDG #16 “Peace, Justice and strong institutions”; The topics covered will be understood in relation to histories of colonialism and nationalism, ideologies about race, gender, and variant forms of social, economic, and political hierarchies. We further examine the effectiveness and limitations of human rights and humanitarianism as remedies, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",

      "course_syllabus": "The course consists of three main parts: (I) film form and aesthetics (week 1 to 4); (II) two main categories of movies (week 5 and 6); (III) critical theories (week 7 to 12). The first part equips students with specific film languages for film appreciation. The discussion of avant-garde movies and genre draws students’ attention to the dynamics as well as the competition between the two major modes of cultural productions. The last part introduces a variety of critical theories that will lead the understanding of movies to the rethinking of significant issues of human concerns. Key concepts will be introduced so that students can apply them in formulating their film analysis. The sequence of these issues implies a progression of knowledge from film specific to interdisciplinary approach and from film appreciation to critical evaluation.\nThe following is an outline of the course:\n(1) Introduction: Film Styles: Realism and Formalism\nThis lecture will introduce the two major styles of films: realism and formalism. It aims to explain how film is being perceived as an art form and as a representation of reality.

The concepts will be related to the two major film styles of realism and formalism.\nKey words: montage, continuity\nMovies:\nt\nhe Battleship Potemkin\n(1925),\nPsycho\n(1960),\nGodfather\n(1972),\nApocalypse Now\n(1979),\nRun Rola Run\n(1998)\n(5) Auteur Theory and Avant-garde Movies\nAfter introducing basic film languages in the previous lessons, this lecture will introduce auteur theory and avant-garde movies to exemplify movie as art. Auteur theory stresses the importance of understanding movies as imprints of film directors’ aesthetic policy and creative deployment of film languages. The discussion will lead to examination of the nature of avant-garde movie that embraces experimental spirit.\nKeywords: auteur theory, avant-garde\nMovies:\nMeshes of the Afternoon\n(1943),\nBreathless\n(1960),\nKika\n(1993),\nVolver\n(2007)\n(6) Film genres and blockbusters\nThis lecture introduces the opposite of avant-garde movies – genre movies.

The contents of the course include reflection on the conditions of human existence in the process of industrialization and globalization and investigation of various conceptions of human existence, such as in Materialism, Evolutionism, Freud, Christianity, Existentialism, Kant and Confucianism. The course concludes that the essence of human existence resides in human subjectivity and values consciousness. Based on such contentions, it will examine the meaning and types of values, and pinpoint the importance of values education to elevate the consciousness of students. Finally it inquires into the meaning of values education and the essence of Aesthetic Education, Religious Education and especially Moral Education in order to recognise their importance in making people \"truly human\".",

      "description": "(UGED2666 is double-coded with ANTH2360.) This course introduces students to the study of morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself. This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways. The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues. Students will be invited to conduct research into the mundane things ordinary people do to take care of one another in daily life.",

Is heritage conservation a social elite business?\n2. Who owns the cultural heritage, and who has the right to decide what should be reserved, and how to preserve it?\n3. International principles and local cultures, globalization and localization: the preservation of cultural heritage in different political, economic and social contexts/ countries—should there be “universal principles and philosophy” for heritage conservation? Is there a so-called “best practice”? Who has the right to decide what is “the best practice”?",

Dealing with death, both practically and psychologically, is something that all humans must face. This course examines death and death ritual through the question of what is universal and what is culturally variant about how humans face death. It looks at death and death ritual in both modern and pre-modern contexts and analyses it socially, psychologically, politically, and culturally. From the course students will learn how the treatment of death varies cross-culturally; how understandings of death have shifted over human cultural evolution; what aspects of death are universal in human experience; and how death affects contemporary politics, economics, and culture.",

Contemplative practices, which originated in Asian and Western ancient traditions, have been studied and applied in education, helping professions, and medicine for promoting self-awareness, well-being, mind-body health in the past few decades. This course provides an overview of the philosophical and spiritual roots, cultural influences, and recent scientific studies of contemplative practices in the context of holistic education (SDG#4 Quality education). After introduction of the diverse heritage of contemplative practices in East and West, followed by examining concepts and theories of contemplative practices in disciplines of philosophies, neurosciences, medicine, psychology, and education, students will reflect critically daily life experiences for developing healthy and sustainable lifestyle in the modern world with various contemplative practices (SDG#3 Good health & well-being; SDG#12 Responsible consumption and Production). Ethical attitudes are articulated through building interpersonal connection for cultivating global awareness on topics of peace and justice (SDG#16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). Apart from lectures, interactive tutorial with experiential practice activities, fieldwork, and reflective journal will be included for comprehensive understanding of the topics.",

Besides, it also aims to enhance students' thinking about education by initiating them into philosophically informed educational thoughts, thereby acquiring the mechanism of 'resourcing' oneself within 'the virtuous circle of the enhancement of thinking and the enrichment of thought' (\n強化思考與深化思想的良性循環中得以開源成泉\n). After examining some basic educational concepts and ideals concerning the nature and values of education, the course will focus on aims of education as embedded in the educational practice of cultivating desirable human qualities in educated persons, moving from general themes (in Part 1) to special themes (in Part 2), built-in with a series of workshops on thinking through reading and writing\n「讀寫進思工作坊」\n'RAW\nThinking Workshop' based on 'CAROL' method (employing the ACCESS approach for thinking\n「六維四體進思法」\ndeveloped by Roger Cheng).\nStudents are expected to:\n(1)\nBe able to thoughtfully think about how to tackle three fundamental questions concerning the nature, values and aims of education: (a) what is education? (b) why is education desirable or valuable? (c) how is education is to be practised (concerning its aims, stages and dimensions)? Answering these questions is expected to draw on educational perspectives to be known as in (2).\n(2)\nBe able to master substantive knowledge concerning four philosophically informed educational perspectives as possible answers to the above three questions: (a) 'fivefold education' for the whole person currently discussed in Hong Kong (\n五育觀、全人教育觀\n) ; (b) 'perfectionist education' advocated by Wang Kuowei (\n王國維之完人教育觀\n) as representing the modem presentation of the traditional Chinese educational thought; (c) the ideal of education for 'autonomy' advocated by the modem West, especially liberalism (\n自由教育觀\n)\n; (d) 'quality-based education' (\n品育觀\n)\n- - education as the cultivation of desirable human qualities (SAVE: attitudes-virtues as qualities of hearts\n心性\n;\nskills-excellences as qualities of powers\n才力\n)\nbased on the neo-Aristotelian perspective in relation to quality education (\n素質教育\n) advocated in the mainland China.\n(3)\nBe interested in and be able to think thoughtfully about at least one of the five special dimensions of the 'whole person education' with a sufficient philosophical depth: (a) intellectual education; (b) moral education; (c) social education; (d) aesthetic education; and (e) spiritual education, in relation to the substantive knowledge on educational perspectives as well as their own educational experiences (at home, in school and/or in the university).\n(4)\nBe ready to\ntry\nto pursue their own lines of thinking with the assistance of the 'CAROL' criteria embodied in the course of learning (including lectures and workshops) and assessment (mid term workshop serves for both 50% summative and formative assessments). Thus, they are encouraged to present their thoughts according to the 'CAROL' method of five criteria:\n(A)\nto articulate how problems of education (general problems concerning nature, values and aims of education based on certain educational perspectives, or special problems about dimensions of education) could be (C) critically discussed in drawing from (L) lectures and (R) required readings and (O) one's own thinking and experience.",

      "description": "Different values and beliefs, opposing clinical objectives, and resource limitations are persistent issues in medical and healthcare settings, from which ethical dilemmas could arise among healthcare practitioners, patients, and their family members, who are unavoidably engaged in the decision-making process in difficult health, life, and death scenarios. These scenarios may include but are not limited to organ donation, resuscitation of a terminally ill loved one, withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining and standard curative treatments for an end-of-life patient, active euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, as well as healthcare rationing. While a well-established legal and health system can provide guidelines for walking through these processes, the values and beliefs of the patients, healthcare workers, and other decision-makers (including family members and guardians) would shape the way decisions are made. Therefore, understanding the factors that may shape or influence one’s values and moral beliefs is crucial for any meaningful discussions to resolve these dilemmas. This course will use a systematic approach to guide students in understanding the moral theories and principles pertinent to the works of bioethics, identifying the morally salient features and arguments of selected clinical, healthcare, and health-related scenarios, discussing and analyzing the main bioethical issues of those scenarios, as well as describing ways to resolve the relevant moral dilemma. Students will be introduced to different simulation exercises and scenarios to realize and reflect on the factors that shape their own decisions as well as moral values and beliefs. The course will utilize lectures, tutorials, case studies, and sharing of hands-on experience to guide students in adopting an all-rounded, holistic, and perspective-based approach to discuss and resolve the bioethical dilemmas related to health, life, and death matters.",

      "course_syllabus": "1. \nBioethics and moral status: What makes living organisms possess moral status?\nThe basis of moral status, and why human beings are considered to possess moral status form the foundation of the study of bioethics. As human beings are agreed to possess full moral status, this introductory lecture will engage students in a reflection on what humans are by nature, and how human is viewed from the moral perspective, i.e. what are the specific human features that ground human moral status.\n2. \nMoral theories: Consequentialist utilitarianism\n(the consequence of an action e.g. the number of lives that matters most morally)\nvs. Categorical deontology\n(the universal principle of the duty of the action itself that matters more morally) using classic trolleyology as example: what matters more? The strengths and limitations of the two main traditional moral theories.\n3. Moral theories: Principlism.\nRecognize the origin of the 4 pillars of principlism. Identify the bioethical issues and features of scenarios in the medical and healthcare settings. Learn the principlist method to resolve the moral dilemmas identified among the four principles in different scenarios. Recognize the deficiency and limitations of principlism in resolving moral dilemmas - why principlism necessary but inadequate in addressing the dilemma of life and death issues in the public health and healthcare settings. (e.g. Who to save? Decision-making under limited healthcare resources.Treat or not treat? Life-sustaining and standard curative treatments for end-of-life and terminally ill patients.)\n4. Real life bioethical scenarios in Hong Kong and around the world.\nStart a conversation: the pressing healthcare-related issues in Hong Kong (end-of-life care, organ donation, advanced therapies, Hong Kong Genome Project). Present some landmark and relevant local and international cases of bioethics in clinical and healthcare settings. Illustrate and analyze the moral dilemma and their respective bioethical arguments. Describe means of resolution of these conflicts.\n5. Moral theories: Virtue ethics and character development.\nFrom social psychology to bioethics: Milgrim Experiment. Does virtue exist in human beings or is it relative? Is pursuing virtue a meaningful project for human beings? Does character matter in bioethics? Describe the relevance of virtue and character to bioethics, power imbalance and coercion, bioethics in experiments and clinical trials (e.g. new drugs for a terminally ill patient), the importance of informed consent and the right to withdraw.\n6. \nBeyond reasons in bioethics: Emotions, intuitions, experience, and relationships.\nHume’s Sentimentalism as a moral theory (is moral decision governed by emotion or reason more?). How sentimentalism, intuition, experience and relationships influence decision-making in bioethics and healthcare settings. Who to save? Should relationship and feelings matter? Reviewing “The Imitation Game” scenario. Case discussion: organ transplant, resuscitation of terminally ill loved ones/family members, body donation.\n7. Beyond traditional moral theories in bioethics: Non-Western, religion, care, narrative, and feminist ethics.\nNon-Western ethics: a summary of how Confucianism or other non-Western ethics (e.g. African bioethics) approach bioethical issues. Medical care against cultural or religious beliefs (Jehovah witness, non-therapeutic infant male circumcision). Care ethics: Case-based perspective vs principle-based perspective. Narrative ethics: An alternative but necessary method to bring particularity and lived experience into bioethics. Feminist ethics: is ethics gendered? How does feminist perspective contribute to understanding the pluralism of bioethics?\n8. Living in a pluralistic world of bioethics: Perspectives vs foundational approach to bioethics.\nMonism vs. Pluralism: why we need to approach bioethics in a pluralistic manner? The limitations of monistic approach to bioethics. Why and how we should approach bioethics using different perspectives and lenses.\nTutorials:\n1. \nDecision-making in healthcare settings (with simulation exercise):\nAn introduction to how the principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice are relevant and featured in healthcare scenarios. Identify the moral dilemmas in the scenarios, and reflect on the rationale behind the decisions.\n2. Moral decision-making of life and death matters (with simulation exercise to inform AI decision making):\nMoral Machine Exercise of Automated Car. Identify and reflect on feelings, sentiments as well as reasoning that go into the decision-making process. Recognize personal values and what shape one’s moral decision regarding life and death matters.\n3. Case study: Bringing it all together:\nUse case study to illustrate how a pluralistic approach to bioethics works.\nGlossary/Notes:\nCare ethics:\nHow about the genuine care and concerns for other people and living beings?\nFeminist ethics:\nCan we treat the moral theories available not as foundations but different perspectives?\nMinority ethics:\nWhat about the moral concerns of the minority?\nNarrative ethics:\nHow about the stories and experiences behind people’s decisions?\nPrinciplism:\nMoral theories that are based on one single principle seems to be too narrow… how about one that has four?\nTrolleyology:\nstems from the “trolley problem” or “trolley dilemma” invented by the contemporary British philosopher Phillipa Foot in defending the doctrine of double effect (the morality of killing to save the life of others). Trolleyology is an evolved version of the trolley problem with scenarios that trigger different moral considerations behind judgment and a chosen action.\nVirtue ethics:\nIs it the act or the character of the person who does the act that counts morally?",

      "description": "This course asks what we should value in nature (Units 1 and 2), how we should live with respect to it (Unit 3), and what future we should imagine for humanity and the planet (Unit 4). In Unit 1, we orient ourselves in our current situation: the Anthropocene, the planetary period in which a single species, human beings, has become the dominant force shaping the present and future of the planet. We also acquire some core theoretical tools for investigating what we value and how we should live. In Unit 2, we ask what, if anything, we should care about beyond our fellow human beings. Should we care about animals, plants, and ecosystems, and how should we act towards them? In Unit 3, we turn to various complementary disciplines across the humanities and social sciences to explore how humans might live differently within and towards the nonhuman natural world. In Unit 4, we turn to questions of the future, asking what kind of world we should imagine and seek to bring about for humanity and nonhuman life, on planet Earth and beyond. Where relevant, we will explore these topics through regional and local examples.This course bears on several of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will see how work in the humanities and arts can motivate climate action (SDG#13 Climate Action). By reimagining our relationship with the environment and the connections between nature and culture, we can envision more sustainable ways of life in a heavily urbanized space like Hong Kong (SDG#11 Sustainable Cities and Communities). And by transforming our attitude towards and relationship with nature, we enjoy the mental health benefits of a deepened appreciation of and connection with nature (SDG#3 Good Health and Well-Being). With its special focus on environmental issues in Hong Kong, this course also addresses conservation concerns for Life Below Water (SDG#14) and Life On Land (SDG#15). The humanities and arts provide an alternative lens through which to understand today’s economic, social, and environmental problems, and the needs of those affected by climate change.",

The ideas of death and the arguments for and against the possibility of life after death in both Chinese and Western culture will be examined from the religious, psychological, and philosophical perspectives.

      "description": "The course is designed to immerse students in a unique experiential learning journey to understand sustainability from both scientific and artistic perspectives, emphasizing active engagement and co-creation in tackling environmental challenges. We use the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a foundational framework, encouraging students to take personal responsibility for planetary wellbeing. The knowledge delivery structure unfolds in three main segments—Theories, Tools, and Studio/Lab—beginning with the students' own environmental inquiries. Collectively, we seek answers through these segments. Each segment builds on the previous one, deepening understanding, developing interdisciplinary skills for dissecting global challenges, and facilitating collaborative art projects. We aim to translate ecological research, environmental education into moving and impactful narratives that could inspire change and foster guardianship for Earth’s future.",

      "course_syllabus": "Week 1-2: Introduction to SDG and the Anthropocene Epoch\nTheories: Anthropocene and Sustainability\nDuring the initial two weeks of the course, the focus will be on introducing the students with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the concept of the Anthropocene Epoch. These topics will be thoroughly explored from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, ensuring a fundamental understanding.\nSDG-9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure\nSDG-11 Sustainable Cities and Communities\nWeek 3-4: Inter/Transdisciplinary Practices\nDuring Week 3, the course focuses on transdisciplinary approaches in defining and evaluating the social, economic, and ecological pillars of sustainability, reviewing practical tools within theoretical studies. Week 4 introduces \"Design Thinking: Trans-Species Wellbeing (Empathy) Mapping Studio,\" emphasizing design thinking in addressing complex ‘wicked problems’ real-life settings. Students develop creativity, empathy, and prototyping skills through interviewing, ideation, and rapid prototyping exercises. This week's focus is on designing human-centered solutions while considering the needs of diverse ecosystems such as soil, ocean, air, and forests.\nWeek 5-6 Environmental Art Case Studies\nIn Weeks 5-6, students will explore the diverse nature of environmental art and understand its significance in promoting critical thinking and dialogue about sustainability. They will learn how environmental art serves as a catalyst for turning ecological awareness into tangible action. The curriculum will cover the influence of artivism and eco-media on community engagement, awareness, and transformative action. Students will analyze case studies highlighting how artists collaborate with various stakeholders to tackle environmental challenges and the crucial components that contribute to the success of community-driven campaigns.\nMid-term interdisciplinary research presentation about students’ plan for Common Good Project.\n4 Studio Sessions within CUHK Farm, Forest, Marine Lab, Air Quality Monitoring Centre at PGE Station\nWeek 7 Studio Soil: Sowing Seeds of Change with Relational Aesthetics\n- - SDG Life on Land at CUHK farm\nSession focus: Art, Science, and Farming Converge to Tackle Food System Challenges\nIn the soil session, students will examine the complex issues plaguing our food systems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and the pursuit of fair nutrition and farmer welfare. Students will do a short video piece on the farm or interview local farmers to learn about community shared agriculture.\nWeek 8 Studio Air: Toxic Cloud, CO2, and Impressionism\nSDG Target 3.9.1 - calls for a substantial reduction in deaths and illnesses from air pollution.\nSession Focus: Intersection of Art and Atmospheric Science in the Context of Industrialization's Impact on Air Quality at CUHK’s Air Quality Monitoring Centre at the PGE Station\nThe air session of the course explores the intersection of art and atmospheric science in the context of industrialization's impact on air quality, as evidenced in 19th-century artworks like those of J.M.W. Turner. The analysis of nearly 130 paintings by climate physicist Anna Lea Albright, in collaboration with climatologist Peter Huybers, reveals a correlation between rising coal use, sulfur dioxide emissions, and a visible decline in air quality, reflected in the reduced contrast and white-hued shift of the paintings. Drawing workshop will be conducted in the Air Quality Monitoring Centre at the PGE Station after a brief introduction of how artists dealt with the theme of atmospheric pollution, pantone color grey and how scientists monitor air qualities in Hong Kong.\nWeek 9 Studio Forest: The Whispering or the Roaring from the Wilderness\nSDG 13 – Climate Action at CUHK forest\nSession Focus: The Synergy of Sound Art and Environmental Activism in Forest Conservation\nIn this session, students will juxtapose the immersive sound art of Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller's \"FOREST (for a thousand years…)\" with an environmental activism in Germany's Dannenröder forest led by Dr. Bente Castro Campos. Students will engage in a collaborative sound mapping exercise. They will venture into the nearby forest, equipped with recording devices, to capture the diverse acoustic signatures of the natural environment.\nWeek 10 Studio Ocean: Creative Service for Extreme Aqua Circumstances\nStudio session at Marine Lab\nSDG 14- Life Below Water\nSession focus: Deep time manifested by art, science, and conservation in the ocean\nIn our ocean session, students will dive into the pressing concerns surrounding ocean warming, drawing inspiration from Susan Schuppli's thought-provoking work \"Learning from Ice\" and Jason deCaires Taylor's mesmerizing underwater sculptures. By examining the interplay between media art, marine science, and the Earth's deep time revealed by the depth of our oceans, students will explore how 'evidentiary aesthetics' can contribute to novel ways of scientific understanding and innovate new forms of knowledge. Students will aspire to create artwork that transcends mere representations of nature's beauty, instead taking an active role in documenting, restoring, and preserving marine habitats, thereby becoming agents of change in the face of environmental challenges, a process through which they will develop and demonstrate their know-how in their final co-creation projects.\nWeek 11-12: THE COMMON GOOD PROJECT Development\nEach group will have 2 weeks to situate themselves to work with their chosen community, or collaborate with an artist's studio or a scientist's research laboratory. Students are required to regularly check-in and have interactive tutorials with their instructors, technical support team and/or science advisers (optional) to guide them through their co-creation process.\nWeek 13: THE COMMON GOOD PROJECT- Public Salon and Presentation\nSDG 17 - Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\nStudents will present their final COMMON GOOD project, synthesizing their discoveries in the art and science of sustainability and co-creation, to a public audience composed of members from the scientific and artistic communities, environmental NGO partners, and peers. They will discuss the extent to which their group has successfully addressed the inquiries they brought into the course at the beginning of the semester, reflecting on their experiential learning journey and personal growth in embracing environmental stewardship.",

Through selected films, students will be encouraged to develop critical thinking skills and concern for the meaning of life. Discussion will focus on three categories: (1) films concerning humanities: the nobleness and darkness of human nature, the joy and sadness of love, and the absurdity of life; (2) films concerning virtual reality: the implications of the emulated world in sci-fi films, self-consciousness, and the crisis of false memory; (3) the metaphysical significance in films: the image of death, the origin of holiness and evil, and theism versus atheism.",

      "description": "This course provides an opportunity for students to reflect on the formation of \"self\" in society and how the society affects our understanding of love, consumption, education, work, and meaning of life. Selected references in sociology, psychology, religion and literature will be introduced to provide a board intellectual perspective to understand the complex relationships between self and society. Students are expected to acquire an ability to analyze and critique on how different social institutions such as education, religion, family, media, work, consumerism, state, etc., affect our attitude and behaviors in some essential issues of life such as mate choice. Following the tradition of critical theory, this course assumes that this reflection is the first step for liberating from \"bad faith\" and living an authentic life. Through reflection on experience that affects them most, students are encouraged to critically examine sustainability issues concerning the well-beings of young people (topic 1, 2, 3 and SDG3), quality of education (topic 4 and SDG4), sustainability in the workplace (topic 5 and SDG8) and inequalities in the local context (topic 3, 4, 5 and SDG10).",

In societies across the world, people have different culturally-shaped senses of what their lives mean: people may live for money, love, honour or fame; for family, company, country or religion. This course examines the processes through which meanings of life are formulated and maintained in day-to-day life in societies past and present; it also explores life meaning as a way of comprehending the evolution of human societies. The course uses the concept of \"meanings of life\" as a window into the anthropological understanding of cultural difference and cultural evolution.",

Students also learn about the evolution of senses of meaning across human history, from prehistory up until the present and future, in a range of different societies.\nTaken together, these two areas of learning will enable students to think about human societies past and present, and about human lives lived within these societies, from a new perspective. In addition, it is expected that students will be able to thin\nk\nabout their own lives and personal meanings in a deeper and broader and more conscious way; in this sense, although this course is academic, it transcends the purely academic, to have a potential impact on students' own thinking about how to\nlive their lives.\nBy the end of the course, students will be expected: a) to be able to think objectively, analytically and critically about meanings of life within their own and other societies, and understand the complex linkages between individuals and society in creating meaning, b) to be able to comprehend the broad panorama of the evolution of meaning over the course of human history, and c) (this objective, although discussed in class, is purposely left untouched by examinations) to be able to understand their own lives in a fuller and more insightful way.",

Institutions such as lineage and family, marriage, religion, medical practices, art, education and politics shape our life patterns as well as social mores. Gender, as one of the building blocks of society and culture, shapes our values and is deeply embedded in our daily lives, and it weaves an intricate ideological fabric that strongly impacts our thoughts, feelings and action.  Through the exploration of selected issues in Chinese culture which are significant and relevant to everyday life, this course introduces to students historical materials which relate to, and contemporary research on, the role of gender in the making of history and culture, and how history and culture work to shape our understanding of gender. As they participate in the learning activities of the course, students will be gradually led to understand Chinese culture from a new perspective. Furthermore, students will have a chance to reflect on long-held values and beliefs which they themselves have acquired as members of this culture, or which they witness in the daily life of the community around them. While helping students to further understand the Chinese culture and history in a new gendered perspective, this course resonates with the Sustanable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by United Nations, including SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Students reflect on their various values and concepts in daily life through this course, and become a global citizen with an open mind.",

      "description": "(UGED3206 is double-coded with GDRS3011.)  In 21st century post-colonial Hong Kong, the preservation of ‘collective memory’ of this fast-changing city has become an everyday discourse. From award-winning movies, heart-warming testimonies, tabloid stories to Facebook groups and social campaigns, we have been consuming, constructing, and circulating narratives of ‘the past’. This act of remembering and exploring ‘our history’ questions a mainstream Hong Kong story of success demonstrated by economic development and material wealth, and attempts to identify discontinuities, gaps and silenced voices in the dominating narrative. It has also prompted reflections on the relation between narrative and identity — personal, collective, and spatial — in historical inquiry, and in what ways the writing of history has been shaped by disparate ideals, values, web of relations and power. This course will revisit Hong Kong’s history through the exploration of narratives documenting women, a group often made invisible in history writing, as social actors in the fabric of colonial Hong Kong. From elites’ households to textile factories, from rural villages, western-district brothels to mid-levels convents, schools and hospitals, women of different generations have worked as caregivers, breadwinners, pioneers, and educators while contesting the prescribed subordinate status as objects of exploitation in a patriarchal society. Drawing from a wide range of sources, including archival documents, published biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, family histories, school histories, and oral histories, this course will seek to introduce a multi-faceted history of colonial Hong Kong with women as the focus of inquiry. The discussion of women’s narratives will be situated in respective historical contexts linking the personal to social, political and economic changes in Hong Kong under colonial rule. It will also discuss the use of auto/biographies and oral histories as a methodology in historical research investigating the relations between memory, self and identity.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by directly engaging in critical reflections that help students work towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).",

Based on research from a wide range of disciplines including gender studies, cultural studies, sociology, psychology, counselling, media studies, among various fields, together with input from literature and popular culture, the course will cover major areas such as the following: how do we understand the notions of “love” and “intimacy” in the different social and personal contexts, what are the different stages in a relationship; the influence of cultural myths and social scripts; interpersonal processes within romantic relationships (such as attraction, social cognition, communication and conflicts, etc.); how social gender role shapes romantic feelings and behaviors; notions of equality and freedom within relationships; power and violence; intimate relationship across life span, etc. Students are encouraged to actively reflect upon their own life experience, to engage in critical discussions of cultural phenomenon through case studies, and learn to untangle the cultural myths, norms, and stereotypes that shapes our private lives and our society in general. Upon the completion of the course, students should demonstrate basic understanding of structure, functions, dynamics, and development of romantic love and other interpersonal relationship. The personal is political. As personal relationships are the most basic social relationships that makes up the larger network of social relationships, it is hope that students could use knowledge from this course as an insight to understand, develop, and improve the quality of their own interpersonal relationship, and would aspire to build a more open and equal society starting from equalitarian and mindful personal relationships.",
