      "terms": [],
      "description": "This course introduces students to jazz music and its connections to both African-American culture and global social-historical contexts. The first half of the semester focuses on the development of jazz in the United States, surveying the rise of the music as an African-American art form over the course of the twentieth century, with attention to blues, ragtime, swing, bebop, modal jazz, free jazz, and fusion. The second half of the semester considers jazz as a transnationally circulating cultural form that is both a product of and a contributor to globalizing trends, examining jazz’s circulations and permutations in contexts ranging from 1930s Shanghai to present-day West Africa. Through this course, students will gain a familiarity with the history of jazz, some of its major innovators, and its musical characteristics. Critical and close listening will be an important aspect of this course; through in-depth audition and discussion of musical examples, students will gain aural skills that increase their appreciation and understanding of jazz music. At the same time, by examining jazz in relation to issues including race, ethnicity, political consciousness, globalization, and economics, students will develop skills in thinking critically about music’s connections to social, cultural, and historical contexts. No musical background or previous study of music is required.",

How are megamusicals like Phantom of the Opera and Les Misérables different from the other musicals? What can we listen for to enhance our appreciation for musicals? This course explores different perspectives of studying and appreciating the musical arts of the modern musical theatre, covering areas such as analyses of the musical elements, storytelling through motifs and themes, aesthetics and criticism, as well as gender issues, politics, and other realms of contextual studies. Examples will be drawn from the Broadway musicals since the 1950s, musical films, as well as examples from the western classical tradition if deemed necessary.

      "credits": "2.00",
      "terms": [],
      "description": "In the West, Beethoven is widely regarded as the greatest composer in the history of music and even of mankind. The stories of Beethoven’s broken family, failed love-life, and hearing loss have enthralled Western audiences as much as the sounds of his piano sonatas, string quartets, and symphonies. When the Berlin Wall was demolished in 1989, it was accompanied by Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy.” Yet, despite Western claims to Beethoven’s universality, nowhere else in the non-Western world is Beethoven held in such esteem–except for China. Since the late (if not even early) twentieth century, Beethoven has had more admirers in China than in the West. Who exactly is this Beethoven? And how was it that he, an Austro-German composer who read into Hinduism but never (so far is as currently known) into Confucianism, became a cultural icon both for and of the Chinese? Scholars still just do not know. In this course, we will try to figure it out for ourselves. By listening to and viewing Beethoven’s masterworks and hearing/seeing them in both their original Western and Chinese contexts, we will debate what makes this one person collectively Western, Chinese, and universal (or not). In addition to listening and reading assignments, students will research an independent essay/concert review on Beethoven and his music, whether in Greater China, the West, or both. The abilities to read or hear music are not required to excel in this class.",

      "description": "Success is defined as the accomplishment of an aim or purpose. This definition implies that successful individuals engage in purposeful, agentic pursuits. Success in attaining task goals confers a feeling of competence; success in reaching relationship goals gives one a feeling of acceptance. Both feelings are major ingredients of mental health. Success in attaining valued goals requires the abilities to adapt to change. These abilities include openness to diverse ideas, cognitive flexibility, creativity, emotional stability, motivation and perseverance. Behavioural research has shown that success is more likely among people who possess several self-attributes. In this course, we will empower students with theoretical and empirical knowledge of these attributes, and engage them in weekly experiential activities, through which they will develop and weave these self-attributes into their daily goal pursuits. Through the use of a self-assessment online platform, student will track their personal growth in these self-attributes. Major aspects of the successful self that will be covered in this course are: the rational self, veridical self-knowledge, the transcendent self, the socially intelligent self, the loved self, the multicultural self, and the global self.This course is closely related to the SDG subgoal of promoting mental health and well-being. First, psychological well-being ensues from attaining one's valued goals. In addition, feeling competent and feeling accepted are two pillars of psychological maturity and mental health. In this course, students will learn the concepts and practical skills that would enable students to more effectively attain their valued goal, and feel competent and accepted.",

Empirical evidence shows that people who harbour positive emotions achieve better life outcomes, which include, but not limited to, physical and mental health, work performance, supportive relationships, and effective coping. This Course is designed to provide students with the latest scientific knowledge on the development of positive psychology as well as its applications. Students will not only learn practical behavioural, cognitive and social skills that enhance their positive emotions and thus resilience and strength, they will also learn to identify and leverage their own virtues and strengths in their daily life. All of which are part of the essential life skills that not only build resilience and strength, but also the confidence and flexibility required of our young men and women to rise above the challenges they face nowadays, and lead a flourishing and meaningful life.",

Yet, death is very important for us especially when we are confronted by the death and dying of our loved ones. Surprisingly, we have done little to prepare ourselves to get familiar with the topic of bereavement. Very often we learn it only from the most painful and heartbreaking moments in life—after the death of loved ones. While bereavement may induce us different grief reactions, and adjustment difficulties, it also provides an opportunity for us to experience personal growth, reflect on our values and search for the meaning in life. As a result, this course aims to prepare students to face death, dying and bereavement that they may encounter in their life. In particular, they are facilitated to respond to a unique question, “How can I live with the grief?” This question can only be answered by the students themselves who will have an opportunity to understand more about death, dying and bereavement, as well as reflecting on their life and living through this course.",

This course will look at and examine the thoughts on which these proposals are based, as well as the responses of critics at their time and modern-day assessments. Students will understand and reflect philosophically on such ethical concepts as excellence, virtue, and happiness. They will also learn to appreciate how these various proposals can make a distinctive and practical contribution to their search for a good life.",

The course will highlight the psychological and biological foundations of language, and the applications of linguistics to other fields. Students will develop a basic understanding of language as a computational system that interacts with other cognitive systems of the human brain. The course will also discuss the social aspects of language and the computational processing of human language. Students will become more sensitive to their own use of language, and develop an appreciation of recent advances in linguistic science, with respect to universals and particulars of language, language and society, language variation and change, language acquisition, as well as language, mind and the brain.",

      "description": "This course examines the challenges and issues faced by Deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) individuals when they attempt to adapt themselves to the teaching and learning practices and communication styles in a mainstream postsecondary educational context. This adaptation is particularly challenging when these variables could be fundamentally different from their previous learning experiences. For instance, they may encounter difficulties when they participate in lectures, tutorial or group discussions, presentations, lab work,...etc. resulting in communication barriers and social alienation. Within UN’s SDG Framework, the course enables students to achieve a general understanding of the nature and causes of hearing loss (SDG #3: Good Health and Well-Being), and how to reduce communication barriers while dispelling misconceptions and negative attitudes towards D/HH individuals (SDG #10: Reduced Inequalities). Additionally, the course examines how the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) tackles issues relating to deafness, sign language, Deaf communication, and information accessibility in education and public domains. Students will analyze the economic, social, and environmental challenges faced by D/HH communities, such as limited access to healthcare, education, and employment. These challenges are explored in the context of how they perpetuate inequality and restrict opportunities for D/HH individuals (SDG #16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). At a broader level, the course underlies the impact of communication barriers on the quality of life and opportunities available to D/HH individuals. It also emphasizes the circumstances within a mainstream postsecondary educational context, D/HH individuals can be afforded equal opportunities and appropriate support to achieve quality education. (SDG #4: Quality Education).This course contains 7 themes each of which is packaged with a set of pre-recorded lectures and micromodules supplemented with multimedia resources such as YouTubes, Ted talks, DHH sharings and Deaf documentaries.",

      "description": "(UGED2186 is double-coded with ENGE2130.) Why read literature? This course offers a broad look through literary history to understand the enduring value and diversity of literature. For each lecture, we will look at a literary masterpiece — from antiquity to the present — and address three main issues: A) the work and its historical context; B) how to read it; and C) themes that make the work relevant in contemporary society and in our everyday lives. The course is designed as an introductory survey of literary works that have had a major impact throughout the ages. Issue A) is intended to give students a sense of the work’s impact in its own time; B) is designed to provide students with the conceptual tools and methodologies to understand a classic work of literature; while C) will provide students with an opportunity to make connections between their own individual concerns and those of the great characters of literature. At the end of the course, students will have encountered some of the most esteemed classics in literary history. No previous studies in literature needed to take this course. Students interested in discussing the ideas, ideals and values of classic literary texts are welcome to attend this course. NB: students are expected to read only EXCERPTS of the works. However, it is expected that students will read at least ONE full-length work (for the course essay).",

We will begin by tracing the origins of this enduring pop fiction, from the hero’s journey in antiquity to the outbreak of the Second World War. We will also explore the moral ambiguity and mixed values of some of the most memorable characters. Furthermore, we will examine revisionist approaches to the superhero genre that respond to the hopes and disillusionments of the contemporary era. Topics covered will include good and evil, power and identity, and justice and responsibility. You may also have the chance to design your own superheroes. It is hoped that by the end of the course, you will develop new ways of reading superhero narratives as uniquely modern myths.",

This course will provide an outline of developments in children’s literature in England and parts of Europe through the study of some essential, central texts as well as recent books for children. The uses of fantasy and the educational aspects of books for children will be discussed, along with notions of childhood and the nature of children. Through close reading of set texts students will be able to engage in critical techniques applicable to most literature, for the best texts for children satisfy sensitive adult readers too.",

      "description": "(UGED2195 is double-coded with ENGE2110.) This course takes a closer look at the genre of crime fiction. The course outlines a broad perspective of the genre of crime fiction from its earliest incarnations to modern-day TV drama. We will explore a variety of different forms of crime fiction, and how the genre more generally reflects cultural, historical and social issues. The study material for this course will consist of literary texts, TV series, and films drawn from the popular cultural canon. Topics we will discuss include conspiracy, serial crime, trauma, the epistemology of clues, history and crime, and the criminal mind. The course begins with a historical overview of detective fiction, and concludes with a creative workshop on how to write a detective story. Students with a taste for murder, crime, and suspense — and above all the desire to solve enigmas and mysteries — are welcome to attend this course.",

      "description": "(UGED2197 is double-coded with ENGE2190.) The course will consider myths and legends from around the world with particular sensitivity to one peculiar aspect of them: that the gods depicted in them often behave no better than the people whose lives they determine. In order to explain why this is the case, the course will seek to understand the nature and function of myth, and the complex uses to which they are put in order to explain some of our most pressing questions: How did we all begin? Where are we? Who are we? Why is there so much wrong with the world? What’s the solution? Where will we go when we die? How will it all end? Although the concept of myth might seem outdated in modern secular culture, by drawing comparisons between the ancient and contemporary worlds, students will be encouraged to see how myth-making of some kind is as inevitable and innately human as the questions which prompt it. The course will begin by establishing some archetypal similarities between myths – from myths of Creation to myths of Apocalypse – and then consider myths from specific cultures – including Greco-Roman, Scandinavian, and Chinese – before considering the appeal of myth in contemporary popular culture, especially The Lord of Rings, and Game of Thrones.",

Gospel, Negro Spirituals, Folk Music, the Bard Tradition, the Sean Nós tradition, the ballad and the lyric form in poetry, as well as popular music and musicals will all be examined in this course. The course will examine the different song traditions in their social and political contexts. The course will also include a song-writing element. There will be a song-writing workshop with a well-known local songwriter. Students will be asked to write a song in any genre of their choice (folk song, protest song, spiritual song etc.) and then to have that song performed either by themselves or someone else in the class. No previous studies in literature or music are needed to take this course. Students interested in exploring the connections between song and poetry and between song-writing and the poetic craft are welcome to attend this course.",

It introduces the current theories and debates on the theory and history of exhibition, and the display methods, examining the changing concept of Chinese art and curatorial practices through detailed analysis of case studies. The first part of the course traces the formation of the concept of “Chinese art” by looking closely at the history of exhibitions on Chinese objects from the late Qing dynasty to the early twentieth century. The second part examines important exhibitions that have shaped our understanding of Chinese art.

      "description": "Each day, our life is flooded with thoughts and emotions aroused by noises outside and inside of us. Do these thoughts and emotions support the real purpose of our life, bringing fulfillment and happiness? Or do they make our life an endless cycle of stress, anger, fear, and even hopelessness? The course offers an orientation into mindfulness meditation as a possible way of “resetting,” at personal and inter-personal levels. Emphasis is on reflective participation, supplemented by knowledge of basic concepts and principles.From the formal practice of sitting cross-legged and quietly counting the breaths to the informal practice of embracing each moment in daily life, students will be guided to cultivate samma sati, or “right mindfulness,” one of the Eightfold Paths to end suffering. Mindfulness meditation (MM) is grounded in ancient Buddhist sutras named Anapanasati (“mindfulness breathing”) and Satipatthana (“foundation of mindfulness”) and 2,500 years of lay and monastic practice. It aims for the practitioner to develop one-pointed concentration on the body, feelings, mind, and dharmas (phenomena), and thereby to reflect on their impermanence, comprehend no-self, and cultivate loving kindness. Over the past decades, a whole range of secular mindfulness practices, or mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), have emerged to serve therapeutic and educational purposes. Students may also explore one or more of such modern applications, and ponder the contribution of mindfulness training to good health and well-being (Sustainable Development Goal 3), and to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) as a whole.The course will take students on a one-week retreat in a Buddhist meditation centre, preceded by readings and presentations on relevant topics, and followed by a personal reflection and a mini-research on the experience. Through undisturbed practice of mindfulness meditation away from home and along with peers and monastics, students will master the basic skills of the formal practice and begin to develop a habit of mindful living. Hopefully, they will cultivate a sense of self-compassion and connectedness with fellow human beings that fosters emotion management, harmonious relation and wise social action.",

      "description": "(UGED2316 is double-coded with FAAS2100.)  In the traditional discourse of Chinese painting, it was believed that an artist should “外師造化，中得心源” (outwardly learn from the Nature and inwardly trace the source of their own heart). Unfortunately, with the enormous temporal and geographical difference, both the Nature and the “heart-source” of the ancient masters, as well as their techniques in articulating the two, appear to be unapproachable to us living in the modern age. Likewise, the field’s ambiguous meta-language full of expressions like “氣韻生動” (infusing ch’i to show life movement) or “意趣” (subtle charm resulted from spontaneity) can also be a hurdle to uninitiated students.Distant it might seem, art, after all, is inspired by real life. This course seeks to explore the material basis of the Nature artistically heightened by the ancient artists directed by their “heart-source”. We would try to explore the abstract philosophical ideas and aesthetic ideals by looking at something physical and concrete: by visiting specific scenic sites, we would be able to compare the landscape with the paintings they inspired and have more idea on how the visual vocabulary and grammar of Chinese painting “translates” the real world; and by viewing the objects, or even experience some of the activities central to the artists’ cultural life, students would also have a more substantial understanding on the “heart-source” of these painters.This course would use the Songjiang and Wu Schools of painting as case studies. A field trip will be organized and students will be walked through the areas of Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou where the Ming Dynasty painters were active in. Through the well-preserved tangible heritage of the region, students could have a better feeling of the intangible ideational world of the ancient masters and their artistic pursuits. The endeavours of the local communities in preserving these invaluable treasures will also be reviewed.",

Although film has long ago established its artistic legitimacy, comic art still struggle for recognition. However, as Will Eisner put it, comic strip is a “Sequential Art” and has its own unique aesthetic nature. This course tries to inquire the governing aesthetic principles of comics and investigate its unique method of expression. We will also try to delineate the special communication mode of comics and its relationship with different aspects of modern society and culture. Students will learn to appreciate comic art from different perspectives, and strengthen analytical skills for visual media.",

It has a far greater significance for the Chinese culture as a book of wisdom than a divination manual, by offering a wealth of knowledge and insights about the cosmos, nature, and life. It shows us the ways to cultivate virtue, enhance ability and perceive wisdom by living our lives and making judgments in harmony with the changing forces of the universe. The store of ancient wisdom accumulated in this classic is often still relevant to our contemporary world that is in constant and rapid technological, social and political changes. Through guided reading of the key notions and themes encapsulated in some selected hexagrams, students may draw from the wellspring of profound wisdom in the \"The Book of Changes\" to stimulate their reflection on the approach of life, the way of looking at the world, and the recurring issues facing humanity.",

Specifically, we will address four SDG goals in depth: SDG#1 No Poverty, SDG #5 “Gender Equality”, SDG# 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG #10 “Reduced Inequalities” and SDG #16 “Peace, Justice and strong institutions”; The topics covered will be understood in relation to histories of colonialism and nationalism, ideologies about race, gender, and variant forms of social, economic, and political hierarchies.

      "description": "(UGED2666 is double-coded with ANTH2360.) This course introduces students to the study of morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself. This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways. The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues. Students will be invited to conduct research into the mundane things ordinary people do to take care of one another in daily life.",

      "description": "Different values and beliefs, opposing clinical objectives, and resource limitations are persistent issues in medical and healthcare settings, from which ethical dilemmas could arise among healthcare practitioners, patients, and their family members, who are unavoidably engaged in the decision-making process in difficult health, life, and death scenarios. These scenarios may include but are not limited to organ donation, resuscitation of a terminally ill loved one, withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining and standard curative treatments for an end-of-life patient, active euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, as well as healthcare rationing. While a well-established legal and health system can provide guidelines for walking through these processes, the values and beliefs of the patients, healthcare workers, and other decision-makers (including family members and guardians) would shape the way decisions are made. Therefore, understanding the factors that may shape or influence one’s values and moral beliefs is crucial for any meaningful discussions to resolve these dilemmas. This course will use a systematic approach to guide students in understanding the moral theories and principles pertinent to the works of bioethics, identifying the morally salient features and arguments of selected clinical, healthcare, and health-related scenarios, discussing and analyzing the main bioethical issues of those scenarios, as well as describing ways to resolve the relevant moral dilemma. Students will be introduced to different simulation exercises and scenarios to realize and reflect on the factors that shape their own decisions as well as moral values and beliefs. The course will utilize lectures, tutorials, case studies, and sharing of hands-on experience to guide students in adopting an all-rounded, holistic, and perspective-based approach to discuss and resolve the bioethical dilemmas related to health, life, and death matters.",

      "description": "This course asks what we should value in nature (Units 1 and 2), how we should live with respect to it (Unit 3), and what future we should imagine for humanity and the planet (Unit 4). In Unit 1, we orient ourselves in our current situation: the Anthropocene, the planetary period in which a single species, human beings, has become the dominant force shaping the present and future of the planet. We also acquire some core theoretical tools for investigating what we value and how we should live. In Unit 2, we ask what, if anything, we should care about beyond our fellow human beings. Should we care about animals, plants, and ecosystems, and how should we act towards them? In Unit 3, we turn to various complementary disciplines across the humanities and social sciences to explore how humans might live differently within and towards the nonhuman natural world. In Unit 4, we turn to questions of the future, asking what kind of world we should imagine and seek to bring about for humanity and nonhuman life, on planet Earth and beyond. Where relevant, we will explore these topics through regional and local examples.This course bears on several of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will see how work in the humanities and arts can motivate climate action (SDG#13 Climate Action). By reimagining our relationship with the environment and the connections between nature and culture, we can envision more sustainable ways of life in a heavily urbanized space like Hong Kong (SDG#11 Sustainable Cities and Communities). And by transforming our attitude towards and relationship with nature, we enjoy the mental health benefits of a deepened appreciation of and connection with nature (SDG#3 Good Health and Well-Being). With its special focus on environmental issues in Hong Kong, this course also addresses conservation concerns for Life Below Water (SDG#14) and Life On Land (SDG#15). The humanities and arts provide an alternative lens through which to understand today’s economic, social, and environmental problems, and the needs of those affected by climate change.",

We use the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a foundational framework, encouraging students to take personal responsibility for planetary wellbeing. The knowledge delivery structure unfolds in three main segments—Theories, Tools, and Studio/Lab—beginning with the students' own environmental inquiries. Collectively, we seek answers through these segments. Each segment builds on the previous one, deepening understanding, developing interdisciplinary skills for dissecting global challenges, and facilitating collaborative art projects. We aim to translate ecological research, environmental education into moving and impactful narratives that could inspire change and foster guardianship for Earth’s future.",

Selected references in sociology, psychology, religion and literature will be introduced to provide a board intellectual perspective to understand the complex relationships between self and society. Students are expected to acquire an ability to analyze and critique on how different social institutions such as education, religion, family, media, work, consumerism, state, etc., affect our attitude and behaviors in some essential issues of life such as mate choice. Following the tradition of critical theory, this course assumes that this reflection is the first step for liberating from \"bad faith\" and living an authentic life. Through reflection on experience that affects them most, students are encouraged to critically examine sustainability issues concerning the well-beings of young people (topic 1, 2, 3 and SDG3), quality of education (topic 4 and SDG4), sustainability in the workplace (topic 5 and SDG8) and inequalities in the local context (topic 3, 4, 5 and SDG10).",

Institutions such as lineage and family, marriage, religion, medical practices, art, education and politics shape our life patterns as well as social mores. Gender, as one of the building blocks of society and culture, shapes our values and is deeply embedded in our daily lives, and it weaves an intricate ideological fabric that strongly impacts our thoughts, feelings and action.  Through the exploration of selected issues in Chinese culture which are significant and relevant to everyday life, this course introduces to students historical materials which relate to, and contemporary research on, the role of gender in the making of history and culture, and how history and culture work to shape our understanding of gender. As they participate in the learning activities of the course, students will be gradually led to understand Chinese culture from a new perspective. Furthermore, students will have a chance to reflect on long-held values and beliefs which they themselves have acquired as members of this culture, or which they witness in the daily life of the community around them. While helping students to further understand the Chinese culture and history in a new gendered perspective, this course resonates with the Sustanable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by United Nations, including SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Students reflect on their various values and concepts in daily life through this course, and become a global citizen with an open mind.",

      "description": "(UGED3206 is double-coded with GDRS3011.)  In 21st century post-colonial Hong Kong, the preservation of ‘collective memory’ of this fast-changing city has become an everyday discourse. From award-winning movies, heart-warming testimonies, tabloid stories to Facebook groups and social campaigns, we have been consuming, constructing, and circulating narratives of ‘the past’. This act of remembering and exploring ‘our history’ questions a mainstream Hong Kong story of success demonstrated by economic development and material wealth, and attempts to identify discontinuities, gaps and silenced voices in the dominating narrative. It has also prompted reflections on the relation between narrative and identity — personal, collective, and spatial — in historical inquiry, and in what ways the writing of history has been shaped by disparate ideals, values, web of relations and power. This course will revisit Hong Kong’s history through the exploration of narratives documenting women, a group often made invisible in history writing, as social actors in the fabric of colonial Hong Kong. From elites’ households to textile factories, from rural villages, western-district brothels to mid-levels convents, schools and hospitals, women of different generations have worked as caregivers, breadwinners, pioneers, and educators while contesting the prescribed subordinate status as objects of exploitation in a patriarchal society. Drawing from a wide range of sources, including archival documents, published biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, family histories, school histories, and oral histories, this course will seek to introduce a multi-faceted history of colonial Hong Kong with women as the focus of inquiry. The discussion of women’s narratives will be situated in respective historical contexts linking the personal to social, political and economic changes in Hong Kong under colonial rule. It will also discuss the use of auto/biographies and oral histories as a methodology in historical research investigating the relations between memory, self and identity.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by directly engaging in critical reflections that help students work towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).",

Various aspects of romantic love and intimate relationship will be critically reviewed. Based on research from a wide range of disciplines including gender studies, cultural studies, sociology, psychology, counselling, media studies, among various fields, together with input from literature and popular culture, the course will cover major areas such as the following: how do we understand the notions of “love” and “intimacy” in the different social and personal contexts, what are the different stages in a relationship; the influence of cultural myths and social scripts; interpersonal processes within romantic relationships (such as attraction, social cognition, communication and conflicts, etc.); how social gender role shapes romantic feelings and behaviors; notions of equality and freedom within relationships; power and violence; intimate relationship across life span, etc. Students are encouraged to actively reflect upon their own life experience, to engage in critical discussions of cultural phenomenon through case studies, and learn to untangle the cultural myths, norms, and stereotypes that shapes our private lives and our society in general. Upon the completion of the course, students should demonstrate basic understanding of structure, functions, dynamics, and development of romantic love and other interpersonal relationship. The personal is political. As personal relationships are the most basic social relationships that makes up the larger network of social relationships, it is hope that students could use knowledge from this course as an insight to understand, develop, and improve the quality of their own interpersonal relationship, and would aspire to build a more open and equal society starting from equalitarian and mindful personal relationships.",
