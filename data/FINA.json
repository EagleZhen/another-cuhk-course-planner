      "description": "Traditional finance seeks to understand financial markets assuming that investors are “rational.” Rationality means that investors can access to and have the ability to process information correctly and that competition between investors ensures that securities are correctly priced to reflect all available information. That is, the market is efficient. However, recent studies suggest that markets are not efficient and that investors are not fully rational. For example, particular trading strategies based on past information such as past returns and accounting information are able to outperform the markets. In addition, studies find that investors are committed to certain heuristic-based biases and frame dependent such as overconfidence, optimism, self-attribution, illusion of control, loss aversion, representativeness heuristic, anchoring, availability, ambiguity aversion, hindsight, flaming, etc. Behavioral biases combined with limits to arbitrage may result in securities not to be correctly priced.\nThis course will help students understand how individuals’ attitudes and behaviors affect their financial decisions and financial markets. In the practical side, this course will emphasize the role of investors’ psychological biases on various types of market inefficiency and show that how sophisticated investors can take advantage of these behavioral biases. This is a research oriented course with emphasis on both psychology theories and data analysis skills.",

The principal focus is on initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned issues in Chinese stocks (including H- share, ‘red-chip’, private Chinese and ‘China-concept’ issuers) listed in Hong Kong. The characteristics of the various corporate entities and the nature of the funding methods utilized are critically explored. Case analysis of major IPO and seasoned equity issues (rights issues and private placings) features to amplify these objectives. Shanghai A- share listings are also considered as well as the various reforms to its constituent issuers. These include the transformation of non-tradable stock holdings into tradable form, the development of QFII and QDII schemes and the key reforms to China’s leading state-owned commercial banks. Finally, dual listings, such as American depositary receipts, and alternative routes to listing (‘reverse takeovers’) are also assessed. Upon completion of the course, students will have developed key insights into a major global funding activity.",

Principal objectives include: 1) offering the students through the reading materials an overview of investment; and 2) offering the students, through a series of short-form cases (“caselets”), the opportunity to strategize and be the decision maker in practical, “real world” business situations throughout the Asia Pacific region, which illustrate successful and unsuccessful investment strategies in Asia.

The class will be conducted through both lectures and student presentations. Foundations in finance will be covered through lectures format. Note that the topics covered are an extension of (advanced) financial management, however the technical part will be reduced to a minimum. Students will be grouped and are required to present real cases in Hong Kong. It is not mandatory to work on a real project. However, students have the options to do so. The class is required to apply the efficient markets hypothesis to analyze stock markets' responses to takeover announcements. Welfare gains or losses to shareholders will also be computed. Computations for the cost of capital and intrinsic value of targets, by using the dividend discount model and the free cash model, will also be required. The final project should be a comprehensive integration of all materials learned in class.",

The class will be conducted using both lectures and presentations. The topics covered in lectures include an overview of takeover markets, legal aspects and restrictions, capital budgeting techniques, the efficient market hypothesis, the market model and computation of abnormal returns, the dividend discount model and the free cash flow model. The topics covered in presentations will include US and Hong Kong cases of mergers, tender offers and leveraged buyouts. Amongst other things, the efficient market hypothesis is applied to analyse the stock market response to takeover announcement as well as a range of other issues including: welfare gains/losses associated with takeover, the cost of capital for due acquiror and the intrinsic value of the target (using dividend discount and free cashflow models).",

      "description": "This course provides an overview of the basic tools in machine learning, with emphases on applications in finance. Machine learning plays an important role in FinTech. Individual investors and financial institutions who are able to leverage these new tools and technology will have a significant advantage. This course discusses these new opportunities and challenges. It seeks to equip students with these highly coveted skills in the market. We will cover topics including: cluster analysis, decision trees, support vector machines, flexible discriminants, and neural networks, accompanied with the corresponding financial applications.\n\nReal world finance problems often deal with large datasets, traditionally with historical price and return as well as data on financial statements. More recently, other databases like consumer credit and online data (e.g., Google search, news media, satellite images, etc.) are also becoming more important for financial analysts. Dealing with such large datasets require tools to manipulate them, and we will introduce the use of Python and detailed instructions on how to perform analysis on large datasets. Once students become comfortable with the use of Python and manipulation of large sets, we will introduce students to tools in machine learning, which play an important role in our financial market, from approving loans, managing portfolios, to assessing risks. Advances in machine learning technology have enabled financial institutions to explore the applications of artificial intelligence in areas like customer service, personal finance, wealth management, and risk management.",

Students are expected to apply the acquainted machine learning techniques to solve different tasks in a wide range of financial topics. The course requires the use of Python. We will provide one review class for programing and mathematics at the beginning of the semester to get students better prepared. Prior knowledge of Python is not a requirement for this course but students who are uncomfortable with coding should not take this course. The course also makes heavy use of statistics, and students who have difficulties with quantitative materials are not suggested to take this course.\n\n科目結束時，我們希望學生能熟練掌握Python編程，並且對機器學習各種方法的原理和實際操作有深入理解。同時我們也希望學生能熟悉運用機器學習各種方法來解決不同場景下的金融問題並提出有效的解決方案。本科目需要大量使用編程語言Python。在學期開始時，我們將提供一節編程和統計基礎複習課，以便學生為之後的科目學習做好準備。本科目不要求課前具備Python編程背景，但需要學生具備基本的編程語言知識以及一定的編程經歷。同時本科目將大量使用統計學知識，學生選課前需要對數理統計和定量分析有一定瞭解。",

As VC is a subset of private equity, the course will discuss the management, legal and marketing issues of private equity in general. Topics include raising and structuring private equity funds, the limited partnership, and fund strategies. The course will consider the investment decision of institutional investors in private equity and how funds are structured to meet their needs. It will discuss post-subscription private equity fund management - deal screening, evaluation, negotiation, disbursement, investee management, valuation and exit - and will consider specifically the perspective of the VC investee company - alternative sources of financing, how to approach a VC to maximize chances of success, and governance issues in VC financed firms. The course may also delve into public versus private equity buyouts, valuation of buyouts and corporate restructuring under private equity.",

      "description": "Traditional finance seeks to understand financial markets assuming that investors are \"rational\". Rationality means that investors can access to and have the ability to process information correctly and that competition between investors ensures that securities are correctly priced to reflect all available information. That is, the market is efficient. However, recent studies suggest that markets are not efficient and that investors are not fully rational. For example, particular trading strategies based on past information such as past returns and accounting information are able to outperform the markets. In addition, studies find that investors are committed to certain heuristic-based biases and frame dependent such as overconfidence, optimism, self-attribution, illusion of control, loss aversion, representativeness heuristic, anchoring, availability, ambiguity aversion, hindsight, flaming, etc. Behavioral biases combined with limits to arbitrage may result in securities not to be correctly priced.\n\nThis course will help students understand how individuals’ attitudes and behaviors affect their financial decisions and financial markets. In the practical side, this course will emphasize the role of investors’ psychological biases on various types of market inefficiency and show that how sophisticated investors can take advantage of these behavioral biases. This is a research oriented course with emphasis on both psychology theories and data analysis skills.",
