      "description": "In the latter half of the 20th century, working in the media and communication industries referred mainly to working for newspapers, broadcasting stations, film companies, and advertising or PR industries. But with the advance of digital media technologies, old boundaries among the distinctive media sectors are seemingly blurring or even falling apart, while there might also be new types of “media companies.” This course is designed to familiarize students with the evolving realities of the various media industries in Hong Kong, China, and beyond. The overarching questions to be discussed in the class include: How can one characterize the configuration of the contemporary media industries? What are the key trends underlying the transformation of the media industries? What are the implications of these transformations for “media workers”? What does it mean by working as a journalist, a creative content producer, an advertiser, etc. in the contemporary world and in the future? What are the communication practices involved in the various industries? What are the broader social, cultural, and political implications of the transformation of media work and media industries?",

The course is designed around two major themes, namely media and social development in Mainland China since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. Using key concepts and theories from the political economy of media and developmental communication studies, it introduces students to different periods of media reform and social change from the era of Chairman Mao to the period of \"harmonious society\". Emphasis is attached to post-1989 media regulatory systems, media industrialization, and their influence on the meeting of such developmental goals as poverty alleviation, democratization, and communication empowerment.The course will examine Mainland China's key media sectors including the printing press (newspapers and magazines), film and broadcasting media (radio and TV), and new networked communication tools (Internet and mobile phone) as well as alternative social formations through Internet activism, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and transnational developmental projects. The course will identify and discuss several ongoing debates, and the ensuing actions, held by different stakeholders, including governmental officials, media producers, educators, activists, international agencies, and the general audiences. Wider implications to public policy will be identified. There will also be discussions of current affairs related to media and social development in the country.Students will be able to describe the key characteristics of contemporary Mainland Chinese media and their roles in facilitating or obstructing development towards the ideals of a \"new China\".",

      "course_syllabus": "The course consists of five main parts: (I) theories of media, communication and social development (week 1 and 2); (II) history of media transformation in Mainland China since 1949 (week 3 and 4); (III) key media sectors (week 5 to 7); (IV) social movements and campaigns (week 8 to 10); and (V) institutional stakeholders (week 11 and 12). In each part, there will be a mixture of conceptual and practical information, of consensus and controversies, and of historical knowledge and current affairs. The class will also look at different disadvantaged social groups and their relationship with various media sectors and stakeholders both within and outside officialdom.\n\nThe following is an outline of the course:\n\n* *Week 1 Introduction: Ideals of \"New China\"**\n\nThe first class will introduce students to (a) the pursuit of a \"New China\" that gave legitimacy to the rise of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) since the May Fourth Movement, and (b) classical theories of media and national development between 1950s and 1980s. It will also discuss the concept of 'social development' and give an overview of the course's core content.\n\n* Key concepts: \"New China\", nation building, communication and development*\n\n* *Week 2 Communist Media Theories: Political Control and Social Development**\n\nThis class discusses Leninist press theory, its evolution in the Chinese party-state, and the rationale behind this historical transformation, including politico-economic considerations as well as trends in cultural and technological change. Key ideas of the mass line and ICTD (information and communication technologies and development) will also be discussed in the case of rural development.\n\n* Key concepts: Leninist press theory, party-state, political control, the mass line, ICTD, rural development*\n\n* *Week 3 and 4 Past and Present**\n\nThese two classes differentiate media and social development in Mainland China into three historical periods: 1949-1978; 1978-1989; and 1989-date. What defines these periods? How are they different? Did previous periods pave the way for later trends of marketization and partial liberalization in the post-1989 era?\n\n* Key concepts: The Maoist era, pre-1989 media reform, post-1989 reform, marketization, partial liberalization*\n\n* *Weeks 5 to 7 Key Media Sectors**\n\nZooming into China's printing media (newspaper and magazines), film and broadcasting media (radio and TV), and new networked media (Internet and mobile phone), these three classes provide a sector-specific analysis of China's media systems and their contributions to meeting goals of social development. Issues of censorship and regulation will be introduced. Debates on the digital divide will also be discussed.\n\n* Key concepts: printing media, film, broadcasting media, networked media, censorship, regulation, digital divide*\n\n* *Weeks 8 to 10 Social Movements and Campaigns**\n\nThese three classes focus on official efforts to modernize China using traditional and new media channels as well as alternative communication empowerment projects such as those led by domestic labor NGOs, environmental groups, and transnational civil society players. Studies in minority-nationality regions and with regard to disadvantaged groups such as women will be discussed along with the official project of \"constructing new socialist countryside\".\n\n* Key concepts: \"constructing new socialist countryside\", activism, empowerment, feminist activism, environmental movement, minority nationalities, transnational civil society*\n\n* *Week 11 and 12 Institutional Stakeholders**\n\nWe will first return to China's media regulatory frameworks centered on the CCP's Central Propaganda Division (CPD) as well as several ministry-level governing bodies whose bureaucratic systems extend to lower levels of the party-state. Then in Week 12, we will look into China's journalism education system as another key institutional stakeholder. To what extent are the regulators and educators facilitating or hindering overall social development? Why? How could they do better? How could college students in Hong Kong play a meaningful role interacting with the stakeholders?\n\n* Key concepts: CPD, local state, media governance, journalism education, democratization*\n\n* *Week 13 Student Group Presentations and Course Wrap-Up**\n\nStudents will present their final projects in the last class, which will end with the instructor's wrap-up of the course.",

      "description": "(UGEC2623 is double-coded with COMM2210.)  This course talks about the characteristics and functioning of news, and its important role and functions in society. News is vital to us as it brings latest information of the day, helps create public opinion, educate our young generations, monitor the government and the powerful, as well as provide relaxation to our busy lives. To understand the news can essentially help us know our society. Various concepts and theories from the mass communication discipline are introduced together with some perspectives from other social sciences. Real-life examples from Hong Kong and abroad are analyzed.Students are first introduced to the unique nature of news and different types of news as found in both print and electronic media. Some new news formats, including free dailies, online newspapers, network social media and citizen journalism, are discussed in both international and local contexts. Relationships between journalism and closely related professions such as advertising and public relations are explicated in order to understand the actual functioning of news, as well as its impact on society. The professional concerns of the field of journalism and individual’s news consumption habits are also highlighted in the course.After taking this course, students will be able to understand more about news and its relationship with the society. They should be able to critically evaluate news and social phenomena. It is hoped that they can become wise news consumers and well-informed citizens.",

      "course_syllabus": "The course consists of several parts. The first part sets the stage by examining the relationship between news and society, the nature and characteristics of news, as well as inviting students to reflect on their news reading habits. The second part deals with various major types of news, including social news, political news, entertainment news, and international news. The third part is about some emerging news trends in society, including the rapid rise of free newspapers, online newspapers and the new social network media as news channels. The final part discusses institutional relationships among news, advertising, public relations, and other social sectors. The reflection on journalistic professionalism and media ethics serve to round up and highlight the role and responsibilities of news in society.\n\nThe following is an outline of this course:\n\n* *Week 1 Introduction: News and Society**\n\nThe course starts by introducing the role of journalism as a vital social institution and its unique function as the often-quoted \"fourth estate\" of the government. But in fact news serves to monitor the government and the society, and thus freedom of the press is important not only to the journalists but to the general public. Contribution of newswork to the proper maintenance of the public sphere and establishment of a civil society is emphasized.\n\n* Key concepts: journalism as social institution, journalism as the fourth estate, press freedom, public sphere*\n\n* *Week 2 What is News: Characteristics and Perspectives**\n\nNews is a complex social phenomenon. It is so familiar to us but yet a simple and clear definition cannot be satisfactorily reached among academics and practitioners. Many agree that \"immediacy\", \"importance\" and \"interest\" are the three most important components. Others see news as some sort of deviant events. Some scholars regard news as vital social information while others think of it as a commercial product. Objectivity can be regarded as a noble ideal but some say it is a \"strategic ritual\". Scholars from the humanistic tradition would treat it primarily as a \"speech act\".\n\n* Key concepts: definitions of news, the three “Is” of news, news as deviance, objectivity as strategic ritual, news net, humanistic perspectives of news*\n\n* *Week 3 Cultivating Good News Reading Habits**\n\nNews consumption patterns were stable in the past but are now showing great changes due to the coming of the Internet age. People tend to read less print newspapers and spend more time getting information online. This is especially true for the younger generations who practically grow up together with the Internet. How can we instill the value of news reading to the young people? How can they become smarter readers, no matter which news venues/channels they tune to? New technologies are a threat to existing media but they also open up new opportunities and possibilities. It is essential for our students to be news literate in order to become an informed and critical citizen.\n\n* Key concepts: changing news use patterns, news consumer, critical citizenship, media education, technological impact*\n\n* *Week 4 Social News: Taste Strata of Mass and Elite**\n\nNews about the society can vary according to the orientations of news organizations and the tastes of the reading/viewing public. The elite class has different taste preference over news when compared with the mass public. Fierce competition and marketization have driven many news organizations to go down the road of tabloidization and McDonaldization. They tend to hype the news and respond more to market \"wants\" instead of social \"needs\".\n\n* Key concepts: tabloidization, McDonaldization, market driven-journalism, hyping*\n\n* *Week 5 Political News: Monitoring Those in Power**\n\nNews is always intertwined with the government, politicians and those who have power in society. Various political forces want to control or influence the press in order to gain advantages. They feed and spin stories to the media, which on the other hand try to play the watchdog function and report news responsibly. News coverage in election settings will be examined to see how journalists and politicians interact with each other, and whether the public is properly informed.\n\n* Key concepts: spin doctoring, watchdog function, social responsibility theory, media and election, stereotyping*\n\n* *Week 6 Entertainment News: \"Interesting\", Not \"Public Interest\"**\n\nSome people love entertainment news. They are keen on the \"interesting\" acts of or self-directed promotion by certain celebrities and have little concern over \"public interest\". As a result, entertainment news tends to be trivial or muckraking. The paparazzi teams sent by news organizations could not care less about invasion of privacy or damaging celebrities' reputations. The blurring of boundaries (between truth and falsehood, right and wrong, public and private, etc.) is something we should be aware of when reading this type of news.\n\n* Key concepts: trivialization, paparazzi, personal muckraking, blurring of boundaries, invasion of privacy*\n\n* *Week 7 International News: Our Window on the World**\n\nThe course will talk about international news as the world is getting more and more global and integrated. It is essentially our window to look at the world outside. Between nations, diplomacy is often done through news reporting, which significantly reflects national interests. The major international news agencies play an important role. Journalists usually try hard to \"domesticate\" foreign news to make it more attractive to local audience.\n\n* Key concepts: media and national interest, public policy, media diplomacy, domestication of news*\n\n* *Week 8 Free Newspapers: The New Model That Works**\n\nTraditionally, TV is free but newspaper is paid. But in the past few decades, paid TV channels have quickly emerged as well as free newspapers. Print newspapers rely on both advertising and subscription or single copy sales. This business model is upset by the free newspapers which rely solely on advertising. People find that being free is irresistible, and they are less concerned about the quantity and quality of news as long as it is free of charge. What are the implications for the future of journalism? Would it popularize newspaper reading or downgrade the quality of journalism, or both? How do free dailies, paid dailies and online dailies interact? These are evolving issues worthy of closer examination.\n\n* Key concepts: distribution-driven journalism, free vs. paid, Metro Daily formula, work-habitation patterns, interactions among different types of newspapers*\n\n* *Week 9 Online Newspapers: News in the Internet Age**\n\nGoing online is a relatively new phenomenon for the press starting in the mid-1990s. It began as a low-cost spin-off that carried big promises both in terms of revenue and readership. The actual result favors the latter but not the former, and the journalism industry is still seeking a workable business model for online newspapers. But online\n\nDailies do revolutionize news delivery and its content because of its electronic and digital format. A new marketplace is forged but its potential has not been fully realized. Whether online newspapers would eventually replace the print versions remains an intriguing question for both the academics and the practitioners.\n\n* Key concepts: electronic marketplace, information marketplace, opinion marketplace, virtual media space, media format*\n\n* *Week 10 Social Network Media as News Channels**\n\nIn the past decade, new social network media have become so popular that they also begin to act as news source and serve as a platform for news dissemination. What are their relationships with traditional news organizations? How do they affect the nature, delivery and quality of news? Scholars differentiate the role of traditional journalists as \"gatekeeping\" from the new role of online journalists as \"gatewatching\". Is citizen journalism in the Internet age a blessing or a curse? Would there be generational differences? All these questions will be explored in the course.\n\n* Key concepts: alternative media, Facebook, Twitter, blogging, citizen journalism, gatekeeping, gatewatching*\n\n* *Week 11 News and Advertising: Any Strings Attached with the Money?**\n\nNews and advertising seem to be inseparable worldwide. Journalists work together with advertising and marketing people to bring both news and product information to the readers/audiences. But the journalistic side and the market side of a news organization have different and even opposing ideals and goals. They are in constant battle but have to rely on the other for survival. How can news be immune from unwanted advertising influence? Why is public broadcasting possible but not public print journalism?\n\n* Key concepts: journalistic theory vs. market theory, theory of low involvement, types of advertising, commercialization, sponsorship*\n\n* *Week 12 News and Public Relations: How to Influence the Press**\n\nJournalists and public relations people constitute another pair of actors in constant tension and cooperation. Journalists need news sources and public relations practitioners provide news and information to news organizations. But public relations people are often accused of staging pseudo-events in order to gain publicity and propaganda. They try to influence the press and get coverage. In recent years, many journalists leave the profession and join the public relations field as they know how news work and how to gain press coverage. It is an interesting topic and has major implications for the content and quality of news reporting.\n\n* Key concepts: pseudo-events, staging, manufacturing consent, propaganda model*\n\n* *Week 13 Rethinking News: Professionalism, Ethics, and Alternatives**\n\nThis week is a wrap-up of the course by focusing on media professionalism and ethics. How can journalists do their job properly under all sorts of constraints? Can they adhere to a high standard of media ethics? Can news reflects different perspectives and interests in the society? Is the noble ideal of public journalism a viable alternative? How can news better serve our society and the general public? It is hoped that students will be able to reflect on these questions through the readings and the various assignments in this course.\n\n* Key concepts: journalistic professionalism, media ethics, multi-perspectival news, public journalism*",

      "description": "(UGEC2636 is double-coded with COMM2813.) With the advent of the new media technology, new forms of organizational crisis emerge. They are called Internet-mediated crises. A major difference between the Internet-mediated crises and the traditional crises lies in the intensive interactivity, collectivity, simultaneity and dialogic sphericity of the former. This very nature of Internet-mediated crisis makes it all the more hard to handle. A specialized and critical function of the public relations practice is the management of crisis. This course covers two major levels. The first level takes on a functionalism approach to crisis management. The second level takes on a more critical approach in public relations. Students will learn how crisis reflects complicity and dynamism between citizens and organizations in modern societies. They will acquire an enhanced appreciation of communication that can be brought to bear in such crisis situations and a greater familiarity with the interactivity of an organization and its stakeholders as well as the environments in times of crises. They will also gain more sensitivity in public demands of socially responsible practices in the business contexts.",

      "course_syllabus": "The following is an outline of the course:\n\nWeek 1 Introduction: What is a crisis?\n\nThe course will begin with a question: “what is a crisis?” This is a fundamental question in crisis communication and management because failure in spotting a crisis (i.e., treating a crisis as a regular problem, or vice versa) may bring substantial internal and external threats to the organizations. Several crisis and non-crisis cases will be used for comparisons and discussions. At the end of the class, the students should be able to grasp the core characteristics of a crisis and the types of crisis commonly occurred in modern societies.\n\nKey concepts: Crisis vs. problem, types of crisis, crisis impacts\n\nWeek 2 The stakeholder theory and the four models of public relations\n\nThe class teaches Freeman (1984)’s stakeholder theory. It proffers the students an overview of the scope of the stakeholder groups that an organization may need to handle in crisis communication and communication. It then introduces Grunig and Hunt’s (1984) four models of public relations to give students a framework in viewing the relationships between organizations and stakeholders. Consequences of ignoring these relationships will be examined through the use of real crisis cases.\n\nKey concepts: The stakeholder theory, four models of public relations\n\nWeek 3 The public, the media and the new media\n\nThe class examines the evolution of the public demand and expectation on organizations in general and in times of crisis. The role of the media in shaping public opinion in crisis is also discussed. It also examines the impact of the advent of the new media technology on crisis communication and management. Online public forums on crisis cases will be studied.\n\nKey concepts: The critical mass, the media, the new media, the social media\n\nWeek 4 Blog-related crisis in modern societies.\n\nBlog-related crises include crises initiated or facilitated by personal blogs. The class examines rumor and fact types of blog-related crises. To demonstrate, several recent examples are used illustrate the huge impact of public comments on blogs. Factors that contribute to effective blog-related crisis management are discussed.\n\nKey concepts: blogs, word-of-mouth and blogosphere\n\nWeek 5 and 6 Pre-crisis planning\n\nThe class teaches a crucial stage in crisis management: Pre-crisis alert and planning.\n\nA good pre-crisis preparation may save an organization from a crisis. As such, students will be taught risk assessment, early detection and planning in the pre-crisis stage. Organizational structures and cultures that facilitate down-up reporting are necessary in early detection. Organizations that are particularly prone to crisis will be discussed. The importance of pre-crisis detection on the Internet and tools for monitoring will also be discussed.\n\nKey concepts: pre-crisis stage, crisis planning, risk assessment, organizational structures, organizational cultures\n\nWeek 7 and 8 Crisis communication and management\n\nBenoit’s (1995) image restoration theory and Coombs’ (1999) on-going crisis theory will be used to build theoretical frameworks in conceptualizing crisis communication and management. The class also examines the principles in making news to give students some guidelines about what to say and do in times of crisis, especially upon media enquiry. Good and bad examples of crisis communication management will be used for comparison and contrast.\n\nKey concepts: crisis communication and management, image restoration theory, ongoing crisis, the making of news\n\nWeek 9 and 10 Post-crisis communication\n\nPost-crisis communication is as important as crisis management because it determines how successful an organization is in restoring its image and reputation. It examines what is needed to be done for an organization to rebuild the lost trust. Several crisis cases will be used to investigate this topic. The students will explore on what constitutes a good post-crisis communication in this post-modern era.\n\nKey concepts: post-crisis communication\n\nWeek 11 Guest speaker\n\nAn expert in crisis communication and management will be invited to give a talk to students.\n\nWeek 12 and 13 Corporate social responsibility, sustainability and crisis\n\nThe concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) will be introduced. Cases showing the increased public demand on corporate social responsibility will be presented. The evolution of the concepts of CSR will also be discussed. The class will then examine the relationship between corporate social responsibility and pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis management.\n\nKey concepts: corporate social responsibility, business ethics",

Recognize the impacts of advertising on personal and psychological development.\n\n3. Critically analyze advertising messages and motivations.\n\n4. Investigate beyond the seemingly superficial phenomenon created by advertising into deeper issues related to living attitude and social values.\n\n5. Develop a curiosity towards real life campaigns that promote meaningful causes that benefit citizens in Hong Kong.",
      "course_syllabus": "* *I. SUBLIMINAL PERSUASION**\n\n* *Week** **1****: Subliminal Messaging and** **Materialism**\n\nThis week will introduce briefly all three sections and emphasis more specifically on subliminal persuasion, using materialism, luxury branding in China as examples. China has replaced Japan as the second strongest economic power in the world in 2012. It has also surpassed the US to become the second largest luxury brand market in 2009, spending of $9.4 billion and accounting for 27.5% of total global sales of luxury brands in the world. The invasion of luxury brands will inevitably alter the spending culture in China. Luxury brand ads hint subtly that consumers using them belong to a higher social group in the society. Students will discuss the subliminal indicators of luxury brand ads and their effects on attitudes towards social status in the society.\n\n* *Week** **2****: Commercialization of Friendship in Social Networking Sites**\n\nSocial networking sites are dominating the media landscape among young people. Many viral ads are circulated through the disguise of sincere recommendations from friends, who actually share information for an incentive. This class will look into the core of this issue: should friendship be commercialized for personal gains?\n\n* *Week 3: Properties, Personal Loan Ads and Wealth**\n\nThe recent waves of glamorized Hong Kong properties ads disseminated in China led to grave consequences in raising the prices of flats in Hong Kong. The property ads In Hong Kong shape unrealistic desires in viewers to own a flat that demands a lifetime of hard earned salaries. Personal loan ads encourage a supposedly free life of spending with no responsibility. This lesson will discuss the dynamics of these subliminal messages in affecting one’s decision about how to spend his / her money.\n\n* *Week** **4****: Political Campaigns and Elections**\n\nThe presence of political campaigns in commercial media becomes prevalent these days due to the rise of democratization in the election process. This lesson will look into the various tactics and subliminal strategies used and manipulated in political advertising and its effects on public participation in election.\n\n* *II. MEDIATION OF REALITY**\n\n* *Week** **5****: Beauty Ads and Body Image**\n\nThis lesson will start with an in-depth look at the concept of mediation of reality, using studies conducted in Hong Kong that relate beauty and slimming product / service ads to a negative self-perceived body image in both men and women. Teenagers, in particular, are finding their self in their growing years by comparing themselves to the models in the ads. The gap between the idealized self and actual self creates frustrations among many. To bridge the gap, some fall for crash diets and some for desperate acts of plastic surgeries.\n\n* *Week** **6****: Stereotypical Sex Ads and Gender Roles**\n\nThis lesson looks into the relationship between commoditization and objectification of the body and the resultant stereotypical roles played by men and women. Students will be challenged to live beyond the fixed roles narrowly defined and presented in the pseudo-reality.\n\n* *Week** **7****: Tutor King / Queen Ads and Education**\n\nThe educational system in Hong Kong requires students to acquire incessant training and upgrading. Many tutors chanced this opportunity to create fast track learning to success by advertising their success rate of getting a student to obtain an As. This form of promotion alters students’ mentality to learning. Tutors acting as opinion leaders in ads create a trend of commercialized education.\n\n* *Week** **8**: **A “Copycat” Culture**\n\n“Copycat” China refers not only to the many cases of copying of products but also the imitation of ideas and other intellectual properties in China. Advertising is an industry that is keen on creativity, the very core element that sustains the industry. Piracy will suffocate the creative industry in the long run. Students will scan the creative landscape in China and learn to identify the seemingly original creative reality.\n\n* *III. INFUSION OF CONSTRUCTED MEANINGS**\n\n* *Week** **9****: Freedom of Speech and the Press**\n\nThis class will start examining the idea about meaning and value driven advertising/ advocacy. Recent cases show that advertising is affecting the press in Hong Kong and the Mainland has been censoring a lot of ads online and outdoor. What is the value of commercial speech? How much would the commercial speech be compromised? Will the censorship erode creativity, global branding strategy and business development? Students will investigate the longstanding struggle of the protection of speech in Hong Kong and the mainland.\n\n* *Week** **10****: Globalizing and Standardization**\n\nGlobal brands launched by global advertising agencies bring about their unique culture from the country-of-origin into a foreign country. For a global brand to be successfully adopted by local citizens, the agencies need to accommodate the traditional culture. However, the global influence for standardization sometimes surpasses localization, resulting in a pervasive infusion of foreign values. The balance and consideration of both cultures are the center of discussion in this lesson. A few global campaigns around the world will be presented to demonstrate the delicate balance between globalization and localization.\n\n* *Week 11: “Anti” Campaigns and Social Movements**\n\nThis lesson will look into the value-driven impact and of Public Service Announcements (PSAs), including the anti-smoking, anti-drug and anti-AIDS campaigns on society. The lesson will also focus on the development, planning and execution of those campaigns. It is the purpose of the lesson to raise the awareness of the students in these cause advertising campaigns.\n\n* *Week 12: Earth Hour, Outdoor Light Pollution and other Green Campaigns**\n\nGreenpeace and other environmental protection groups have been working on major campaigns to improve the living conditions of the world. A few successful green campaigns will be discussed in class to reveal their value shifting strategies.\n\n* *Week 1****3****: Food, Drug Ads and Public Health**\n\nWorld Health Organization has established the strong tie between advertising of high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) food and obesity. While UK has exercised blanket ban of food advertising to children and many other countries following suit, the Broadcasting Authority in Hong Kong has only advised five cases in the past four years regarding HFSS food ads to children. This lesson will investigate the difficult path to policy change in the business sector in Hong Kong. Advertising of all medicinal products in Hong Kong is strictly controlled by the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance (Cap 231) (the UMAO). Section 3 of the UMAO provides for an outright prohibition against the publication of 'any advertisement likely to lead to the use of any medicine … for the purpose of treating … or preventing' any disease, disorder or abnormal physical state. However, some prominent direct-to-consumer prescription drug ads are produced and broadcasted in Hong Kong recently. DTC drug advertising will change the traditional beliefs towards doctor-patient relationship and the demand of name-brand drugs at the expense of generic or equally effective drugs. Students will explore the Campaigns of Gardasil and Cervarix to find out their use of Government bodies as façade to lure the public to consult doctors about the drugs.",

This course studies the conditions for producing a particular set of media representation and how it perpetuates the current power structure. How the progressive ideas of sex and violence can enter the social realm of discussion through media representation will also be studied.\n\nThe course explores media representation as a powerful tool in perpetuating certain social reality in the following aspects: (1) it is additive to existing cultural values; (2) it supplements face-to-fact communication; and (3)the representation is monopolized (one-sided). The course also aims to sharpen students' sensitivity to the social reality that media representation of sex and violence as a commercial product is largely an outcome of the reliance of media organizations on advertising money as the funding source. In other words, the imperative of such media representation (a commercial product) is rooted in the particular socio-economic structures of commercial media organization.\n\nThe notion of \"power\" will also be studied in the following aspects: (1) it shapes our understanding of gender roles and \"just\" use of violence; (2) media organization is structurally more resourceful than the audience; (3)media representation of sex and violence is carefully constructed to appear as the \"normal\"/\"natural\"; and (4) the constructive nature of media representation is hidden.\n\n* *Topics**(subject to change by the instructor)\n\nIntroduction and getting to know each other\n\nMedia and Society\n\nWhat's wrong with advertising?\n\nAnything wrong with newspapers?\n\nAesthetics of violence and gender differences\n\nViolence at a distance\n\nSex Industry I-Sex Workers\n\nSex Industry 11-Pornography and Erotica\n\nBeauty is the beast?\n\nMen from Mars, Women from Venus?\n\nGender and Intimate Relationships\n\nWomen are no longer the weaker sex?",

Students will be able to produce a critical film analysis that reflects upon political, social and cultural issues embedded in film texts.",
      "course_syllabus": "The course consists of three main parts: (I) film form and aesthetics (week 1 to 4); (II) two main categories of movies (week 5 and 6); (III) critical theories (week 7 to 12). The first part equips students with specific film languages for film appreciation. The discussion of avant-garde movies and genre draws students’ attention to the dynamics as well as the competition between the two major modes of cultural productions. The last part introduces a variety of critical theories that will lead the understanding of movies to the rethinking of significant issues of human concerns. Key concepts will be introduced so that students can apply them in formulating their film analysis. The sequence of these issues implies a progression of knowledge from film specific to interdisciplinary approach and from film appreciation to critical evaluation.\n\nThe following is an outline of the course:\n\n(1) Introduction: Film Styles: Realism and Formalism\n\nThis lecture will introduce the two major styles of films: realism and formalism. It aims to explain how film is being perceived as an art form and as a representation of reality. The introduction leads students to think of the nature of movie.\n\nKey concept: film style, formalism and realism\n\nMovies: *The Rules of the Game* (1939), *Last Year at Marienbad* (France/Italy 1961),《香港製造》(1997), 《天水圍的日與夜》(2008), 《東邪西毒》(1994),\n\n(2) Film Narrative\n\nThis lecture will talk about how story is being narrated in movies through the elaboration of film structure. The concept of motif is highlighted to direct students to pay attention to how visual elements are contributed to the story telling in movies.\n\nKey words: narrative Structure, story and plot, motifs,\n\nMovies: *Rashomon* (1950), *Confessions* (告白，2011)\n\n(3) Film Style: mise-en-scene\n\nThis lecture will present a major concept used in film appreciation—mise-en- scene. It explains how various visual elements including set design, costume, make-up, framing, cinematography, lighting etc. are articulating the meaning of the movies.\n\nKey word: mise-en-scene\n\nMovies: *The Conformist* (1970), *Clockwork Orange* (1971), *Old Boy* (2003), *the Artist* (2002)\n\n(4) Film Style: Editing and Sound\n\nThis lecture will elucidate how post-production techniques such as editing, sound mixing and music can create meaning. The concepts will be related to the two major film styles of realism and formalism.\n\nKey words: montage, continuity\n\nMovies:*t**he Battleship Potemkin* (1925), *Psycho* (1960), *Godfather* (1972), *Apocalypse Now* (1979), *Run Rola Run* (1998)\n\n(5) Auteur Theory and Avant-garde Movies\n\nAfter introducing basic film languages in the previous lessons, this lecture will introduce auteur theory and avant-garde movies to exemplify movie as art. Auteur theory stresses the importance of understanding movies as imprints of film directors’ aesthetic policy and creative deployment of film languages. The discussion will lead to examination of the nature of avant-garde movie that embraces experimental spirit.\n\nKeywords: auteur theory, avant-garde\n\nMovies: *Meshes of the Afternoon* (1943), *Breathless* (1960), *Kika* (1993), *Volver* (2007)\n\n(6) Film genres and blockbusters\n\nThis lecture introduces the opposite of avant-garde movies – genre movies.

The concept of ideology will be introduced to allow students to critically examine the power relations underpinning film texts. Class and racial stereotypes in movies will be used to demonstrate the ideological contestation and identity politics in movies.\n\nKey Words: Ideology, stereotype\n\nMovies: *Color Purple* (1985), *Titanic* (1997),\n\n(8) Movies: Gender and Sexuality\n\nThis lecture continues the discussion of identity politics by analyzing how gender and sexuality are being represented and constructed in movies. Feminism and queer theory will be introduced not only to address the subject matters but also explain the transformation of film critiques from ideological approach to broader cultural studies of institutions and audiences.\n\nKey concepts: feminism, gender, sexuality, queer theory, camp\n\nMovies: 《金枝玉葉》(1994), *Boys Don’t Cry* (1999)\n\n(9) Movies and the Nation\n\nThis lecture will introduce how the idea of national cinema is expressed and transformed.

      "course_syllabus": "* *Week 1 Phenomena, problems and issues**\n\nIn this introductory class, we will examine a few recent viral cases in social media and discuss two recurring themes, namely convergence and participation, in this course.\n\n* *Week 2 When old media were new…**\n\nIn this class, we will dive into a few key episodes in the history of communication technologies. We will review and discuss how various factors have contributed to the invention and development of communication fads.\n\n* *Week 3 Mediated memories: How we remember and are remembered?**\n\nCommunication technologies have been important memory devices in human history. We will trace how communication technologies co-evolved with memory practices.\n\n* *Week 4 Social media: How we connect and are connected?**\n\nWhat media are not “social media”? Media always facilitate networking in different forms. We will reconsider what differentiates the social media we know of today from previous generations of social media.\n\n* *Week 5 Dating apps and romance**\n\nThe meanings of ‘romance’ and ‘intimacy’ have undergone sweeping changes with the advent of dating apps in smartphones. In this class, we will examine the features of these apps and uncover their assumptions underlying ‘love’.\n\n* *Week 6 MOOC and learning**\n\nMassive Open Online Courses are introducing new forms of teaching, learning and academic accreditation. In a broader sense, how has Internet transformed learning? We will critically evaluate some popular claims in this aspect.\n\n* *Week 7 KOL and public opinions**\n\nKey Opinion Leaders are also known as social influencers or sometimes internet celebrities. They are seen to exert increasing influence in ‘public opinions’ or ‘public sentiments’.　In this class, we will revisit earlier communication theory regarding two-step flow of information and see how Internet has brought new practices in shaping public opinions.\n\n* *Week 8 Streaming media and entertainment**\n\nIn this class, we will focus on the case of streaming media and discuss how entertainment is changed in the Internet era. We will also consider how this in turn affects the production, distribution and consumption of media products.\n\n* *Week 9 - 10 Haters and comment culture**\n\nComment culture is a notable Internet phenomenon. Instead of looking at ‘likes’, we focus on the mechanisms behind ‘dislikes’ and the behaviors of ‘haters’.\n\n* *Week 11 Protest mobilization and social movements**\n\nInternet is seen to be a key factor in protest mobilization. We will examine some key elements in social movements and discuss how social media, for example, have contributed (or not) in the mobilization process.\n\n* *Week 12 Surveillance and sensor society**\n\nThe classic ‘big brother’ thesis is discussed with a careful consideration of many emerging practices in surveillance and self-surveillance. The idea of ‘sensor society’ will be introduced to see how we are (in)voluntarily contributing to a productive surveillance culture.\n\n* *Week 13 Hello future!**\n\nIn this final class, we will reconsider the two central themes of convergence and participation and make both informed and wild guesses for the future.",

These questions are all leading to the re-thinking of significant and recurring issues of public concerns. Key concepts will be introduced so that students can apply them in formulating their own analyses. The class will also study the competing viewpoints, and their justifications, held by different stakeholders. The sequence of these issues implies a progression of knowledge regarding the ten questions to be asked and answered in the course.\n\nThe following is an outline of the course:\n\n(1) Introduction: The formation of Hong Kong Culture, a historical overview\nThe lecture will trace the formation and changes of Hong Kong culture from the 1950s to the 2010s, relating social changes to the cultural changes of audio-visual texts produced in different periods of time. Key concepts will be introduced to help students make sense of cultural patterns as articulated in movies and television programs.\nKey concepts: textuality, contextuality, media representations\n\n(2) The Birth of Hong Kong Man\nThe lecture will focus on the cultural differentiations of mainlanders and Hongkongers in the 1970s. Students will think about the question of why Hong Kong people, mostly ethnic Chinese, saw themselves as a rather different social group of their own. A few classic texts will be used to illustrate the logic of \"othering\" and stigmatizing mainlanders.\nKey concepts: \"other\", cultural imaginations, stigma\n\n(3) New Wave Film and Colonial Politics\nThe lecture will introduce some basic concepts of colonialism. Some mainstream texts will be contrasted with some new wave movies of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some patterns of colonial articulations and de-articulations will be illustrated by these mainstream and new wave productions.\nKey concepts: colonialism, marginality\n\n(4) Political Metaphors in TV and Film\nThe lecture will explain the reasons why there were quite of lot of political metaphors in television and films produced in the 1990s. The relations between political censorship, social anxiety and polysemic articulations will be elaborated with significant cases.\nKey concepts: polysemy, metaphor, censorship\n\n(5) Nonsense and Nostalgia, Remembering and Forgetting\nThe lecture will explain the nature of mediated collective memories and the social functions they perform. The rise of nostalgic texts in the 1990s will be contrasted with the discourses of collective memories in the 2000s.\nKey concepts: nostalgia, collective memories\n\n(6) Urban Space & Postmodern City\nThe lecture will trace the changes in urban representations in films and television from the 1980s up to recent years when discourses concerning urban developments and cultural preservations are competing for public attention.\nKey concepts: urban imaginations, postmodernity, space and place\n\n(7) Media Events: 1997 and 1st July\nThe lecture will introduce the theory of \"media events\" and apply it to major turning points of Hong Kong society such as July 1st in 1997 and 2003, SARS, the Sichuan earthquake, etc. The changes of Hong Kong culture will be examined by looking into the configurations of major media events in recent years.\nKey concepts: media events, social movements\n\n(8) The Rise & Fall of the HK Middle Class\nThe lecture will trace the \"middle class debate\" in the 1980s. Students will be asked to think about their own class positions and how they acquired a class-relevant lifestyle. The changes in media representations of the middle class will be analyzed to see how these representations have become more sophisticated since the 1990s.\nKey concepts: middle class, cultural capitals, taste\n\n(9) Post 97 Hong Kong Culture\nThe lecture will summarize some major changes in Hong Kong cultures after 1997 and contrast these new patterns with the cultural scene before 1997, focusing on the negotiations of local and national identifications.\nKey concepts: re-sinicization, nationalism\n\n(10) Transborder and Transnational Desire\nThe lecture will tell the story of the Hong Kong/Mainland border and the cultural politics it brings to the people on both sides of the border. As cultural differentials have been lowered in recent years, the general categorizations of them and us are replaced by much more complicated transborder collaborations infused with excitements and apprehensions.\nKey concepts: transborder cultural politcs, border, cultural boundaries\n\n(11) Undercover Films: the double identity of Hong Kong\nUsing films featuring under-covered agents, the lecture will talk about the multiple identity of Hong Kong, relating this issue to Hong Kong colonial history and the political structure of one country and two systems.\nKey concepts: collaborative colonialism, instrumental rationality\n\n(12) Orientalism: Hong Kong, Hollywood and Beyond\nThe lecture will use Hong Kong movie star Chow Yuen-fat as a case to examine the rise and changes of Hong Kong culture. The \"star-text\" of Chow will be used to illustrate the effects of Orientalism, comparing Chow's local films and those produced in Hollywood.\nKey concepts: orientalism, star text\n\n(13) The decline of local films and the rise of co-productions\nThe lecture will document the trends of co-productions and examine the effects on the weakening of local representations and the amplifications of national imaginations.\nKey concepts: de-scaling, re-scaling, local scale, national scale",

Using key concepts and theories in mass communication and cultural studies, it discusses the influences and power of mass media with an emphasis on gender-related issues. The latter are in turn related to other social and cultural phenomena that will bring in knowledge and perspectives from other disciplines (e.g. sociology and psychology). The course will examine several recurring controversies related to gender in mass media. These controversies range from representation of sex and gender in media, to the media portrayals of homosexuals and the treatment of taboos. The course will identify and discuss the many competing viewpoints, and the ensuing actions, held by different stakeholders, including media producers, social activists, government regulators, educators and the general audiences. Their implications to legislation and education will also be identified.Students will be able to describe the key characteristics of modern media, in particular their roles in the construction of gender identities and discourses about various gender issues.",

The sequence of these issues implies a progression of knowledge regarding both topics.\n\nThe following is an outline of the course:\n\n* *Week 1 Introduction: The Personal is Political**\n\nThe course will begin with an overview of a feminist statement \"The Personal is Political\". By introducing a special chapter in the feminist movement in the late 1960s, the first lecture invites students to reflect on the agenda of feminists, and connect it to the roles of mass media and individual members in our society. It will also discuss the concept of 'gender' and introduce the six upcoming debates.\n\n* Key concepts: Power of mass media, gender and society, feminism*\n\n* *Week 2 Stereotypes in media: Are stereotypes inherently bad?**\n\nThe meanings of stereotypes and archetypes are defined. The class will trace the birth, development and death of certain stereotypes in media, and from there reflects on the power of mass media.\n\n* Key concepts: Stereotypes, social roles, social typing, media construction of reality*\n\n* *Week 3 and 4 Masculinity and femininity – Can men and women ever be equal?**\n\nThe class discusses the binary oppositions between masculinity and femininity. Social roles, social learning theory and socialization are the relevant key concepts. How discourses about both sexes are formed and acquired will also be discussed. Advertising on slimming (or other gender-related products) and magazines targeting men and women readers will be used for case studies.\n\n* Key concepts: Definitions of masculinity and femininity, socialization, psychoanalysis, media discourses*\n\n* *Week 5 and 6 Sex in the media: Should we ban pornography?**\n\nUsing film excerpts, masterpieces in art history and other examples, students will learn to differentiate between pornography and erotica. The class will discuss the characteristics of pornography as a distinctive type of media genre, which sensitizes the class to the features of mass media. Students will debate for or against legislation against pornography.\n\n* Key concepts: Definitions of pornography, erotica; media genres; legislation against pornography*\n\n* *Week 7 and 8 True love in media: Are stories about true love in media beneficial or harmful to the impressionable minds?**\n\nThe class teaches 'narratives' and examines the structures of popular love stories in films and television. It aims to reveal how media exerts power through reinforcing certain versions of stories and hence ideology.\n\n* Key concepts: Love and relationships in media, media narratives, media ideology*\n\n* *Week 9 and 10 Sexualities in media: Should gays and lesbians be positively represented in media?**\n\nThe class examines the wide spectrum of 'sexualities' in reality, and their portrayals in media. Particular attention will be given to the depiction of homosexuals. The class will learn about the 'semiotic war' waged by social activists in presenting homosexuals in the public. Both the marketing hype and the social movement around homosexuals will be discussed and debated in class.\n\n* Key concepts: Definitions of sexualities, homosexuals, gay rights movement, media construction of homosexuals, hegemonic role of media*\n\n* *Week 11 and 12 Taboos and scandals in media: Are media challenging or reinforcing taboos about sex?**\n\nThe class redefines 'taboos' with references to the roles of mass media. Students will examine how mass media make use of taboos in both fictional and news media. Students will debate whether taboos are challenged or reinforced in today mass media. Students will also study how media use scandals to reaffirm certain moral values in a society.\n\n* Key concepts: Definitions of taboos and scandals, moral panic, media norms*\n\n* *Week 13 Forum: Policy makers, educators, social activists, media producers**\n\nA concluding debate that centers on a current issue",

      "description": "Public relations is often studied and researched from marketing, business, communication management and functionalism perspectives. However, these perspectives do not suffice to understand its role in building, or destroying, trust, social legitimacy and reputation in the era of social media in which a ruthless comment, a 140-word microblog or a casual choice of words might trigger public reprimands and boycotts. As such, public relations should also be examined as a social phenomenon as well as a social activity in its own right and with its societal context. A more extensive use of social theories could help to provide analytical frameworks that highlight the consequences of public relations have for other actors and society as a whole. By applying the work of a group of prominent social theorists including Jürgen Habermas, Niklas Luhmann, Michel Foucault, etc, insights can be garnered for public relations studies at the macro, meso, and micro levels. Issues of how social power, behavior, and language exchanged or negotiated among various social actors in public relations phenomena will be intensively discussed in this course.",
