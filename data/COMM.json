      "description": "In the latter half of the 20th century, working in the media and communication industries referred mainly to working for newspapers, broadcasting stations, film companies, and advertising or PR industries. But with the advance of digital media technologies, old boundaries among the distinctive media sectors are seemingly blurring or even falling apart, while there might also be new types of “media companies.” This course is designed to familiarize students with the evolving realities of the various media industries in Hong Kong, China, and beyond. The overarching questions to be discussed in the class include: How can one characterize the configuration of the contemporary media industries? What are the key trends underlying the transformation of the media industries? What are the implications of these transformations for “media workers”? What does it mean by working as a journalist, a creative content producer, an advertiser, etc. in the contemporary world and in the future? What are the communication practices involved in the various industries? What are the broader social, cultural, and political implications of the transformation of media work and media industries?",

The course is designed around two major themes, namely media and social development in Mainland China since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. Using key concepts and theories from the political economy of media and developmental communication studies, it introduces students to different periods of media reform and social change from the era of Chairman Mao to the period of \"harmonious society\". Emphasis is attached to post-1989 media regulatory systems, media industrialization, and their influence on the meeting of such developmental goals as poverty alleviation, democratization, and communication empowerment.The course will examine Mainland China's key media sectors including the printing press (newspapers and magazines), film and broadcasting media (radio and TV), and new networked communication tools (Internet and mobile phone) as well as alternative social formations through Internet activism, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and transnational developmental projects. The course will identify and discuss several ongoing debates, and the ensuing actions, held by different stakeholders, including governmental officials, media producers, educators, activists, international agencies, and the general audiences. Wider implications to public policy will be identified. There will also be discussions of current affairs related to media and social development in the country.Students will be able to describe the key characteristics of contemporary Mainland Chinese media and their roles in facilitating or obstructing development towards the ideals of a \"new China\".",

To understand the news can essentially help us know our society. Various concepts and theories from the mass communication discipline are introduced together with some perspectives from other social sciences. Real-life examples from Hong Kong and abroad are analyzed.Students are first introduced to the unique nature of news and different types of news as found in both print and electronic media. Some new news formats, including free dailies, online newspapers, network social media and citizen journalism, are discussed in both international and local contexts. Relationships between journalism and closely related professions such as advertising and public relations are explicated in order to understand the actual functioning of news, as well as its impact on society. The professional concerns of the field of journalism and individual’s news consumption habits are also highlighted in the course.After taking this course, students will be able to understand more about news and its relationship with the society. They should be able to critically evaluate news and social phenomena. It is hoped that they can become wise news consumers and well-informed citizens.",

Third, how do media and communication relate to critical issues such as social inequality and social justice? Why might the media be deemed to contribute to certain problems? Many of the theories covered in this course were developed in different traditions which have wide-ranging implications for our understanding of media and communication.",

A major difference between the Internet-mediated crises and the traditional crises lies in the intensive interactivity, collectivity, simultaneity and dialogic sphericity of the former. This very nature of Internet-mediated crisis makes it all the more hard to handle. A specialized and critical function of the public relations practice is the management of crisis. This course covers two major levels. The first level takes on a functionalism approach to crisis management. The second level takes on a more critical approach in public relations. Students will learn how crisis reflects complicity and dynamism between citizens and organizations in modern societies. They will acquire an enhanced appreciation of communication that can be brought to bear in such crisis situations and a greater familiarity with the interactivity of an organization and its stakeholders as well as the environments in times of crises. They will also gain more sensitivity in public demands of socially responsible practices in the business contexts.",

Using key concepts and theories in mass communication and cultural studies, it discusses the influences and power of mass media with an emphasis on gender-related issues. The latter are in turn related to other social and cultural phenomena that will bring in knowledge and perspectives from other disciplines (e.g. sociology and psychology). The course will examine several recurring controversies related to gender in mass media. These controversies range from representation of sex and gender in media, to the media portrayals of homosexuals and the treatment of taboos. The course will identify and discuss the many competing viewpoints, and the ensuing actions, held by different stakeholders, including media producers, social activists, government regulators, educators and the general audiences. Their implications to legislation and education will also be identified.Students will be able to describe the key characteristics of modern media, in particular their roles in the construction of gender identities and discourses about various gender issues.",

      "description": "Public relations is often studied and researched from marketing, business, communication management and functionalism perspectives. However, these perspectives do not suffice to understand its role in building, or destroying, trust, social legitimacy and reputation in the era of social media in which a ruthless comment, a 140-word microblog or a casual choice of words might trigger public reprimands and boycotts. As such, public relations should also be examined as a social phenomenon as well as a social activity in its own right and with its societal context. A more extensive use of social theories could help to provide analytical frameworks that highlight the consequences of public relations have for other actors and society as a whole. By applying the work of a group of prominent social theorists including Jürgen Habermas, Niklas Luhmann, Michel Foucault, etc, insights can be garnered for public relations studies at the macro, meso, and micro levels. Issues of how social power, behavior, and language exchanged or negotiated among various social actors in public relations phenomena will be intensively discussed in this course.",
