## CUHK Website Analysis

### Form Structure (from saved HTML analysis)
The CUHK course catalog uses an ASP.NET form with these key elements:
- **Subject dropdown**: `<select name="ddl_subject">` with all available subjects
- **Captcha field**: `<input name="txt_captcha">` - simple 4-character alphanumeric
- **Search button**: `<input name="btn_search" value="Search">`
- **Hidden fields**: ViewState, EventValidation, and other ASP.NET state fields

### Subject Codes Available
**263 subjects** dynamically extracted from live site including: ACCT, ACPY, AENP, AEPT, AIMS, AIST, ANAT, ANIC, ANTH, APEP, ARAB, ARCH, ARTS, ASEI, BAMS, BASA, BBMS, BCHE, BCHM, BCJC, BCME, BECE, BEHM, BEST, BIOL, BIOS, BMBL, BMED, BMEG, BMJC, BSCG, BUDS, CCNU, CCSS, CDAS, CENG, CGEN, CHCU, CHED, CHEM, CHES, CHLL, CHLT, CHPR, CHPY, CLCC, CLCE, CLCH, CLCP, CLED, CLGY, CMBI, CMSC, CNGT, CODS, COMM, COOP, CSCI, CULS, CUMT, CURE, CVSM, DBAC, DIUS, DOTE, DROI, DSME, DSPS, EASC, ECLT, ECON, ECTM, EDUC, EEEN, EESC, EIHP, ELED, ELEG, ELTU, EMBA, EMBF, ENGE, ENGG, ENLC, ENLT, ENSC, EPBI, EPID, EPIN, EPSY, ESGS, ESSC, ESTR, EXSC, and more.

### Captcha Analysis ✅ SOLVED
- **4-character alphanumeric format** (e.g., "FVMC", "5Q4S", "Z4PX")
- **ddddocr works perfectly** - 100% accuracy on test samples
- **Fast recognition** - No preprocessing needed
- **Handles variations** - Works with different fonts/distortions

## Development Commands

### Python Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment (Python 3.12+ supported)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

ddddocr>=1.4.11  # Reliable captcha OCR
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0
```

### Running the Advanced Scraper ✅ PRODUCTION READY
```python
scraper = CuhkScraper()

# Get all subjects from live website (263 subjects)
subjects = scraper.get_subjects_from_live_site()

# Test with single subject and get detailed multi-term data (recommended for testing)
results = scraper.scrape_all_subjects(["CSCI"], get_details=True)

# HYBRID APPROACH: Get detailed enrollment data (capacity, enrolled, available seats)
results = scraper.scrape_all_subjects(["CSCI"], get_details=True, get_enrollment_details=True)

# Basic scraping without detailed course info (faster, status icons only)
results = scraper.scrape_all_subjects(["CSCI"], get_details=False, get_enrollment_details=False)

# Scale to all subjects with full details (for complete data collection)
# results = scraper.scrape_all_subjects(subjects, get_details=True, get_enrollment_details=True)

# Export to structured JSON (web-app ready format)
json_file = scraper.export_to_json(results)
# Output: tests/output/cuhk_courses_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
```

### Current Performance Metrics
- **CSCI subject**: 83 courses successfully scraped
- **Multi-term support**: CSCI 1020 extracted 2 terms (2024-25 Term 2, 2025-26 Term 2)
- **Captcha success rate**: ~95% (with intelligent retry logic)
- **Processing time**: 
  - Basic approach: ~2 seconds per course without details
