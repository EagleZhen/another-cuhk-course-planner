      "description": "This is a hands-on project-based course which introduces the basic engineering concepts, experimental skills and design methodology needed for the design and construction of a hardware based system. Students will work in small groups on a practical project in which they will apply the design methodology introduced to them in lectures in a design project. The project work will involve defining milestones, identifying the constraints and requirements, defining the requirement specifications of the design, making and evaluating different possible designs by carrying out experiments to obtain data for refining the design, prototyping of the final design and testing of the system built in the project.",

Sequence alignment and assembly: dynamic programming for optimal sequence alignment, FASTA and BLAST for heuristic alignment of long sequences, tree-based methods for multiple sequence alignment, suffix-tree, suffix-array and Burrows-Wheeler Transform for short read alignment, and algorithms based on de Bruijn graphs for sequence assembly 2. Statistical modeling: forward, backward, Viterbi and Baum-Welch algorithms for hidden Markov models, Gibbs sampling for sequence motif discovery, and Bayesian classifiers, logistic regression and expectation-maximization for data classification and clustering3. Phylogenetics: methods based on Jukes-Cantor and Kimura models for divergence time estimation, maximum parsimony, UPGMA, Neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods for phylogenetic tree reconstruction.4. High-throughput data analysis: Hierarchical clustering and k-means for data clustering, and algorithms for selected problems such as signal peak calling, detection of gene fusion, haplotype phasing.Other topics such as RNA secondary structure prediction may also be covered depending on the available time.",

The course will broadly cover topics on wireless networks, Internet, social networks, and network economics. We will introduce various methodologies such as graph theory, optimization theory, game theory, and pricing theory. The intended audience of this course includes undergraduates with majors in Information Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering and Electronic Engineering. It is also suitable for interested undergraduate students from Mathematics, and other Social Science majors.

We start the course by introducing the problem-solving paradigm with deep learning: data preparation, building the model, training the model, model evaluation, and hyper-parameter searching. Then, we fill in the details in the paradigm. Regarding the deep learningmodels, we will go from the simplest linear regression model, towards the relatively complicated models. To handle various data types, that is, the structured data, images, text, sequences, signals, and graphs, in our daily life, we would cover CNN/ResNet, RNN/LSTM, Attention, and GNN models. In addition to the above paradigms, we will also cover the commonly used techniques to handle overfitting. We would briefly go through the generative models, VAE, and GAN, at the end of this course.Advisory: Students are expected to have background knowledge on python programming.",

      "description": "Functional Programming is an important programming paradigm based on lambda-calculus. It has been widely used by many finance and trading companies (e.g., Jane Street) as well as big IT companies (e.g., Google, Facebook). Different from the imperative programming paradigm based on Turing Machines to specify the exact operation in each step, functional programming performs computation through evaluation and composition of expressions. These differences of the underlying computation model lead to many unique features, including algebraic data types, pattern matching, high-order functions, etc., and such features may help developers solve certain computation problems more efficiently. This course will introduce the following core topics about the functional programming paradigm:1. Lambda Calculus2. Data types, such as tuples, lists, records, variants, and algebraic data types3. Pattern matching4. Function as the first-class citizen and high-order functions5. Recursive Function and Tail Recursion6. Modular programming7. Imperative programming inside functional programming8. Advanced functional data types, e.g., hash tables, trees, sequences, monads9. Typical algorithms in functional programming10. Real-world applications of functional programming",
