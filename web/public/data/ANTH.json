It introduces basic concepts and major issues in the areas where the study of gender and the study of kinship intersect through an anthropological lens. Issues to be explored include kinship structures and related gender roles in cross-cultural perspective, the changing relationship between marriage and love, and the various new ways of people “doing” kinship in contemporary societies and the emerging social problems resulted from these changes. Themes such as kinship and the new reproductive technologies, fictive kinship and human-pet bond will all be discussed.",

Underlying most topics are questions of the modern versus the traditional, rural versus urban, cosmopolitan versus parochial, and how all these opposites interact to construct culture in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has been developed at a rapid pace since WWII. This course also discusses to what extent the development in Hong Kong meets the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular in the area of gender equality, cultural inclusiveness, and socially responsible production and consumption.",

How do childhood experiences affect people and shape or even determine what kinds of persons they will become? What is it like to be mentally abnormal or even pathological? Do people in different cultures or societies experience, understand, and treat psychopathology in different ways? This course examines psychological experiences—feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and motivations—from social and cross-cultural perspectives. It sets out to explore the intersection between anthropology, a field that typically turns to the exotic other, and psychology, a field that often takes the universality of mental activities and mechanisms for granted. Specific focus is placed upon how ethnographers, clinicians, and researchers with training in both fields grapple with various mental phenomena and different ways of understanding them. As most of the materials are drawn from psychological anthropology, this course also serves as an eclectic introduction to this subfield, which was once influential in the history of American anthropology.",

It is one of the world’s powers with global economic, political, and intellectual influence. Moreover, it shares important ties in the sphere of philosophy, religion, and medicine with China and other Asian societies. Therefore, students will learn about India’s place both in the world and the Asian region, including its ties with Hong Kong. Students will also develop an understanding of the country’s diversity and complex social phenomena such as kinship, communalism, caste system, tribe, third gender, and class. We will discuss pressing issues and theoretical debates related to globalization, sexuality, social movements, religious conflicts, public health, environment, and labor, and how these issues have been shaped by post-colonial politics and current transnational processes.",

      "description": "(UGEC2657 is double-coded with ANTH2327.) This course provides an introduction to contemporary Japanese society and culture. In the popular imagination, Japan occupies a complex and often contradictory position. It is home to futuristic anime and an aging population, picturesque villages and dolphin hunts, high-end cameras and the widespread use of quaint fax machines. Engaging with anthropological literature, students will learn to analyze, discuss, and write about various issues and cultural features of Japan, including youth, popular culture, self, family, labor, medicine, and health. An overarching theme will be how Japanese culture and society is changing in the transition to a highly aged society. We will examine persistent cultural patterns as well as the emergence of new forms of social life as residents of Japan grapple with smaller families, precarity, migration, and a rising population of older people. Students will learn how to apply theoretical concepts from anthropology and think critically about Japanese culture and its portrayals in the media. The ethnographic approaches and theoretical perspectives covered in this class will be applicable to other cultural contexts. Since Hong Kong, China, and Korea are following Japan’s path of population aging, this course provides an opportunity to explore cultural issues that have a local and regional significance.",

Dealing with death, both practically and psychologically, is something that all humans must face. This course examines death and death ritual through the question of what is universal and what is culturally variant about how humans face death. It looks at death and death ritual in both modern and pre-modern contexts and analyses it socially, psychologically, politically, and culturally. From the course students will learn how the treatment of death varies cross-culturally; how understandings of death have shifted over human cultural evolution; what aspects of death are universal in human experience; and how death affects contemporary politics, economics, and culture.",

      "description": "(UGED2666 is double-coded with ANTH2360.) This course introduces students to the study of morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself. This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways. The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues. Students will be invited to conduct research into the mundane things ordinary people do to take care of one another in daily life.",

In order to maintain this image for its world visitors, there is no doubt that Hong Kong needs to find a balance between its global metropolitan aspect and unique cultural heritage with local characteristics in many ways. Yet, before moving on for extensive intangible heritage preservation, we might want to think about: What kind of heritage do we want to pass down to the coming generations? What kind of long-term policy do we have? How should the intangible heritage preservation and management be carried out? In this course, different types of intangible heritage in Hong Kong will be introduced and explained, and students will be guided to discuss and rethink the use and meanings of heritage from a socio-cultural anthropological perspectives.",

Through the lens of environment, we bring human diversity into presence, examining ways of life of peoples—from Indonesia highlander to Tokyo urbanites—and their words and deeds to tackle crises of planetary scale—climate change, nuclear disaster, air pollution, waste, deforestation. Facing these crises, can anthropological inquiry of the environment help us to explore a humanity that can accommodate living beings of all kind? How can such inquiry inspire us to make changes that create a world we can live together? We’ll follow these trails in the environment to look for engagement and conversation: cultural perception on the origin of agriculture, resource use and religious belief, debating traditional ecological knowledge, globalization and state intervention, environmental justice, land dispossession, waste and pollution, disaster and extreme environment. Through ethnographies of people who are struggling to survive, this course asks why they are pushed into poverty, how their resources being exploited, what they do to fight for justice; it covers SDGs related to the issues of sustainable agriculture (SDG2), tacking climate change (SDG13) and promoting peace, justice and institutional accountability (SDG16).",

      "description": "(UGEC2664 is double-coded with ANTH2390.)This course will examine the role and importance of sports in different societies and cultures, in the present and the past. Sports are often thought of as trivial, or as unimportant games to amuse young people. But in the wealthiest countries, sports represent huge portions of GDP and are important topics of daily conversation. Almost half the world watched the 2010 football/soccer World Cup. Sports have been compared to religions in their ability to unite people and to inspire fanatical devotion.The academic study of sports is interdisciplinary, with contributions from psychologists, historians, gender studies scholars, sociologists and anthropologists. This course will take an interdisciplinary approach while emphasizing anthropology’s focus on culture, on the experience of participants, and on both symbolic and political-economy aspects of sports. Topics will include Race and Performance, Sports and Rituals, Sports as Moral Education, Gender and Sexuality in Sport, Sports and Nationalism, Globalization of Sport, the Olympics, and Sports Stars and the Media. Students will be expected to do a research project for the course.",

Some of the key questions we raise include: What does it mean to be Chinese? What role does culture play in being Chinese, and what constitutes Chinese society? Our emphasis is on the dominant cultural practices of societies around the world that render them ‘Chinese’. The course will also situate contemporary China historically within the world-system and examine the dramatic transformations it has undergone as a result of the post-Mao reforms beginning in the late-1970s. Because China has become the world’s most dynamic growth-engine since these reforms were launched, the Chinese experience offers itself as a case-study of the benefits as well as challenges thrown up by modern development. Since China has committed to implementing the 2030 development agenda, including Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as clean water, affordable clean energy, and climate action, this course will offer students the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the discourse of sustainability as articulated by the SDGs. But more than that, with specific reference to the experience of the People’s Republic of China in particular, the course will afford students the opportunity to reflect upon the apparent contradictions existing between what is understood to be ‘development’ on the one hand and ‘sustainability’ on the other.",

      "description": "(UGEA2332 is double-coded with ANTH2420.) The remarkable economic emergence of China and Asia more broadly in recent decades has transformed many impoverished and largely agriculturally based societies into the most dynamic region of the contemporary world. China’s burgeoning aspirational middle classes, rapid urbanisation, time-space compression and the shift from command economies to de-regulated markets have had profound effects on people's everyday lives and the diverse cultural practices that have long shaped local livelihoods and community expectations. This course offers an introduction into anthropological approaches to the study of culture, modernity and globalisation in China and Asia more broadly. Relevant themes that have attracted anthropological interest include changing traditions and popular culture, adaptive custom and cosmopolitanism, migration and citizenship, identity politics and social movements as well as distinctive and emergent forms of governance in both collective and self-cultivating forms of expression. Drawing on a rich corpus of social theory and ethnographic research from anthropologists past and present, the course will provide students with conceptual and analytical tools to appreciate adaptive cultural practices in comparative terms, to review and appreciate the key anthropological debates and influential works in the study of modernity, and to introduce students to ethnographic approaches for researching and writing on modernity and contemporary ethnographies of global connection.",

This course will examine the role of culture in contemporary business and study work and management in industrial societies anthropologically. Students will be introduced to the cultural logics of business practices, particularly business operations, organization and management through ethnographic explorations of different cultures, locales and sociohistorical settings. The aims of the course are twofold. First, it reveals cultural aspects and the cultural mechanisms of business. It shows the significance of culture in the business world, as well as the cultural significance of business. Second, it attempts to put anthropology into business practice. It demonstrates to students how anthropological knowledge and methodologies can be applied to business operations and help to achieve business goals. By examining the themes including but not limited to the indoctrination of work ethics, labor relations, gender and racial issues in the workplace, capitalism and its discontents, and responses to and actions upon market capitalism in terms of both production and consumption, the course attends to these Sustainable Development Goals: No Poverty (SDG#1), Gender Equality (SDG#5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG#10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG#17).",

Globalization is economically transforming the world, as national borders become increasingly irrelevant before the global flow of money and goods. But globalization also has a great impact on cultures across the globe, as products from Coca-Cola to iPods, and ideas from human rights to ideals of beauty to ideologies of terrorism, intrude everywhere. This course examines how globalization is fundamentally transforming the meanings of culture. The course objectives are to enable students: (1) to have greater insight into the processes of “the globalization of culture\"”, and (2) to better understand the nature of their own culture and selves within a globalizing world.",

Violence is always political – whether it is manifest in the spectacular practices of torture, terrorism, or genocide, or the invisible structures of inequalities that generate educational, health, and food inequities. Specifically, we will address four SDG goals in depth: SDG#1 No Poverty, SDG #5 “Gender Equality”, SDG# 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG #10 “Reduced Inequalities” and SDG #16 “Peace, Justice and strong institutions”; The topics covered will be understood in relation to histories of colonialism and nationalism, ideologies about race, gender, and variant forms of social, economic, and political hierarchies. We further examine the effectiveness and limitations of human rights and humanitarianism as remedies, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",

This course addresses the ways in which social media and other related interactions in cyberspace have become a central element in the everyday lives of humans across the globe in the 21st Century. Our modern lives are now largely interwoven with digital technologies that have not only changed our own cultures, but also have brought forth new cultural forms through mobile phone technologies, networked “smart”-products, and cultural groupings only possible through digital means. The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes—the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives. The role of anthropology in understanding and capturing human culture in this context anchors on the investigation of how technology is possibly making us ‘more’ human than previous forms of cultural life.",

We will further explore how current social, technological, and cultural transformations of work can be understood across places, in their historic continuities and disruptions. Each week the course analyzes, discusses, and rethinks a key concept in the anthropology of work: Class, time, race, gender, value, craft, ownership, creativity, autonomy, discipline, etc. Through reading contemporary ethnographies of different workplaces and circumstances, students will learn the analysis and theory of work in familiar or unexpected forms, as well as in different organizational settings from the office, factory, workshop, home, to online platforms. This course will further give the students the tools to systematically connect their own observations of work to writing about working cultures.",

Archaeology is a dynamic discipline that has tremendously expanded our knowledge about the past, but this subject is not just about digging and doing fieldwork. A wide range of new techniques (e.g., metallurgy, zoology, and 3d stimulation) and research methods have been incorporated into current archaeological research, and eventually transformed the understanding of ourselves and our culture in many ways. This course provides a general introduction in terms of two specific domains: 1) basic archaeological science that changed the research paradigm of human culture and history; 2) an overall history about ancient technology illustrated by new research techniques to explain how this modern world took shape. Moreover, this course provides hands-on practice to cultivate students’ cross-disciplinary research skills and prepare them for the arrival of a new, digitalized research era.",

      "description": "(UGEB2502 is double-coded with ANTH2810.)  What does it mean to be human? Where did we come from? Where are we going? This course investigates long-term evolutionary perspectives on the human species. The basics of evolution and natural selection as scientific theories are clearly set out and examined, and common misconceptions discussed. Evidence for the evolution of mammals and primates is reviewed and discussed, and the common characteristics of these species are highlighted, demonstrating the connections between humans and other forms of life. The course covers what we know about human ancestors and the evolution of modern humans. Students are introduced to the wide range of human adaptations to local conditions across contemporary cultures and the variety of relationships that human populations have with the environment. Students are encouraged to use the knowledge they have acquired to ask: are these relationships always sustainable? Looking to the future: what are our responsibilities both to future generations of humans and towards other species with which we share our world? This course aims to give students an understanding and appreciation of evolutionary perspectives on the place of humans in the world, the variety of contemporary human societies, and a broad perspective on the complexity of the relationship between humans, the environment and other species.",

This course examines the following aspects of religion: magic and sorcery, symbolism and ritual, gender and religion, shamanism, syncretism, and social change driven by religious ideas. The course also introduces major traditions of social theory: each tradition offers a different way of looking at the role of religion in people's lives. This course thus introduces students to various forms of religious expression around the world and also exposes them to different interpretations of religion.",

      "description": "This course explores the relations between the body, love, and emotions from an anthropological perspective. People acquire a special sense of presence, knowledge, and power from the brute fact of their bodies as sentient, sensuous, instinctual, habitual, feeling, and erotic organisms. At the same time, this special presence has made the materiality of the body a contested site for representational practices and politics in which love and emotions have figured centrally. Through an ethnographic focus on cross-cultural studies of love and emotions, this course seeks to juxtapose and reconcile the body's manifold facets as materiality and representation, subject and object. We will address the following questions: What are the culturally differentiating politics and poetics of the seemingly universal emotion of love? What conceptions of the body and personhood do they articulate? How do modern notions of love and desire underscore changing gender relations, sexual identities, and embodied ideals of masculinity and femininity? How do affect and embodiment intersect with the problems of class, race, ethnicity, and nationality?",

The study of disability from an anthropological perspective is in fact a study of difference, that is, how categories of difference are made and experienced. In what contexts does bodily, neurological or cognitive difference become a problem to be solved, managed, or eradicated? How do local ideas about personhood and the good life shape the way people in different societies understand disability, impairment, and debility? What does the lived experience of disability reveal about the human condition? The study of disability from an anthropological perspective is never merely a study of a medically defined deficit. It leads instead to questions about how politics, economics, policies, social practices, moral values and the potential for human flourishing and community are co-constituted. Like other categories of difference, disability provides an occasion for questioning the normative and the hegemonic. Unlike other categories of difference, disability is a form of otherness anyone could enter into at any time.",

However, the need to adapt to different ecological, political and socio-cultural environments calls for adaptation and transformation. Thus the diverse Chinese communities worldwide are ideal for comparative studies, especially on a number of anthropological/ sociological themes such as cultural continuity and transformation, cultural identities and ethnic identities, ethnic relations, social organization, and so on.",

Students will form small groups to investigate different anthropological topics within the field site, actually “doing” anthropology!Open only to anthropology majors or minors, including minors in archaeology and in cultural heritage studies. The contents of this course will vary with different instructors and students.

Premised on a social constructivist understanding of gender and sexuality, the course aims to provide a set of tools for students to understand and analyze the norms and frameworks regulating human sexuality through the law. The course further locates the making of gender and sexuality in the law within histories of colonialism and imperialism. Students will learn to evaluate different legislative and judicial responses to issues directly related to sexuality such as consent, rape and adultery, prostitution and human trafficking, violence against women, homosexuality, same-sex and heterosexual marriage etc. They will also learn to examine how legal regulation of gender and sexuality extends into other areas of the law about urban space, inheritance, citizenship, immigration and asylum, as well as the prison system. The course aims at providing students with the critical tools to analyze the cultural and historical constructions that inform “laws in the books, laws in the mind, and laws in action.”",

It explores sociolinguistics — how linguistic behaviour is shaped by sociocultural factors — and also metaphor, and the problems of cultural interpretation and translation. It also examines a range of symbols in society, the language not just of words but of clothing, material goods, popular culture and political discourse, to understand how cultural symbols are socially constructed, performed and contested. Language and symbols and their social uses form a central topic of anthropological inquiry; this course will explore and explicate this topic.",

      "description": "Landscape is a reflection of past interactions between people and their physical environment, which cumulatively create highly recognizable and culturally distinctive places. Such unique and geographically-defined records of particular groups and their way of life are what UNESCO calls “cultural landscapes” (Rössler 2006). Landscapes also reflect and embody intangible beliefs and if we are to understand such ‘non-material’ meanings we must embrace both Western and non-Western (e.g. Chinese) approaches to their study. Hong Kong’s cultural landscape is overwhelmingly urban and modern in character, embedded within, beyond and beneath the city lie other ‘hidden’ landscapes reflecting more ancient belief systems and traditional practices such as agrarian and maritime lifeways and their ‘traditional’ belief systems. Also, Hong Kong has many culturally important ‘ephemeral’ landscapes, relating to the temporary transformation of spaces, for example during religious festivals, or even the more routine transformations that occur at street eateries (dai pai dong) or markets. This course explores the concept “landscape”, its tangible and intangible dimensions, how they are physically evidenced locally and abroad, and how anthropologists, archaeologists and a myriad of other disciplines approach their study and interpretation. In particular, we will work through a series of local case studies to see what landscape can tell us about the lifeways, economies, politics and beliefs of past and present communities in Hong Kong. By studying cultural landscapes we can also identify what past and present communities, organisations and governments chose to keep and protect and what they let go – by assessing such processes we can develop an understanding of the underlying socio-political and economic drivers at work through time. In terms of heritage management, therefore, if we wish to militate against the gradual loss of meaning and value in our cultural landscapes, a landscape approach is indicated.",

The field study trip will consist of both supervised student-led field research and formal face-to-face teaching including such things as guest lectures with local experts, formal professor-guided class discussions on methodology and archaeological fieldwork, guided museum tours, and local study tours focused on the cultural, political, and economic lives of local people. Students will form small groups to investigate different archaeological topics within the field site, actually “doing” archaeology!Open only to anthropology majors or minors, including minors in archaeology and in cultural heritage studies. The contents of this course will vary with different instructors and students.

Topics include the definition of the museum, and analyses of the museum’s history and functions, with special emphasis on introducing how a museum is run, and the technical issues of how the artifacts and information are restored, preserved and displayed. Excursions will be made to selected museums in Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong for observation and discussion purposes.",

      "description": "Death is both a human universal and a process deeply affected by the cultural context in which it occurs. Dealing with death, both practically and psychologically, is something that all humans must face. This course examines death and death ritual through the question of what is universal and what is culturally variant about how humans face death. It looks at death and death ritual in both modern and pre-modern contexts and analyses it socially, psychologically, politically, and culturally. From the course students will learn how the treatment of death varies cross-culturally; how understandings of death have shifted over human cultural evolution; what aspects of death are universal in human experience; and how death affects contemporary politics, economics, and culture.",

      "description": "How can we understand the minds of other people? Do people in different cultures or societies feel and think in different ways? How do childhood experiences affect people and shape or even determine what kinds of persons they will become? What is it like to be mentally abnormal or even pathological? Do people in different cultures or societies experience, understand, and treat psychopathology in different ways? This course examines psychological experiences—feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and motivations—from social and cross-cultural perspectives. It sets out to explore the intersection between anthropology, a field that typically turns to the exotic other, and psychology, a field that often takes the universality of mental activities and mechanisms for granted. Specific focus is placed upon how ethnographers, clinicians, and researchers with training in both fields grapple with various mental phenomena and different ways of understanding them. As most of the materials are drawn from psychological anthropology, this course also serves as an eclectic introduction to this subfield, which was once influential in the history of American anthropology.",

India is home to more than a billion people, who look differently, speak various languages, practice different religions, and have distinct rituals, cuisines, and music. It is one of the world’s powers with global economic, political, and intellectual influence. Moreover, it shares important ties in the sphere of philosophy, religion, and medicine with China and other Asian societies. Therefore, students will learn about India’s place both in the world and the Asian region, including its ties with Hong Kong. Students will also develop an understanding of the country’s diversity and complex social phenomena such as kinship, communalism, caste system, tribe, third gender, and class. We will discuss pressing issues and theoretical debates related to globalization, sexuality, social movements, religious conflicts, public health, environment, and labor, and how these issues have been shaped by post-colonial politics and current transnational processes.",

It is home to futuristic anime and an aging population, picturesque villages and dolphin hunts, high-end cameras and the widespread use of quaint fax machines. Japan also has a long and deep relationship with China, Korea, and other Asian societies. Engaging with anthropological literature, students will learn to analyze, discuss, and write about various issues and cultural features of Japan. Particular attention will be paid to youth, popular culture, family organization, labor, medicine, health, and the transition to a highly aged society. We will examine persistent cultural patterns as well as the emergence of new forms of social life. Students will learn how to apply theoretical concepts from anthropology and think critically about Japanese culture and its portrayals in the media. The ethnographic approaches and theoretical perspectives covered in this class will be applicable to other cultural contexts.",

People acquire a special sense of presence, knowledge, and power from the brute fact of their bodies as sentient, sensuous, instinctual, habitual, feeling, and erotic organisms. At the same time, this special presence has made the materiality of the body a contested site for representational practices and politics in which love and emotions have figured centrally. Through an ethnographic focus on cross-cultural studies of love and emotions, this course seeks to juxtapose and reconcile the body's manifold facets as materiality and representation, subject and object. We will address the following questions: What are the culturally differentiating politics and poetics of the seemingly universal emotion of love? What conceptions of the body and personhood do they articulate? How do modern notions of love and desire underscore changing gender relations, sexual identities, and embodied ideals of masculinity and femininity? How do affect and embodiment intersect with the problems of class, race, ethnicity, and nationality?MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper.",

Ethics and morality may appear to be an abstract subject for philosophers, but this course shall demonstrate how they are in fact a close part of our everyday lives. Human beings living in different societies have different ideas about what constitutes the good and the right. How and why do they differ? Does the cross-cultural study of morality and ethics lead to moral relativism? What are some shared human problems? How do people manage to get along with each other, and how does a person learn to get along with oneself? “Ethics and the Human Experience” will prioritize context in understanding what shapes the good and the right. But ultimately, the class aims to expand our moral imagination beyond the usual concerns, and to more deeply understand the human experience.",

The study of disability from an anthropological perspective is in fact a study of difference, that is, how categories of difference are made and experienced. In what contexts does bodily, neurological or cognitive difference become a problem to be solved, managed, or eradicated? How do local ideas about personhood and the good life shape the way people in different societies understand disability, impairment, and debility? What does the lived experience of disability reveal about the human condition? The study of disability from an anthropological perspective is never merely a study of a medically defined deficit. It leads instead to questions about how politics, economics, policies, social practices, moral values and the potential for human flourishing and community are co-constituted. Like other categories of difference, disability provides an occasion for questioning the normative and the hegemonic. Unlike other categories of difference, disability is a form of otherness anyone could enter into at any time.",

      "description": "The remarkable economic emergence of China and Asia more broadly in recent decades has transformed many impoverished and largely agriculturally based societies into the most dynamic region of the contemporary world. China’s burgeoning aspirational middle classes, rapid urbanisation, time-space compression and the shift from command economies to de-regulated markets have had profound effects on people's everyday lives and the diverse cultural practices that have long shaped local livelihoods and community expectations. This course offers an introduction into anthropological approaches to the study of culture, modernity and globalisation in China and Asia more broadly. Relevant themes that have attracted anthropological interest include changing traditions and popular culture, adaptive custom and cosmopolitanism, migration and citizenship, identity politics and social movements as well as distinctive and emergent forms of governance in both collective and self-cultivating forms of expression. Drawing on a rich corpus of social theory and ethnographic research from anthropologists past and present, the course will provide students with conceptual and analytical tools to appreciate adaptive cultural practices in comparative terms, to review and appreciate the key anthropological debates and influential works in the study of modernity, and to introduce students to ethnographic approaches for researching and writing on modernity and contemporary ethnographies of global connection.",

Thus the diverse Chinese communities worldwide are ideal for comparative studies, especially on a number of anthropological/sociological themes such as cultural continuity and transformation, cultural identities and ethnic identities, ethnic relations, social organization, and so on.

But globalization also has a great impact on cultures across the globe, as products from Coca-Cola to iPods, and ideas from human rights to ideals of beauty to ideologies of terrorism, intrude everywhere. This course examines how globalization is fundamentally transforming the meanings of culture.

      "description": "This course examines the problem of violence and its political uses from an anthropological and comparative perspective. The range of phenomena that can be called violent is very broad. We focus here on the state and human rights and the ways various state and non-state actors promote their political goals through violent means. We will also examine the cultural issues involving human rights (such as human rights as a universal value and the issue of cultural relativism) and analyze the discourses and practices of human rights as politics, and what these new forms of political authority may entail. MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper.",

      "description": "This course will be a cross-cultural and historical study of the contexts in which gender and sexuality are articulated and contested in law. Premised on a social constructivist understanding of gender and sexuality, the course aims to provide a set of tools for students to understand and analyze the norms and frameworks regulating human sexuality through the law. The course further locates the making of gender and sexuality in the law within histories of colonialism and imperialism. Students will learn to evaluate different legislative and judicial responses to issues directly related to sexuality such as consent, rape and adultery, prostitution and human trafficking, violence against women, homosexuality, same-sex and heterosexual marriage etc. They will also learn to examine how legal regulation of gender and sexuality extends into other areas of the law about urban space, inheritance, citizenship, immigration and asylum, as well as the prison system. The course aims at providing students with the critical tools to analyze the cultural and historical constructions that inform “laws in the books, laws in the mind, and laws in action.”",

Each week the course is structured to explore, discuss, and rethink a key concept in the anthropology of work: Class, time, race, gender, value, craft, ownership, creativity, autonomy, discipline, etc. By learning through contemporary ethnographies of different places and circumstances, students will gain the tools to connect observation, analysis, writing and theory to explore work in familiar or unexpected forms, as well as in different organizational settings from the office, into the home and onto social media platforms.",

Language and symbols and their social use form a central topic of anthropological inquiry; this course explores and explicate this topic. Students engage in intensive readings, and write extended essays tying the content of the course to their own interests in language.",

Today museums are relevant to many fields such as education, science, culture, tourism and environmental protection, thus museums play important roles in contemporary societies. Topics include the definition of the museum, and analyses of the museum’s history and functions, with special emphasis on introducing how a museum is run, and the technical issues of how the artifacts and information are restored, preserved and displayed. Excursions will be made to selected museums in Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong for observation and discussion purposes. MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper. (Not for students who have taken ANT4720.)",

      "description": "Landscape is a reflection of past interactions between people and their physical environment, which cumulatively create highly recognizable and culturally distinctive places. Such unique and geographically-defined records of particular groups and their way of life are what UNESCO calls “cultural landscapes” (Rössler 2006). Landscapes also reflect and embody intangible beliefs and if we are to understand such ‘non-material’ meanings we must embrace both Western and non-Western (e.g. Chinese) approaches to their study. Hong Kong’s cultural landscape is overwhelmingly urban and modern in character, embedded within, beyond and beneath the city lie other ‘hidden’ landscapes reflecting more ancient belief systems and traditional practices such as agrarian and maritime lifeways and their ‘traditional’ belief systems. Also, Hong Kong has many culturally important ‘ephemeral’ landscapes, relating to the temporary transformation of spaces, for example during religious festivals, or even the more routine transformations that occur at street eateries (dai pai dong) or markets. This course explores the concept “landscape”, its tangible and intangible dimensions, how they are physically evidenced locally and abroad, and how anthropologists, archaeologists and a myriad of other disciplines approach their study and interpretation. In particular, we will work through a series of local case studies to see what landscape can tell us about the lifeways, economies, politics and beliefs of past and present communities in Hong Kong. By studying cultural landscapes we can also identify what past and present communities, organisations and governments chose to keep and protect and what they let go – by assessing such processes we can develop an understanding of the underlying socio-political and economic drivers at work through time. In terms of heritage management, therefore, if we wish to militate against the gradual loss of meaning and value in our cultural landscapes, a landscape approach is indicated.",

The course covers what we know about human ancestors and the evolution of modern humans. Students are introduced to the wide range of human adaptations to local conditions across contemporary cultures and the variety of relationships that human populations have with the environment. Students are encouraged to use the knowledge they have acquired to ask; are these relationships always sustainable? Looking to the future; what are our responsibilities both to future generations of humans and towards other species with which we share our world?

This course will introduce students to the field of forensic anthropology – a scientific discipline that involves the application of methods from biological anthropology and archaeology to the identification, recovery, and analysis of skeletal remains from crime scenes, mass disasters, and unexplained death. Through lectures and in-class assignments, students will learn about the methods for recognizing and recovering evidence that allows for the determination of time since death, manner and cause of death, and the identification of individuals.",
