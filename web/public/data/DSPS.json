In addition, the challenges of other discoveries such as open data, open innovation, and AI, for government and society would also be examined.\n\nBig Data and Policymaking\n\nOpen Data and Open Innovation\n\nAI and the Future of Work\n\nData Science and State Surveillance\n\n* *Part III: Technology and Societal Impact**\n\nThis section would discuss how data connectivity enabled by information and communication technologies (ICT) affects social and political lives. For example, smart city is a city that uses ICT to increase operational efficiency, share information with the public and improve both the quality of government services and citizen welfare. We would identify the issues and factors dividing the success and failure in the adoption and effects of those technologies.\n\nSmart City\n\nSocial Media and Society\n\nSocial Media and Governance\n\nDesign Thinking and Public Participation",

      "description": "This course aims to provide students with knowledge, skills and applications of collaborative governance in a rapidly changing globalized world. Collaborative governance is broadly defined as the processes and structures of public policy decision making and management that engage people constructively across the boundaries of public, private and civic society for a public purpose that could not otherwise be accomplished. With the increasingly limited role of government in governance, the ability of policymakers to collaborate with non-state actors across levels and boundaries becomes critical for addressing policy challenges. The course focuses on how collaborative governance can build consensus and deliberative purposes of public policy and governance through studying its formats, process, rationales, concepts and outcomes as well as evaluation of its effectiveness and dilemma. The course also intends to nurture students to have a responsible and reflective role in society and to pursue a better governance.",

Advance in data science radically transforms the way data can be handled and utilized, and inevitably generates new regulatory concerns and debates due to the clash of competing values and interests.

Leadership provides social source of influence and vision that one uses to inspire action taken by others, and to mobilize others to achieve a common goal. Entrepreneurship is the recognition of opportunities by coupling needs, wants, resources, and problems with innovative solutions and make changes to society. With a workshop format, the course provides students more interactive experience to equip them with the mindset, skills, and strategies of policy leadership and entrepreneurship. Policy leaders and entrepreneurs will be invited to serve as guest speakers in order to offer students the opportunities to learn from their practical experience.",

It is recommended that the internship to be conducted in summer holiday, i.e. June to August, after finishing year two studies in the block mode (i.e. 5 days x 8 hours).\n\nDSPS Programme will deploy work units, agencies, or organizations that provide internships relevant to the general course objectives. Meanwhile, students are encouraged to explore opportunities of internship to fit their own specific learning needs. However, all self-selected internship must comply with the course requirements, and subjected to the approval of DSPS Programme Director. Guidance and assistance will be provided whenever appropriate.\n\nDuring the internship, each student would be guided and assisted by an academic supervisor. The supervisor offers advice and help whenever necessary during the attachment period. At the same time, each student will be receiving guidance and assistance from his/her agency supervisor. Students will submit self-evaluation report to reflect on the experience in the internship. Academic advice will be provided to help students consolidate their learning in the internship.",
