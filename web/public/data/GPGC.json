As the only region without a regional human rights regime, Asia has relied more completely on domestic constitutionalism and legislative enactment to articulate and implement human rights commitments. This has often made the human rights debate a matter of local politics. In this respect, China has had a noteworthy engagement with some of the central themes in the human rights debate, relating human rights to culture, to the political economy of development, democratization, international relations, and civil society. The course will explore these rich Chinese themes and efforts.*Teachers will have the freedom to provide detailed descriptors for each individual assessment of the course when they offer it.",

They need to help people understand complex public policy questions and solutions. They need to rally people to support certain courses of actions. And most important, they need to convince the voters in order to get elected and remain in power. To achieve these, effective communication is very important. This course aims at introducing students the basic theories and practices of political communication. It would explore the ways in which political messages are sent and received so that students can better understand how their lives are shaped, and then have a better reflection of real life politics. Moreover, while political communication becomes a rising profession, this course can provide a basic training to those students who want to begin their careers in this field.",
