How do children acquire and express these emotions, and how do they affect child development? This course covers a wide range of theories, perspectives, and practices on the social and emotional development of children from infancy through the sixth year, with particular focus on family, schools, and culture as sources of socialization. Special attention will be given to the practical implications of the related behavioural and emotional problems often found among school children. These include aggression, social anxiety, oppositional behaviour, and other internalizing and externalizing difficulties. These topics will be presented with a practical focus on helping children with these and other social-emotional problems.",

On top of designing, implementation and evaluating the integrated activities for young children, students are required to conduct their classroom teaching through observation, assessment and reflection. In this course, the rationale of “assessment inform teaching” is highlighted. Students have to identify a problem in their classrooms and then design tailor-made classes based on theories and approaches which they have learnt in the programme. The concepts and practices on evaluation and reflection of the classroom teaching performance are emphasized. Students are expected to apply advanced strategies of classroom management and environment setting to respond to their teaching reflections.",
