The approach of this course is broad, with marketing examined from the viewpoint of the enterprise rather than through business perspective. While this course necessarily includes reference to strategic management issues, major emphasis is placed upon the distinctive conceptual perspectives that are wholly within the domain of the firm’s marketing strategy. This course will build skills in such areas as: market opportunity analysis, the assessment of competitive advantages, forecasting patterns of market evolution, and developing marketing strategies consistent with these assessments. In addition, through case studies and other means, understanding is enhanced of the methods and concepts of marketing strategy analysis and how these can be applied in practice.",

      "description": "Customer analytics is a process by which businesses leverage customer data to make key marketing decisions. It has a precursor as the so-called process of customer relationship management (CRM). Historically, only repeated customer interactions—mainly in retail, service and industrial sectors—generate sizable data suitable for business analytics, and these data are stored in the CRM system. Today’s market sees proliferation of customer data for not just loyal customers but even first-time or short-lived visitors, on not only customer transaction histories but also their characteristics, attitudes, opinions, and behaviors. Thanks to the advancement of ready-to-use data analytics tools, businesses can easily tap into this rich information to understand their customers’ likes, needs, and wants better than ever before. If customers are the ultimate trophy that businesses are battling for in the market, customer analytics is the most powerful weapon a business need to master to outsmart one’s competitors.This course aims to provide students with the principles, frameworks as well as tools to make sense of customer data for business decision making. Our philosophy is to view customer data as assets of the business and the goal is to use right tools to uncover the relevant insights to acquire new customers, grow existing customers’ loyalty, and ultimately, improve all customers’ lifetime value to the business. In this course, we will ask the following questions: • How to allocate marketing resources to acquire new customers? • How to engage customers for their continued retention and relationship development? • How to utilize effective data analytics tools to generate actionable customer insights?We will then connect relevant findings to established strategies and tactics to develop and grow customer lifetime value.",

      "description": "One of the most important assets of any business is tangible: its brands. As industries become increasingly competitive, it is clear that strong brand-building skills are needed to survive and prosper. The Strategic Brand Management course is designed to provide conceptual background as well as practical approaches (i.e., relevant research techniques) to manage brands as a strategic asset as well as a primary source of competitive advantage. Topics include new product development process, brand creation, brand building, measuring/monitoring brand equity, and revitalizing brands. Although brands are one of the most important assets for any business, it is found that managers generally do not have very clear idea how to successfully manage their brands. Far too few managers really understand the concept of brand equity and how it must be implemented. In other words, managers need to learn the basic brand building concepts as well as the research techniques that can be used to collect data for brand planning. The objective of this course is to provide students with understanding regarding brand building concepts as well as to equip students with research techniques that can be used to build and manage a successful brand.",

      "description": "Making decisions, from the trivial to the fundamental, is part of the everyday life of every manager and investor. For the last 30 years, psychologists — and more recently also economists — have studied how people process information and make decisions. This research program has provided an insightful understanding of how people’s decisions deviate from “optimal” ones, and the consequences of such biases in financial and personal terms. This course is devoted to understanding the nature, causes and managerial implications of these limitations. It will help the students discover a series of serious yet often overlooked mistakes that most people would commit in a variety of decision contexts, including investment decisions, hiring decisions, purchase decisions and even marital decisions. At the same time, this course will also teach them how to correct these mistakes and how to reach optimal solutions. Instead of overwhelming the students with mathematic models or academic theories, this course will use many in-class exercises and questionnaires to convey the concepts.",
