This course will continue in this tradition by surveying the interactions between religion and society while developing the sociological and Anthropological approach to the study of religion as a social institution. In particular, we will look at the ways in which religion is transformed by, and plays a role in the transformation of, a global society. This course is designed to give students tools and concepts with which to understand the social organization of religion and the role of religion in society. We will focus on classical and emerging themes in the field, and analyze case studies that relate to them. Students will: -learn how religion is shaped by and, in turn, shapes the larger social field in which it exists;-become familiar with the dynamics of secularization, ecological theories, and other developments;-develop an understanding of the ways in which religion interacts with other social institutions such as the state and economy, and culture.",

      "description": "Recent researches on Chinese religion show that the term “three religions” or sanjiao monastic Buddhism, priestly Daoism, and Confucian philosophy - is not adequate to describe Chinese religiosity. To subsume several thousand years of Chinese religious experience under the term of “three religions”, in effect, is to exclude the vast majority of Chinese religious behaviour. In reality, only a few elite orient their lifestyles to the Buddhist or Taoist concepts of transcendence. Over emphasis on the intellectual and spiritual world of the scholarly official, the gentry and the literate elite, overlooks religious practices and beliefs of ordinary people, the peasants and the labourers who are the majority of the Chinese population. This course studies Chinese religion from the , traditional economy and village temples of various local societies in China.perspective of local society in South China. By making use of recent ethnographical studies on China, we examine Chinese religion from a holistic approach involving the analysis of lineage",

You will have had an opportunity to engage in some simple, practical self-realization practices, and hopefully will have obtained some insights into your own self-understanding.

      "description": "From more than 2500 years, Buddhism has spread almost all parts of the world, and undergone the developments from Primitive Buddhism, Theravada, Mahayana, to Tantriyana. In the contemporary world, Humanistic Buddhism has become one of the mainstreams of Buddhist developments. And the ideas and practices for the welfare of society and benefit of humanity have dominated Buddhist activities. This course designed to study the development of Humanistic Buddhism, including the history, thoughts, and practices. This course is divided into three parts yet each part is organically connected with the others. We first investigate the basic doctrines of traditional Buddhism related to the arising and practice of humanistic Buddhism, such as the Four Noble Truth, the Dependent-Origination, the ideas and practices of Bodhisattva. Having understood the doctrinal foundation of Humanistic Buddhism, we then examine the history of humanistic Buddhism in the early Republic era (1912-1949). Social, political, religious, as well as economic background in which Humanistic Buddhism arose will be discussed so that students could have holistic picture about the interaction between Buddhist institutions and society then. The teaching and practice of some pioneers of Humanistic Buddhism, such as Ven. Taixu will be examined to reveal the contents of Humanistic Buddhism. Towards the end of semester, we explore the contemporary developments of humanistic Buddhism in general, and Foguan Shan Buddhism in particular.",

This is a three-credit course in which the majority of the academic work is accomplished through group study and travel to some carefully selected religious sites, whether overseas or domestic. It aims to provide students with a lively and effective learning experience at an off-campus location for a minimum of three overnights, and enhances the student’s classroom learning through first-hand exposure to the religious relics and material culture. Each study tour will be organized and headed by experienced members of teaching staff.

These will include seminars and lectures delivered by the teacher in charge or staff members from other cooperating colleges, group discussions and presentations, on-the-spot investigation and any other forms of engagement, adding up to approximately 29 hours of off campus training.\n(3) Post-trip class presentation\nAfter the trip is finished, students are required to attend an extra on-campus class session to give presentation either in groups or individually to convey their reflections upon the study tour to fellow students.",

      "description": "Are religion and sex always at odds? Do gods have genders? How can political leaders be celebrated as supreme dads? What can we learn from Foucault’s History of Sexuality, Antonio Gramsci’s prison writings, and Weber, Mahmood, Sedgwick…?This course examines religion, gender and sexuality as crucial systems of power that shape our world. Students will develop an understanding of religion and gender as both subjects and as categories of analysis. As categories of analysis, students will use gender and religion to interrogate cultural production and social systems, paying close attention to how gender and religion intersect with other categories of social difference. Students will connect the assigned academic readings to “real-life” examples in the news, media, and their own lives, thereby producing new theoretical understandings of gender, religion, and sexuality in the contexts of Hong Kong, Asia, and the world.",
