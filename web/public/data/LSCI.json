Cryo-EM, a powerful technique involving rapid cooling of biological specimens in vitreous ice to preserve the structure for EM analysis, has become a dominant technique in the field of structural biology. Its board applications range from high-resolution structure determination of protein complexes using single particle analysis to visualization of subcellular structures in their native environment using tomography. On the other hand, X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool in studying small proteins and protein-drug interactions. Today, cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography are indispensable and irreplaceable tools in research to reveal unprecedented architectural details of macromolecular assemblies that are invaluable to our mechanistic understanding of the biological world as well as drug discovery. This course will cover the fundamental principles and concepts with an emphasis on practical aspects of these two fundamental techniques. Basic techniques, such as specimen preparation, machine operation, data acquisition, computational image analysis and structure solving, 3D map interpretation, and model building will be covered. With an emphasis on high-resolution structure determination, this course provides the necessary hands-on experience and entry-level trainings for students to perform cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography in their future research projects.",

Students will have the precious opportunities to obtain hands-on experience with some of the most advanced high speed/super-resolution microscopes in the field, such as spinning disc, Two-photon and STED laser confocal microscopes. Data processing/analysis using advanced image software, such as IMARIS, will also be covered.

Techniques covered will include TEM sample processing with high-pressure freezer, electron tomography, and live cell imaging with cutting-edge fluorescence microscopes. Emphasis will be placed on proper use of the state of the art microscopy instrument equipped in the RGC-AoE Center for Organelle Biogenesis and Function (COBF) and Centre for Cell & Developmental Biology (CCDB) of the School of Life Sciences (SLS).Students will learn the theories behind the techniques of transmission TEM, TEM sample preparation, tomography reconstruction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescent microscopy (confocal laser scanning microscopy--CLSM and spinning disk confocal microscopy--SDCM) imaging of live cells, as well as image analysis software (e.g. Imaris). The hands-on sessions will reinforce the application of these techniques to analyze mechanisms of cellular processes. It is expected that students will be able to incorporate these techniques readily into their research, as they will practice with the instruments that the COBF and CCDB possess for their actual applications in thesis research. This course is targeted to entering postgraduate students in SLS and student registration will be limited to 20. If seats are available, second-year postgraduates students can join. This course is scheduled in the fall term (1st semester) and consists of 5 lectures (3 hours each) and 8 hands-on sessions (3 hours each), totaling 39 hours.",

Two major focus areas include the development of chemical tools to proteins and cells, and in the identification and creation of novel compounds as therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. The course will begin with a brief review of organic chemistry fundamentals and bio-orthogonal ligand reactions. It will then cover case studies to illustrate the power of chemical biology to solve important problems at the chemistry-biology interface.",

Case studies on the use of molecular data in the study of evolutionary processes, biogeography and the history of life (including human evolution) will be included. This course is specially designed for advanced level of undergraduates, not only because of the course content, but it requires the students to think and integrate knowledge learnt from different courses in biology, molecular biology, cell biology, biotechnology, genetics, ecology, etc. In addition, a problem will be initiated by students and to be solved via searching for knowledge and information from diverse channels not only limited to scientific journal articles. Furthermore, a voluntary/optional field trip is organized for the students to define the problem of their own interests. These will help students to understand and analyse the problems from various aspects and multiple angles. Feedbacks will be provided throughout the course at different checkpoints.",

Students are required to watch online Lecture Videos in KEEP or Blackboard about Basic Knowledge in protein trafficking prior to the Lectures. These online Lecture Videos are supplemented with online quizzes in which students need to finish after watching these videos. In addition, students will also watch videos discussing recent Research Papers. During lectures, students will have in-depth discussion regarding the questions, key concepts and up-to-date research. By these means students will be able to clarify their concepts and be familiar with the latest research findings that are related to protein trafficking. Students will also learn the current developments of protein trafficking in details by delivering a presentation on a relevant topic derived from a recent research paper, with a Q&A session. The presentation will be graded by both Professor and peer students.",

Through detailed in-class discussion on the classic and the latest research literatures, students will learn how important theories and hypotheses of protein folding energetics were formulated, supported or disproved by experiments. The students will also learn how to apply the theories to improve protein stability in protein design and engineering through a group project.",

Techniques covered will include TEM sample processing with high-pressure freezer, electron tomography, and live cell imaging with cutting-edge fluorescence microscopes. Emphasis will be placed on proper use of the state of the art microscopy instrument equipped in the RGC-AoE Center for Organelle Biogenesis and Function (COBF) and Centre for Cell & Developmental Biology (CCDB) of the School of Life Sciences (SLS). Students will learn the theories behind the techniques of transmission TEM, TEM sample preparation, tomography reconstruction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescent microscopy (confocal laser scanning microscopy--CLSM and spinning disk confocal microscopy--SDCM) imaging of live cells, as well as image analysis software (e.g. Imaris). The hands-on sessions will reinforce the application of these techniques to analyze mechanisms of cellular processes. It is expected that students will be able to incorporate these techniques readily into their research, as they will practice with the instruments that the COBF and CCDB possess for their actual applications in thesis research. This course is targeted to entering postgraduate students in SLS and student registration will be limited to 20. If seats are available, second-year postgraduates students can join. This course is scheduled in the fall term (1st semester) and consists of 4 lectures (3 hours each) and 8 hands-on sessions (3 hours each), totaling 36 hours.",
