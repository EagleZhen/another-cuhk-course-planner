Cryo-EM, a powerful technique involving rapid cooling of biological specimens in vitreous ice to preserve the structure for EM analysis, has become a dominant technique in the field of structural biology. Its board applications range from high-resolution structure determination of protein complexes using single particle analysis to visualization of subcellular structures in their native environment using tomography. On the other hand, X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool in studying small proteins and protein-drug interactions. Today, cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography are indispensable and irreplaceable tools in research to reveal unprecedented architectural details of macromolecular assemblies that are invaluable to our mechanistic understanding of the biological world as well as drug discovery. This course will cover the fundamental principles and concepts with an emphasis on practical aspects of these two fundamental techniques. Basic techniques, such as specimen preparation, machine operation, data acquisition, computational image analysis and structure solving, 3D map interpretation, and model building will be covered. With an emphasis on high-resolution structure determination, this course provides the necessary hands-on experience and entry-level trainings for students to perform cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography in their future research projects.",

      "course_syllabus": "The students should take the initiative to form groups with three to four students at the beginning of the term. Students from different programmes are highly recommended. Students in one group should discuss with their supervisors and compromise a topic for the group research project. This project should not be just a purely academic research study but a project related to various impact of life sciences on the society of Hong Kong with or without some laboratory-based research components. The students in a group are required to investigate the proposed topic with teamwork and team building elements. The students should first survey the background of their research project and identify the scientific questions they want to address. The students then design and perform the laboratory-based experiments and/or non-laboratory-based research for this project under the guidance of the supervisors and submit a research proposal in the term end.\n\nPotential projects should include components as follows,\n\n1. Knowledge-oriented training\nStudents should attend laboratory training, workshop or tutorials, in which the core knowledge of relevant scientific knowledge of life sciences, including laboratory-based experimental design, scientific paper reading and writing, and basic calculation and statistics in life sciences, etc. are given.\n\n2.

Techniques covered will include TEM sample processing with high-pressure freezer, electron tomography, and live cell imaging with cutting-edge fluorescence microscopes. Emphasis will be placed on proper use of the state of the art microscopy instrument equipped in the RGC-AoE Center for Organelle Biogenesis and Function (COBF) and Centre for Cell & Developmental Biology (CCDB) of the School of Life Sciences (SLS).Students will learn the theories behind the techniques of transmission TEM, TEM sample preparation, tomography reconstruction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescent microscopy (confocal laser scanning microscopy--CLSM and spinning disk confocal microscopy--SDCM) imaging of live cells, as well as image analysis software (e.g. Imaris). The hands-on sessions will reinforce the application of these techniques to analyze mechanisms of cellular processes. It is expected that students will be able to incorporate these techniques readily into their research, as they will practice with the instruments that the COBF and CCDB possess for their actual applications in thesis research. This course is targeted to entering postgraduate students in SLS and student registration will be limited to 20. If seats are available, second-year postgraduates students can join. This course is scheduled in the fall term (1st semester) and consists of 5 lectures (3 hours each) and 8 hands-on sessions (3 hours each), totaling 39 hours.",

      "description": "This course introduces students to the pattern and processes of evolution. The course begins with an introduction of the history and philosophy of evolutionary ideas, followed by the genetics of adaptation, natural selection and speciation, and then on to the geological record and the fossil record of origination and extinction, and finishes with a discussion of the principle and practice of phylogenetic analyses and the molecular basis of evolution. Case studies on the use of molecular data in the study of evolutionary processes, biogeography and the history of life (including human evolution) will be included. This course is specially designed for advanced level of undergraduates, not only because of the course content, but it requires the students to think and integrate knowledge learnt from different courses in biology, molecular biology, cell biology, biotechnology, genetics, ecology, etc. In addition, a problem will be initiated by students and to be solved via searching for knowledge and information from diverse channels not only limited to scientific journal articles. Furthermore, a voluntary/optional field trip is organized for the students to define the problem of their own interests. These will help students to understand and analyse the problems from various aspects and multiple angles. Feedbacks will be provided throughout the course at different checkpoints.",

      "course_syllabus": "Stage 1: Learn how to address scientific problems by studying research literatures\nWe aim to teach students on how to formulate and support their hypothesis in protein folding research by good examples of research. We start with the classical protein folding experiments of Anfinsen who lead to the Nobel Prize in 1972, to the latest research on protein folding energetics. The students are challenged with open-end questions on how to address key questions on energetic factors that contribute to protein stability. Through intensive in-class discussions and quizzes, the students will learn how hypotheses on protein folding are supported or disproved by experimental evidence. Examples also include those published by scientists in Hong Kong so that the students have a more personal touch on how scientists innovate and design their researches.\nStage 2: Learn how to apply the theories learnt to improve protein stability in a group project.\nThe students are divided into small groups and work together on a group project to study how to improve protein stability using the theory of protein folding energetic learnt. They will survey the latest research literatures on the field and are asked to give critical assessment on how protein stability can be improved and present their views and findings in an oral presentation.",

Techniques covered will include TEM sample processing with high-pressure freezer, electron tomography, and live cell imaging with cutting-edge fluorescence microscopes. Emphasis will be placed on proper use of the state of the art microscopy instrument equipped in the RGC-AoE Center for Organelle Biogenesis and Function (COBF) and Centre for Cell & Developmental Biology (CCDB) of the School of Life Sciences (SLS). Students will learn the theories behind the techniques of transmission TEM, TEM sample preparation, tomography reconstruction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescent microscopy (confocal laser scanning microscopy--CLSM and spinning disk confocal microscopy--SDCM) imaging of live cells, as well as image analysis software (e.g. Imaris). The hands-on sessions will reinforce the application of these techniques to analyze mechanisms of cellular processes. It is expected that students will be able to incorporate these techniques readily into their research, as they will practice with the instruments that the COBF and CCDB possess for their actual applications in thesis research. This course is targeted to entering postgraduate students in SLS and student registration will be limited to 20. If seats are available, second-year postgraduates students can join. This course is scheduled in the fall term (1st semester) and consists of 4 lectures (3 hours each) and 8 hands-on sessions (3 hours each), totaling 36 hours.",
