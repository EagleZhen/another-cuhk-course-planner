The principal aim is to help students plan their curricula, including the academic and experiential components. It comprises three parts:1. Lectures that introduce the structure of the programme (outcome statement, study pattern of required and elective courses, concentration areas), experiential learning opportunities (mentorship and internship programmes), and exchange opportunities (choice of host institutions and transfer of credits). Senior students may also be asked to share their experiences in mentorship, internship, and exchange.2. Workshops on academic writing with emphasis on academic honesty. Topics include plagiarism, proper use of source materials, and citation styles. Each student will be asked to write and submit a summary of a collection of articles on a current topic in economics. Feedbacks will be given in a timely manner so that students can correct their errors and resubmit their work. A series of revisions and submissions will finally lead to academically acceptable articles – writings with clear logic, proper use of source materials, and proper citation style. 3. Sessions on presentation skills and interview skills. These include in-class debate sessions, group interview practices and cover-letter workshops.(Advisory: Course designed for students in their first year of major study in ECON. Capacity limited. Priority given to ECON major students.)",

To unravel the inner logic of the Chinese financial system, the course examines the various components of the financial sector, e.g., the banking sector, the foreign exchange market, the money market and the equity market. In addition, the challenges confronting China’s financial sector in the new millennium are explored. Among the special topics discussed are China’s accession to the WTO, the liberalization of interest rates, capital account liberalization, the choice of exchange rate arrangement for renminbi as well as measures to resolve the risks of the financial sector. Students are advised to take ECON2011 and 2021 before taking this course.",

The main goal of this course is to equip students with the basic economic intuitions and modeling techniques needed for further exploration in macroeconomic research. The course is divided into two parts. In Part 1 (Economic Growth), students will learn the modern analysis of economic growth. Basic growth theory, growth and development accounting will first be covered. Then new directions on the theories of growth and development will be studied, including an introduction of different models of endogenous growth and technological change. In Part 2 (Foundations of Modern Macroeconomics), important background and computational knowledge of macroeconomics beyond the Classical and Keynesian schools will be covered, including an introduction to Dynamic Programming, Real Business Cycle Theory and introductory macroeconometrics.",

      "description": "Using the Chinese economy as a context, the course is designed to guide and train students to think courageously, creatively, and critically. Students are required to find “puzzles” in the contemporary Chinese economy, to develop economic issues of general relevance from these “puzzles”, to frame these issues into theoretical or empirical questions, and finally to draft papers based on these questions. The course relies heavily on class discussion. Students are required to present at each stage of their thinking process. Students are advised to take ECON5010/5011/5012, 5020/5021/5022 and 5120/5121/5122 before taking this course.",

What goods do countries trade? How does openness to trade shape countries' industrial structure and global production sharing? The course also concerns the normative issues, such as: Is trade beneficial to everyone, or are there winners and losers? What is the impact of trade on economic growth, wage inequality and poverty? All these issues will be discussed both from theories and empirics, as well as at country, industry and firm level. In particular, we will also discuss the ongoing US-China trade war.",
