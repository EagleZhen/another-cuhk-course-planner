      "course_syllabus": "* *Week 1 Introduction: What are the relations of the Media and Politics?**\n\nThis lecture will outline the main themes and key issues which will be discussed in this course, the structure of tutorial session and assessment requirement.\n\n* *A. Changes of Mass Media**\n\n* *Week 2 The Hong Kong Media Landscape**\n\nA free and independent media is crucial to democracy. The Basic Law protects the Press Freedom of Hong Kong. But how free is it and to what extent? Who owns our Media?\n\nThis lecture will talk about the ownership and regulation of Hong Kong’s media and discuss what kinds of relations that are developed between media owners, the government and society.\n\n* *Week 3 Tabloidization of Mass Media**\n\nWhich newspaper you read everyday? (Or you don’t read newspaper!) What kind of news or which pages you read most frequently? Do you like ‘Li Bai Fong’ page of Appledaily?\n\nTabloidization reflects the change of news value in mass media. This lecture will talk about how and why hard news was replaced by soft news, in-depth news report was replaced by short article with eye-catching headline and soundbite.\n\n* *B. Changes in Contemporary Politics**\n\n* *Week 4 Americanization of Politics**\n\nAmericanization of political campaign happens in most democratic countries. Even in Hong Kong, live TV debate becomes a common practice during Elections. This lecture will talk about this transformation, the role of political advertising and political consultant in modern politics.\n\n* *Week 5 Mass Media and Social Movement**\n\nThe relationship of mass media and social movement turns sour. It was reflected in the Anti-Express Rail Link Movement. Media were widely criticized by the activists as ignoring or underplaying the level of public concern.\n\nThis lecture will talk about the role of mass media in social movement and revolution in global context and investigate how it has changed since Vietnam War.\n\n* *C. Interaction between Politics and Mass Media**\n\n* *Week 6 Politicians and journalists**\n\nWho is political journalist? Media and politician, who is more powerful?

Background briefing organized by government officials to announce or explain government polices behind the scene becomes more and more common.\n\nThis lecture will talk about how politicians manipulate the media. The communication strategy of UK New Labour government(1997-2010) will be studied as an example.\n\n* *Week 9 Legislative Council and Mass Media**\n\nLegislative Council meetings are often underplayed by local mass media. It is because the readers have no interest in the Legislators or the mass media themselves have no interested in them?\n\nThis lecture will talk about why Legislative Council meeting are often ignored by media. How parliament meetings are reported in the UK will be studied as an example as well.\n\n* *Week 10 Public opinion**\n\nDoes public opinion exist? Is SAR government really that unpopular? This lecture will talk about the role of public in political communication process.\n\n* *D. Cases Studies**\n\n* *Week 11 The media and politics in China**\n\nThis lecture will introduce the media system, the mechanism of news control and how reporters and media such as *the Caijing* or *the Southern metropolitan* media group resist the news censorship in China.\n\n* *Week 12 Al Jazeera phenomenon**\n\nThe Middle East News Channel, Al Jazeera TV generates a great impact in global politics. This lecture will briefly introduce how Al Jazeera transforms the global political landscape.\n\n* *Week 13 Conclusion**",

These theories were selected because of their direct relevance for developing an understanding of modern government behaviour.\n* Public administration is often considered in a managerial manner, as little more than control and straightforward analysis of efficiency and economy. This is not necessarily the case. People from different walks of life tend to have different expectations of government. This course is intended to foster a change in attitudes among students. After the course, students are expected to have the ability and tendency to think critically from multidisciplinary perspectives and to provide a critical appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of any theoretical approach.\n* Most important of all, by taking this course, students should have developed an understanding of the basic concepts and theories in public administration and should have gained the ability to apply them to the context of Hong Kong. Public administration, as an area of study, is very much a study based in American context. Therefore, it is important for students to reflect on the concepts and approaches covered in the course, and to consider how they can contribute to a better understanding of public administration in Hong Kong.\n* The course is intended to reinforce communication skills on the part of students. Through the training in debates and discussions, students should have developed the ability to convey abstract ideas and complicated issues in a concrete and organized manner.",

As politics is a reflection of culture, a systematic analysis of these movies will provide students with a “softer” way to understand the cultural context which shapes Chinese politics. After an introduction of the relationship between culture, movies, and politics, the course will examine how Chinese political culture could be read through Chinese movies produced under different political settings (Republican, Maoist, and post-Maoist China).",

      "description": "In the last twenty years, there has been considerable discussion about the future role of governments. The notion of ‘governance’ has taken shape out of the fact that governments are now facing a much more limited role in supplying public goods and organising societies. Their activities and decisions have been increasingly transferred to the private sector, NGOs, quangos and international organisations, even to the extent that public policy has been ‘hollowed out’. As such, this course depicts a general picture of contextual challenges confronting governments in public policy. The features and effects of globalisation, regionalization, marketisation, privatisation and the dynamism of civil society are discussed. In addition, the course discusses the ways in which governments have attempted to cope with these contextual uncertainties. Faced with the changing context, governments in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century are developing new mechanisms to influence populations. These new mechanisms contain: rationality, regulation, surveillance, risk and moral politics. While governments have undergone change, they may be more or less powerful than in the past.",

      "learning_outcomes": "The course will furnish students with the following capabilities and skills:\nBy the end of this course students should be able to demonstrate an awareness of the fact that the environment in which government has to make policy and organise society has substantially changed. In particular, the students are expected to develop an in-depth knowledge of selected concepts so that they can explain and interpret the difficulties confronting contemporary governments in making public policy.\nThroughout the course students are expected to uncover and discuss the new mechanisms of state power, including rationality, regulation, surveillance and risk management, and to the impact they have had. Consequently, the students should have the ability to analyse the fact that these new mechanisms have not just affected how governments operate but also what they do and their relations with the general public. The governments of twenty-first century are different from those in the past decades.\nThe course takes an international perspective in discussing the changes in government and the policy process. Case studies of developed countries such as Britain and America and developing states such as Argentina will be used to illustrate the concepts and theories highlighted in the course. Arguably, Hong Kong has also been under the crisis of declining ability to govern. Students are expected to have the ability to draw on the foreign cases and apply them to the analysis of public policy and public administration in Hong Kong.\nThe course is intended to reinforce communication and problem-solving skills on the part of students. They should be able to convey abstract ideas and complicated issues in a concrete and organised manner. Perhaps more importantly, the course emphasises the skills of independent research on the part of students, who are expected to identity governing problems and use foreign experiences to combat governing problems in the context of Hong Kong.",

      "description": "Political communication is a vital part of the daily work of politicians. They need to share their visions with the public. They need to help people understand complex public policy questions and solutions. They need to rally people to support certain courses of actions. And most important, they need to convince the voters in order to get elected and remain in power. To achieve these, effective communication is very important. This course aims at introducing students the basic theories and practices of political communication. It would explore the ways in which political messages are sent and received so that students can better understand how their lives are shaped, and then have a better reflection of real life politics. Moreover, while political communication becomes a rising profession, this course can provide a basic training to those students who want to begin their careers in this field.",

Globalization itself is introduced in a broad sense not limited by the economic aspect but a common experience of social change. For example, global environmental challenges, the common threat of nuclear crisis, the controversy between sovereignty and human rights, and the North-South divide. With both the historical and thematic perspectives, the class engages students with most recent research and debate on the topic. On the one hand, the class encourages students to relate their own experiences and observations in their own societies to digest what globalization is and what its impacts are. On the other hand, it also leads them to reflect on politics and social development in their own societies, in the context of globalization.",

      "description": "This course covers a wide variety of material and is highly relevant in understanding rapid changes in Global and Comparative European Politics. To catalyze your learning, this course will provide practical and contemporary examples throughout the course. Part I of the course provides a brief historical background to European politics and sets the scene for the course. The course starts out by examining how and why the European Union was formed alongside the traditional political landscape in Europe that is largely considered as stable in terms of voting and political behavior. Important theoretical concepts are introduced in Part I of the course, in examining theoretically how contemporary 'populism' is defined and conceptualized in the 21st century political landscape. Two divergent concepts, in the form of (a) right-wing populism and (b) left-wing populism are introduced, with key examples from contemporary European politics drawn on to further enhance students' learning.\nStudents are then introduced to the key theoretical debates on populism in the academic literature and are allowed to make critical evaluations about how they themselves will define populism as a political ideology.\nPart II of the course provides the main focus of the course, in focusing on the main causes and drivers that have led to the growth of (a) radical right-wing populism and (b) radical left-wing populism.\nThree key approaches are drawn on in Part II of the course, with comparative studies, survey research (public opinion) and case studies across Western Europe and Central-Eastern Europe allowing students to understand about the diversity and variations of populism in the contemporary political landscape. Students are then introduced to an important case study in the form of the landmark 2016 Brexit vote.\nFlipped classroom learning will be adopted here, with students watching and then having a critical debate based on a special documentary and discussing the role that radical right-wing populism and Euroscepticism has played in the Brexit vote and the future of the British political system. Students will also be tasked to work in groups and make group project presentations on a topic of their choice that relates to populism.\nPart III of the course introduces students to critical debates and evaluations on the 'rise' of populism and just how important understanding this political phenomenon is for (a) the implications for contemporary democracy and governance in EU member states, alongside (b) how populism on the 'right' and 'left' of the political spectrum is challenging the future EU project. Students are provided with a unique learning experience, with a practical and special Data Lab session that allows them to understand the root causes of populism, through a series of applied public opinion surveys (drawing on the Eurobarometer) and data analysis.\nThe final part of the course also allows students to understand the wider roots that right-wing and left-wing populism has had in shaking up the contemporary political landscape. Latest articles from academic research alongside newspaper and op-ed articles will be deployed to further enhance the overall student learning experience. In particular, the 'rise' of populist parties on the left and right will be linked to the electoral decline of mainstream social democratic parties in Europe.\nStudents will also be provided with a Special Guest Lecture, with a key speaker (European expert) from the Europe Asia Policy Centre for Comparative Research (EAP) coming in to share their own personal experiences, in outlining the role that populism has played in challenging the governance of the European Union and its key institutions. This session will also allow students to further their understanding of how the European Union works and most importantly allow students to ask questions from the guest speaker and further enhance their overall learning experience in an interactive setting. Students are also encouraged to draw on their own personal backgrounds and experience, in drawing on comparisons and making links between the causes of 'populism' in the European context, to the causes of 'localism' in the Hong Kong context.\nThe final part of the course also revisits the premise and assumption made in Part I of the course, about the historical stability of the European political landscape by outlining how 'a new form of politics' now exists in European politics. Stability and patterns of partisan alignment have now been replaced by instability and widespread patterns of electoral volatility. Thus, by the end of the course students will able to trace the historical evolution of European Politics and most importantly, the challenges that a number of contemporary European Union (EU) countries are facing in terms of their governance amidst the 'rise' of populist radical right and left-wing parties alike in the 21st century.",

Then it presents two typologies of collective political contentions, one based on claims, the other based on forms of collective action. The third part of the subject focuses on a number of key concepts that are often used to analyze the emergence of political contentions. Lastly the impact of political contentions is discussed.

Topics include: exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, reliability analysis and scale construction, data transformations, binary, ordinal and multinomial regressions, and structural equation modelling. The course focuses on practical applications rather than statistical theories. Published research articles are used to illustrate the rationales and problems of applying various statistical techniques and selected researches are repeated in class so that students can get first-hand experience in tackling these problems. Students with basic knowledge in quantitative methods preferred.",

It will take an interdisciplinary approach to unpack the complexity of sustainable development governance in a domestic-national-international linkage. The academic inquiry will center on the institutional analysis of effective governance for sustainable development in research and problem-solving terms. This requires students to investigate the evolving concepts of “governance” and “sustainable development” in perspectives with the view on identifying and establishing their theoretical connections through a critical review of an emerging body of related literature. This analytical endeavor will provide the academic basis for students to attempt conceptual advancement, methodological sophistication and policy innovation for contributing to the theory and practice of sustainability governance.",
