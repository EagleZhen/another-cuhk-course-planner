While recognizing the importance of the principalship the course assumes that leadership resides and operates across various levels within and outside traditional school boundaries and that teacher leadership is an important area of study. Areas covered include strategic and ethical leadership, panel leadership, leadership for learning and comparative, cross-cultural understandings of leadership. The course attempts to locate school leadership at the local level within a broader national, regional and international perspective. Through a combination of case studies, journal writing, problem-based cases, experiential activities and self-guided learning students apply leadership knowledge to their own personal and school contexts.",

It aims to sharpen students’ focus on the conceptual and methodological backgrounds of complex issues in a contested field where crucial educational matters are decided and put into action. A general treatment of the social, economic, and institutional perspectives will lay the foundation of inquiry into the approaches to policy formulation, policy implementation, and administrative conduct. A conscious effort to relate major policy and administration issues to relevant developmental experiences and research findings will facilitate political, social, and economic interpretations of policy and administrative measures that have far-reaching influence on the educational development of Hong Kong. Issues in educational structure, alternative models of schooling, organizational change in schools, parental voice and choice, curricular change, examination and assessment, and teacher development will constitute the major concerns of this course.",

At the end of the first and second semesters respectively, every group should submit an interim report and a final report of the design project. In addition to the self-arranged meetings with their supervisors, all groups are required to attend four compulsory seminar-based lectures for the following purposes: 1. Introducing the learning design projects (at the beginning of the 1st semester)2. Presenting the project proposals (at the beginning of the 2nd month of the 1st semester)3. Presenting the interim project reports (at the beginning of the 2nd semester)4. Presenting the final project reports (at the end of the 2nd semester)",

These areas of special needs include: 1) learning disabilities; 2) giftedness and talents; 3) autism spectrum disorder; 4) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; and 5) emotional and behavioral disorders. For each kind of special need, students will learn its characteristics, causes, and provision of special education in Hong Kong. Besides, this course will also prepare students for developing essential intervention strategies and techniques to help children with learning difficulties. Students will also work in small groups, under the supervision of the instructor, to conduct case studies in order to strengthen their knowledge of the learning difficulties of selected groups of children and adolescents.",

What most parents really need is not simply the skills of parenting, but a commitment to parenthood. This course will cover the existential and developmental dimensions of parenthood, scrupulously interpreting the latent crisis and life momentum behind daily parenting practices. Equal attention will be given to the meanings and concerns, needs and opportunities, challenges and obstacles, and developmental effects of parenthood on the parents themselves from early parenthood to grandparenthood. The significance of offspring and future generation for the healthy development of a person as a self-actualizing and generative individual, as emphasized in humanistic psychology will be thoroughly discussed and analyzed.",

The course will examine the relationship between family, school, and community for children‘s education, parents empowerment and school improvement. For the past two decades, growing evidence shows that parents are valuable but largely untapped resources for the field of education. In Hong Kong, FSC collaboration is of particular interest to policy makers and educators because it may have considerable potential to address three major problems in public education: scarcity of resources; rigidity of bureaucracy; and quality and inequality of educational outcomes. The course will help participants understand how to obtain higher and better participation from all families regardless of their background; and to enhance the inclusive attitude of educators (including teachers, social workers, etc.) to address the diverse needs of parents and their children.",

These changes, together with the emergence of the concepts of ‘childhood’ and ‘motherhood’, have tremendous impacts on the ideal of parenthood and parenting practices. Such ideal and practices are subsequently challenged in a post-industrial/ post-modern era. This course seeks to provide sociological perspectives to understanding parenting in a variety of social, cultural, and historical contexts, which will enable students to make sense of parenting practices in Hong Kong. The implications of such parenting practices for social inequality and social development will also be discussed.",

Analysing the different areas of human experience and knowledge should lead to a reconceptualization of the task of organizing curriculum from a higher standpoint. In this course, the design and implementation problems of different ways of curriculum organization, such as discipline-based curriculum, integrated curriculum and modular curriculum in different stages of education will be studied. This exercise of reflection should better prepare course participants for the practical task of curriculum design.",

School reform policies are often viewed as endeavors to enhance national competitiveness in the world arena. New administrative measures can also be perceived as means to attain efficiency and effectiveness. These will be examined. By referring to the experiences of countries, mostly developed ones, which have influenced the direction of local school reform, and drawing insights from relevant research findings, this course will address critical issues in key areas of school reform in this part of the world. Topics to be discussed in this course will include: change in conception of human capital and reform in educational administration, school governance, resource allocation, curricula and teaching, quality assurance, teacher and principal preparations, leadership practices and so on.",

By way of class discussion and out-of-class activities, we shall bring out for debates major theoretical, practical, and ethical issues involved in the following decisions throughout the research process: how to design a qualitative study so as to address research questions raised at the outset, what are relevant data that could answer the research questions, how to choose appropriate research methods to collect such relevant data, how to analyse and interpret qualitative data (of various types), and how to present the collected data. Fundamental issues in conducting a qualitative study, ranging from the role of a theoretical or conceptual framework, through the access to subjective, intersubjective, and objective knowledge, to the establishment of its validity and reliability, will also be deliberated.",

      "description": "This course is designed for doctoral students who want to conduct a qualitative research project. The course will offer the multifaceted and advanced knowledge needed for such work, plus core techniques commonly used in the qualitative research paradigm. Providing students with a comprehensive and sophisticated understanding of philosophical stances underpinning different qualitative methodologies will help them situate their research and shape the deployment of their qualitative inquiry in an informed manner. The course will concentrate on developing students' knowledge and practical skills for conducting qualitative research in the following areas: (1) the use of relevant explanatory and exploratory research questions in different qualitative studies; (2) writing a critical literature review and theoretical sensitivity; (3) formulating a research protocol and the practice of triangulation; (4) hands-on experiences of collecting qualitative data with relevant data collection techniques; (5) data interpretation and analysis through coding practices based on the content analysis approach; (6) having theory building with the application of grounded theory; (7) developing skills to draw conclusions and write reports, both of which serve as the basis for preparing a doctoral research proposal and/or thesis; (8) special attention will be given to the issue of ‘researcher as instrument’ and related ethical issues. To put the knowledge acquired into practice, students will be required to undertake a mini qualitative project individually with rigorous research design. It is anticipated that students will gain the competency to interpret and report their research findings in an academic manner.",

In recent years, even though the call for more evidence-based educational practices has become ubiquitous, new instructional innovations and practices have been implemented faster than the accumulation of research evidence. In this course, we will first discuss the meaning of scientific approach in educational research that have shaped the current landscape of the field. Then, we will discuss how this approach enhances the understanding of recent instructional innovations and practices for the improvement of students’ learning. Students of this course are expected to learn about both “form” (i.e., methodology) and “substance” (i.e., content) of educational research by critical analysis of the literature in order to become prepared for leading roles in instructional innovations and practices.",

As children develop, they constantly make sense of the social world around them. Their social cognition, in turn, guides their interactions with others. Indeed, a major goal of socialization is for children to develop the ability to understand and act effectively on the social environment, so that they can function as accepted and competent members of their societies. In this course, we will examine children’s psychosocial development. Potential topics include the nature of human development, achievement motivation, family process and parenting, and changes in youth emotional functioning and interpersonal relationships.",

This course is designed to familiarize students with the principles, structure and process of education research, and it is organized into two parts. The first part is in the form of lecture which takes up the first seven sessions of the courses. It aims to provide students with a general understanding of the nature and substance of education research. Thus, topics to be covered in these lectures are major paradigms in education inquiry, the philosophical and ethical issues relating to education research, and the basic principles and procedures in education research. The second part of the course is organized in the form of seminar during the two semesters. Each seminar is conducted by a research student in the Division of Education and is supervised by no less than two members of the teaching staff of the Faculty of Education. Depending on the research interests of the research students conducting the seminars, research ideas and plans in educational studies will be critically reviewed and discussed.
