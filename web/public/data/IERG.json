Students are invited to provide written feedback on \"the best aspects of the course so far\", \"aspects most in need of improvement\", \"How might the instructor improve his/her teaching\", a few other questions. These feedback are valuable to the course instructors and teaching assistants, who may accordingly make adjustment on the teaching methods as well as course content.\n\n2. End-of-term course evaluation\nThe end-of-term course evaluation is a formal and comprehensive evaluation process through students provide not only numerical ratings but also constructive suggestions on the course and teachers. The survey covers the aspects of students' overall satisfaction, course organization and objectives, pace of teaching, workload, etc.Statistical analysis of numerical ratings and written feedback are sent to the course instructor shortly after the end of term.\n\n3. Face-to-face interaction\nStudents' feedback are collected through face-to-face interaction, which may take place in tutorial classes, laboratory sessions, individual consultation (with course instructor and/or teaching assistants).\n\n4. Online platform\nStudents' feedback are collected via various types of online platforms, which include (and not limited to) email, Blackboard, Piazza.\n\n5. Student experience questionnaire\nSurvey on student experience is carried out by the Centre for Learning Enhancement and Research. Students may provide feedback on specific courses in the survey.",

In the first phase, a computer game is built. The students are then asked, in the second phase, to modify the code in the first phase so as to build a different game. If the design of the game in phase 1 is not sufficiently abstract, then it is very difficult to modify the code so as to change the game to a different one quickly.

Setup and manage a two-layer firewall network architecture and appreciate its effectiveness;\n3. Design and implement secure tunnel between main office and data center;\n4. Design and implement an enterprise level wireless LAN with both security and user friendly features;\n5. Design and implement a basic private cloud infrastructure at private site and data center.\n6. Design and implement a basic IPv6 network infrastructure at local site.\n7. Design and implement an IPv6 connection to remote client mobile devices.\n8. Setup a VPN connection for remote management device ;\n9. Perform basic network monitoring and debugging; Unlike traditional lab course, no detail design plan or implementation steps are provided for the students. Students need to figure out the solution by themselves according to the problem specification. We treat students as engineers and want to train up their skills in network design, peer collaboration, problem solving, and protocol debugging under a setting which is similar to the real-world environment.",

Setup and manage large-scale Enterprise Networks with modern virtualization technology: Students will learn how to design their private cloud and HA infrastructure by using hypervisor setup at local and remote site. They need to setup secure tunnel for their enterprise network and remote data center network. L2TP will be used to support secure tunnel and VPNs.\n2. Two layer firewall architectures: Setup and manage the two-layer firewall with heterogeneous platform equipment with the switches, routers, and servers.\n3. Enterprise WLAN: Students learn how to build an enterprise Wireless LAN with different level of security and authentication settings, such as multiple SSID, captive web gateway, WEP, WPA, 802.1x, EAP/TLS and RADIUS\n4. IPv6 : Students learn how to configure their routers and servers to support IPv6 environment and deploy the connectivity to the remote mobile clients over VPN tunnels.\n5. Network monitoring and debugging: Students learn how to debug and test the performance of their networks\n\nThe course syllabus may be updated from year to year.",

Advanced topics for designing control and optimization algorithms for large and decentralized settings will also be discussed, including primal- and dual-based decomposition, distributed/asynchronous algorithms, proximal optimizations, and stochastic approximation. The second part of the course will then introduce the Markov decision process and dynamic programming for tackling sequential decisions with significant uncertainty.
