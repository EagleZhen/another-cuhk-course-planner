      "description": "This course consists of four major components:1. Our Roles for a Sustainable Future How can we lead a good life in a just society? How can individual actions affect events at a global scale? These are the questions every student should ask and take seriously. We will explore them through the United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in this section of the course.2. Sustainable Development for Our FutureThis section of the course seeks to help students to think about what their future is going to be like if humanity continues business-as-usual. Selected issues that critically impact the future of our planet will be discussed. In-depth discussion on the issues, including responses from various sectors of the society around the world, will be guided by the SDG Framework.3. Sustainable Development of Cities and Communities to Ensure Good Health and Well-beingThis section of the course enhances students’ knowledge on impact of urban development on health and well-being by making use of concept of Healthy City to illustrate socio-economic and political determinants of health. It aims to broaden the students’ concept of health and well-being to address issues of sustainable urban development. This section focuses on 2 key SDG’s, Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3) and Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11). Other determinants for health and well-being, such as reduction of poverty (SDG 1) and reduction of inequality (SDG 10), and health justice (SDG 16), will also be discussed. 4. Creativity and Design Thinking for a Sustainable FutureThis section of the course examines the topic of creativity and design thinking. The key question to be discussed is how we can put design creativity to good use in our everyday life as well as in projects that we choose to pursue to create a world of peace and prosperity.",

The idea should be feasible, sustainable, and promising in terms of improving social well-being. Each group should consist of students from diverse backgrounds. Students may form their own groups. Students will work under the supervision of an instructor, who guides the students from the creation of an idea to the writing and presentation of a proposal and/or action plan. Performance throughout the work process is graded. Advisory: For Final Year College students only.",
