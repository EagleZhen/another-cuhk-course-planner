The concepts and recent advance in animal phylogeny will be introduced and the enormous diversity of animals will be introduced through an evolutionary journey. We will discuss the major structural, anatomical and physiological characteristics in respect to the origin and adaptive radiation of animals. Second half of the course focus into the intricate relationship between zoological diversity and effective pest management strategies. Students will study the principles of zoological diversity conservation and its significance in sustainable pest control practices. Through a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical applications, students will gain insights into the cost and benefit of integrated pest management approaches, aiming to minimize environmental impact while effectively managing pest populations. By the end of this course, students will be equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to address pest challenges while promoting biodiversity conservation.",
