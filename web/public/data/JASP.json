This course examines the development and academic significance of various forms of Japanese popular culture such as films, comics, music, TV dramas and culinary culture, from multidisciplinary perspectives, including history, cultural anthropology, cultural studies and media studies. It aims to deepen understanding the following three facets of Japanese popular culture:1) the applicaton of cultural globalization theory in Japan; 2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries; and 3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society. Using concrete examples and grounding on representative academic writings, this course discusses the globalization of Japanese popular culture and relevant issues in indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows and media-mix. Students are trained to understand the nature and cultural implications of Japanese popular culture in an Asian context. Besides lectures, discussions and readings, this course selectively utilizes topical essays (projects), e-learning, audio-visual materials and fieldwork-based assignments as supplementary teaching tools.",

Using Japan as a principal example, this course aims at examining the possibilities and challenges of achieving sustainable development goals through tourism. The first part of this course introduces basic concepts of tourism and sustainable development goals, and discusses their relationship. The second part of the course compares Japan to China and other countries, and investigates the benefits and costs of tourism in relation to sustainable cities and communities, indigenous culture, and natural resources. Additional discussions further explore the potentials of sustainable tourism in Hong Kong. With assigned readings and coursework, students are expected to acquire knowledge on sustainable development goals, and critically evaluate tourism as a means to achieve these goals.",

The topics in this course will cover pronunciation of ‘Kana’, simple daily life communication topics to express their favorite food, interest/hobby, shopping, places they want to go/things they want to do in Japan, etc. In order to have a better understanding of Japanese society, relevant Japanese cultural topics will also be included in this course. After completing this course, students will have basic knowledge of Japanese ‘Kana’ and be able to communicate in simple Japanese language with Japanese people on topics introduced in this course. For students who opt for further study in Japanese language, this course will provide a good foundation for them to have a smooth transition to the upcoming elementary course. On the other hand, for students who do not opt for further study, this course will also provide simple basic language knowledge for daily conversation with Japanese people while visiting Japan in the future.Students who have attended any one year exchange study programme in Japan and/or passed any level of Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) are NOT allowed to take this course.",

As students have covered the historical and sociopolitical groundings of modern and contemporary Japan, this course goes deeper into the social science of Japan by examining the major social institutions of home, school, and work to facilitate our understandings of the primary forces of socialization and organization and the dynamics of power in contemporary Japanese social life. Furthermore, it addresses the new challenges emerging within each of these spheres based on Japan’s changing socio-economic and demographic landscapes. The study of Japan challenges us to reevaluate the premises of Western social theory as well as HK-centric conceptualization, and it rewards us with fresh understandings of the transformations to modernity and the nature and direction of modern life.

      "description": "This course introduces the social scientific study of gender, sexuality, and family in Japan from the postwar to the contemporary period from a comparative perspective. As the course covers a lot of readings, writings, and discussions on the issues of gender and sexuality, students are expected to come to class prepared to discuss the readings and facilitate the class discussion. For many, Japan represents a sweeping stereotype of extreme gender norms vis-à-vis contemporary Euro-American gender norms and manifestations. Such stereotypes are employed not only by outsiders to critique the society ethnocentrically, but also by some natives as well. Both sides frequently comment on the ways gender and gendered expectations shape and even determine contemporary experiences of “being Japanese.” Furthermore, stereotypes about gender and sexuality in Japan frequently overlap with and draw from broader stereotypes about Japan vis-à-vis other Asian societies and Asian societies vis-à-vis Western societies.By identifying these stereotypes and also critically questioning what gender means and how it is being shaped in and shaping contemporary Japan, this course will offer an entry into theories of gender studies and sexuality, and also introduce tools to critically analyze cultural differences manifested in the issues of gender and sexuality while at the same time learning more about Japanese society and your own society. Moving between historical and contemporary definitions of gender, sexuality, and family to look at change and continuity of gendered life ways in Japan, the course is divided into five sections addressing issues of: 1) Defining Gender and Gender Stereotypes; 2) Gender and Social Institutions; 3) Gender Construction / Performance; 4) The Politics of Sexuality and Identity; and 5) Gender and “Marginality.” In each section we investigate cultural constructions of gender, sexuality, and family and key themes that revolve around them: identity, class, morality and life course in contemporary Japan. At the end of each section we will take time to reflect on gender and sexuality in Asia more broadly. Class sessions will consist of lecture sessions devoted to explaining the readings in context and tutorial sections for facilitating active discussions and student presentations. Assignments for the course will ask students for active participation and weekly discussion questions, a reflective mid-term essay, and a final exam.",

Narrowly escaping colonization, Japan transformed into one of the most important imperial and economic powers in the world. Modern Japan is also doubly fascinating for a comparative take on the great themes of modern global history: the social upheavals and transformations of capitalism and democracy, the rise and fall of modern imperialism, the experience of total war, and the spread of a mass consumer culture. This course examines the invention of new traditions and the construction of a new national identity, the rise and fall of empire, the devastation of World War II, and the astonishing postwar economic growth and puzzling stagnation in contemporary times. This course explores how people in Japan have dealt with the dilemmas of modernity that challenge us all.",

Fought on multiple fronts on three continents, the war witnessed a complex mesh of ideologies and war aims. It wrought unparalleled destruction and targeted civilians to an unprecedented degree. It has been the only war to date in which atomic weapons were used. The war pitted empires against each other and led to the fall of many of those global empires. This course will focus on World War II in Asia. It uses Japanese history as a window into global processes, and also places the war in its proper regional context. Beginning with World War I, this course journeys through the crisis of East Asian international relations in 1920s and 1930s to the outbreak of a multi-front war in East and Southeast Asia. It considers the war’s impact on empires and nations, soldiers and victims, and peoples throughout the region. And it explores the legacies that remain visible across the region today.",

Japan’s remote geographic location made it possible for changes to come relatively slowly, and except for the postwar reform, most innovations resulted from the voluntary adoption of foreign cultures rather than external pressure. This course discusses how Japanese civilization, i.e. the Yamato nation, and the Japanese language were formed. How Japanese society arose through the localization of foreign cultures will be one of the major themes covered. Efforts will be made to identify nation-wide characteristics, if any, and investigate how they were cultivated over the centuries. Special attention will be paid to the similarities that can be found between the two major social reforms in modern Japanese history, i.e. the Meiji Restoration and postwar reform, and to the question of how these reforms influence Japan society today.",

It further allows students to explore the influence of Japanese youth cultures in other Asian societies. The course encourages students to compare youth cultures in Japan with that of China, Hong Kong, and North America. The course will also consider the rise of transnational youth cultures based on movements of people, ideas, and images across national borders. It will explore the emergence of a Japan influenced youth popular culture in Asia as well as the particular local contexts in which the experiences of youth take on meanings for individuals.",

Thus this is not a survey course of different kinds of popular culture in Japan, but rather this course requires us to theoretically engage in social theories of popular/mass culture and analyze interpretations of meanings and forms of particular “popularly massified” socio-cultural phenomena in Japan.The course first provides literature on the major classical and critical theories of the “culture industry” in Europe as well as the formation of mass society in Japan. Next, we will analyze the forms and meanings of the diverse, popularly massified culture of production and consumption by examining anthropological works on Japan. Specifically, this course examines the issues of popular culture and mass culture through four different spheres: culture industries, media consumption, material culture and fandom, and globalization. Through analyzing these four spheres, the course also traces the thematic issues of gender, class, and cultural politics in the context of modernization and globalization. These issues provide the underlying structure and symbols that demonstrate how anthropologists approach a particular representation of complex popularized cultural movements under late capitalism.",

      "description": "This course aims to explore the possible motivations and political backgrounds underlying the production of films that are related to WWII in East Asia, following the end of the Cold War, that is, during and after the 1990s. The intention is to analyze whether the demise of the Cold War has provided a more favorable time for Japan, China and the US to re-examine WWII in a fresh light. The year 1990 marks a watershed for geopolitics. In that immediately prior to and after 1990, the world witnessed many historical events still thought of as the most significant in recent history, even today. Such events as regards East Asia include the Tiananmen Incident, the burst of Japan’s bubble economy, the disintegration of the USSR and the rise of China. Security concerns among China, Japan and the US changed following 1990 in that Russia is no longer thought of as being a common threat of such primary importance as was the case with its predecessor state, the USSR. There is today a renewed sense of nationalistic assertiveness that can be seen in disputes in and amongst Japan, China and the US over history, territories, military expansion and in conflict over trade between these economic giants. At the same time, in the last twenty years, there have been frequent productions of movies related to WWII in East Asia, on events where differing views of history cause controversy, such as the Nanjing Massacre, Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima. There is therefore importance in investigating to what extent these movies are a reflection of such nationalistic sentiment, as well as the extent to which the WWII theme in filmmaking for a popular market is a tool for groups harboring specific political and ideological agendas. This course emphasizes interdisciplinary research and study methods, including film criticism, history and cultural studies. Students are required to choose a related topic at the beginning of the course and present his/her ideas in the last two lessons. Based on the presentation, students are required to submit a paper of about 3,000 words in the end of the semester, indicating their appreciation and understanding of the lecture materials and required readings.",

In addition to these so-called “three teachings,” we also discuss popular religion in South-east Asia, new combinatory religions such as Aum Shinrikyo and Cao Đài, and the impact of East Asian religious ideas on the West. We will also address religion in modern times, understanding how traditions continue to carve out roles for themselves in a secular world.",

This course introduces the structure of dialect by comparing the differences between the “standard language” and one representative example of Japanese dialects: the Kansai dialect. Students will learn how Kansai dialect reflects the culture and customs of the Kansai area through the perspectives of sociolinguistics. This course will use multi-media resources such as novels, T.V. soap dramas as teaching materials to illustrate the daily usage of the Kansai dialect.",

Preparation for the project begins in year one and year two when students take JAS1010, JAS1050, and JAS1090. In these courses, students gain familiarity with contemporary Japanese politics, economy, culture and society. Students also learn to identify and evaluate academic arguments, locate academic sources, cite sources properly, and identify and assess basic social science and humanities research methods. In the third-year of study, students decide on their research topic and methods, and appropriately apply research methods to collect data for the project. Students who are in the fourth year of study, should have completed data collection and should be writing the paper. Students should have made efforts to speak, read, and write Japanese to achieve their research aims. Students are expected to have used Japanese for activities such as requesting assistance, conducting interviews, creating questionnaires, surveying media sources, and conducting literature reviews. The final-year project completed during the required courses JAS4601 and JAS4602 is thus the final product of the previous three years’ of preparation in both Japanese studies and Japanese language.",

      "description": "Regardless of the overwhelming influence from ancient China, Japan has developed into one of the world’s most distinctive cultures. Japan’s peripheral geographic location made it possible for gradual changes to occur based on its own internal needs. Except for the postwar reform, most Japanese innovations resulted from the voluntary adoption of foreign cultures rather than external pressure from foreign countries.This course explores how the Yamato nation and the Japanese language were formed based on hypotheses in related fields. How Japanese society arose through the localization of foreign cultures will be dealt with from a cultural historical point of view. Attempts will be made to identify nation-wide characteristics, if any, and investigate how they were cultivated over the past centuries. Special attention will be paid to the similarities that can be found between the two major social reforms in modern Japanese history i.e. the Meiji Restoration and postwar reform. The course also discusses how these reforms influence modern Japan society.",

      "description": "Japanese economic growth has been one of the most remarkable success stories of the past century. Japanese business practices have emerged from Japan’s particular path to modernization and its capitalist conditions. What are the characteristics of Japanese capitalism? In what ways do capitalist economies differ from one another in their social organization, institutional embeddedness, gendered relations, and modes of governance? What are the challenges of such differences for management and economic performance in a competitive global economy? How have Japanese corporations responded to the processes of globalization and neoliberalization? In tackling these questions, we will analyze the issues of industrialization, globalization and neoliberalism as well as a broad range of topics, including those related to labor, industrial organization, the theory of the firm, management, gender, and economic reforms in Japanese society. Finally by examining the inside of the Japanese corporate world, we also learn some of the “techniques” that Japan had/has invented and introduced to the world. Thus this course challenges the common and presentist views of “Japanese business” and “Japanese corporations.” Instead it introduces the complex development of Japanese capitalism from the early 19th century to the present and examines ongoing transformations within Japanese capitalism.",

Thus this is not a survey course of different kinds of popular culture in Japan, but rather this course requires us to theoretically engage in social theories of popular/mass culture and analyze interpretations of meanings and forms of particular \"popularly massified\" socio-cultural phenomena in Japan.The course first provides literature on the major classical and critical theories of the \"culture industry\" in Europe as well as the formation of mass society in Japan. Next, we will analyze the forms and meanings of the diverse, popularly massified culture of production and consumption by examining anthropological works on Japan. Specifically, this course examines the issues of popular culture and mass culture through four different spheres: culture industries, media consumption, material culture and fandom, and globalization. Through analyzing these four spheres, the course also traces the thematic issues of gender, class, and cultural politics in the context of modernization and globalization.These issues provide the underlying structure and symbols that demonstrate how anthropologists approach a particular representation of complex popularized cultural movements under late capitalism.",

Special attention is given both to the role of mass media in reflecting and projecting society and the characteristics of media practices as a central force in the shaping of culture. Through study of major institutions in Japan’s media industry, students will explore and critique the powerful collaboration of media, technology, and business, and develop an informed, ethical view of the impact that these institutions continue to have on community, national, and global life.",

      "terms": [],
      "description": "“Asia” is one of the core concepts of Japanese cosmopolitanism. In the modern era (19th-20th century), when the world dynamics were changing drastically, Japanese intellectuals tried to break away from the old East Asian order centered on China and put forward a new worldview to build up a modern Japanese national consciousness and regional order. The discussion of “Asia” is one of the specific attempts. This is an exploratory course that analyzes various Asian discourses from the perspectives of the history of Sino-Japanese relations, the history of East Asia, and the history of the world and discusses the process of change in Japan's understanding of Asia and the world from different perspectives, including history, ideology, politics, economics, literature, and culture.The lectures cover the Asian (East Asian) understanding of China and Japan in ancient times, the Asian view and worldview of Japan in modern times, the interaction between the late Shogunate thinkers and the times, the activities and evolution of different Asianist organizations in the Meiji period, such as the Shinyasha (振亞社), the Koya-kai (興亞會), the Asia Society (亞細亞協會), the Toho-Kyokai (東邦協會), the Genyōsha (玄洋社), and the Kokuryū-kai (黑龍會), as well as the Asian views and interactions between the important thinkers of China and Japan such as Sun Yat-sen, Li Dazhao, Fukuzawa Yukichi, Okakura Tenshin, and others. It also explores the views of post-war Japan, China, Korea, the United States, India, and other countries on the Asian/East Asian conflicts and alliances, discussing the possibilities and challenges of the integration of post-war Asia or East Asia.",
