      "description": "Hong Kong embodies the Common Law’s tradition, methods, rules, principles, and values. In this course, students will receive a solid grounding in the foundations and principal features of the Common Law as a legal system. Throughout the course, students will consider: (i) the extent to which the Common Law reflects and shapes the customs, traditions, and values of the societies it serves, with particular reference to Hong Kong society; (ii) the adaptability of the Common Law to serve different types of societies; and (iii) the role of the Common Law in underpinning civil and economic stability and liberty. Students will also develop their conceptual, research, and writing skills. Topics include: the historical origins of the Common Law in England; the reception of the Common Law; core values of the Common Law; stability and change – stare decisis, judicial reasoning, inductive versus deductive reasoning; ratio decidendi and obiter dicta; appeals; judicial independence; parliamentary supremacy; statutory interpretation; the independence of the legal profession; the legal academy; and evidence, juries and ‘the reasonable man.’ In relation to developing the students' appreciation of Common Law method, students will be given the opportunity to develop their own independent research, analysis, problem-solving, and writing skills for the study of law, using traditional paper and modern electronic resources. In particular, students will learn how to use the Law Library, drawing on primary and secondary legal materials, and how to read and interpret the sources of the Common Law.",

They will be able to define the sources of law, to find the sources of law by using hard copy and soft copy research tools, to cite accurately the sources of law, to read and understand the reasoning employed in the sources of law.\n\nStudents will be able to identify, critically analyse and employ the rules and presumptions relating to both the doctrine of stare decisis and to the practice of statutory interpretation\n\nStudents will have assimilated a variety of sources of information and will have begun to develop an ability to prioritise and employ academic authorities in constructing their own arguments and responses to contemporary debates relating to the common law. Students will also have begun to familiarize themselves with, and to critique, the reasoning processes employed by the actors and institutions of the common law.",

      "description": "Legal analysis, research, and writing skills are essential for successful completion of your law degree and will equip you with many transferable skills for future study and professional life. You must learn how to analyse legal problems, research the relevant law and apply the law to the problems. This course is intended to provide an introduction to these skills which will be honed by your further legal studies and application of the skills.This course is very much “hands on”, as it will aid your learning by preparing answers to legal research problems. The problems may be from a variety of legal areas. By analysing these problems you will identify the legal issues that need to be researched. You will then be introduced to legal research resources, both paper and electronic, and guided through the research needed to provide a framework for your answers to the problems. The presentation of your answers is of the utmost importance. Lawyers must be effective communicators and have a command of language both written and oral. This course will introduce you to clear and effective presentation of your answers in writing and orally. For both writing and oral presentation you will learn how to structure, explain and support your legal analysis.Law differs from many other disciplines as you may be writing or presenting for many different audiences. Thus you may have to prepare answers to legal problems which are to be presented to your professors, a client, colleagues in a law firm, or in court. The skills required to prepare a summary of the relevant law for a busy partner in a firm are very different from those required for your legal essays as an undergraduate. You will also be taught how to make your presentation persuasive if appropriate. You will be encouraged to consider for whom you are researching and ensure that your writing and presentation is appropriate for your audience. You may be required to prepare the answers to these problems in written form, as short essays or legal memoranda, or orally, by way of short presentations before your peers or in a moot.The course will be taught by way of lectures and tutorials. In the lectures your professors will introduce legal problems to you and explain how they are analysed, how they are researched and how this research is then applied to the problem to prepare answers. In the tutorials you will provide the analysis, research and answers.",

It is one of the reasons for Hong Kong's success as an international financial and trade centre. It is also the story of the common law in a Chinese context and the values of Hong Kong’s citizens reflected in the Basic Law, local ordinances and case law. In this course, students will examine the background of the legal system, the sources of Hong Kong law, the SAR government and the challenges and future directions of the Hong Kong legal system. Topics include: the historical development of Hong Kong's legal system; governance in Hong Kong; the law-making process ; the separation of powers and judicial independence; the legal profession; and access to justice. The course will include a discussion of the interface between Hong Kong and the PRC legal systems.",

      "description": "This course provides law students with an introductory overview of the history, structure and basic principles of the legal system in the PRC. Students will examine: the historical and cultural origins of contemporary Chinese law; the special characteristics that distinguish Chinese law from other major legal systems of the world, especially the legal system of Hong Kong; and the role of law in modern Chinese economy and society. Topics include: Chinese legal tradition; modern law reform in China; the development of the Chinese constitution; Chinese legislative organs and processes; the sources of Chinese law; Chinese courts and judicial reform; administrative and judicial procedures; the legal profession; legal education; legal research; and 'One Country Two Systems' in Chinese law. A central component of the course is an introduction to the skills and methods essential to the study and practice of Chinese law (e.g., statutory interpretation, case analysis, legal research, legal writing and dispute resolution). This course serves as a foundation course for the study of more specialist courses on Chinese law.",

Throughout the course, students will learn to evaluate the part played by contracts in facilitating economic and social co-ordination in a free community,with particular reference to Hong Kong's context. Students will be introduced to the common law's methods, techniques and core values while developing their problem-solving, research, writing and advocacy skills. Students will gain an understanding of the differences and similarities between voluntarily assumed obligations in contract and involuntarily imposed obligations in tort. Topics include: contract formation (offer and acceptance, certainty of terms, consideration, estoppel and formalities); contractual terms (implied terms, conditions, warranties and innominate terms); parties (privity and capacity); discharge of contracts (by performance, by agreement, by frustration and by breach); remedies for breach of contract (damages, penalty clauses, specific performance, injunctions, exemption and limitation clauses); factors defeating contractual liability (illegality, public policy, misrepresentation, mistake, non est factum, duress, undue influence and unconscionability). This course deals with the rules and principles governing enforceable agreements generally and does not focus on special rules affecting specific types of contract such as employment, insurance, carriage or sale of goods.",

Topics include: contract formation (offer and acceptance, certainty of terms, consideration, estoppel and formalities); contractual terms (implied terms, conditions, warranties and innominate terms); parties (privity and capacity); discharge of contracts (by performance, by agreement, by frustration and by breach); remedies for breach of contract(damages, penalty clauses, specific performance, injunctions, exemption and limitation clauses); factors defeating contractual liability (illegality, public policy, misrepresentation, mistake, non est factum, duress, undue influence and unconscionability). This course deals with the rules and principles governing enforceable agreements generally and does not focus on special rules affecting specific types of contract such as employment, insurance, carriage or sale of goods.",

      "description": "Constitutional Law is a branch of public law. It consists of the rules and principles that establish a political community’s important public institutions, conferring powers on those institutions, defining the relationship among those institutions, and providing mechanisms for resolving disputes between them. Constitutions also define the relationship between public institutions and citizens and establish the basic rights of citizens. This course deals with the main constitutional principles and institutions in Hong Kong. Throughout the course students will be expected to evaluate and discuss the part played by the Basic Law in fostering the rule of law, accommodating political, economic and social change, and mediating Hong Kong’s 150-year common law heritage with its new status as a Special Administrative Region of the PRC enjoying ‘a high degree of autonomy.’ Students will be introduced to the methods and techniques of public law developing their writing, analytical and discussion skills. Topics covered include: introduction to the study of constitutional law; Hong Kong’s constitutional development before and after 1997; the Sino-British Joint Declaration; the Basic Law (structure, content, interpretation, and amendment); branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial); law-making; judicial review; fundamental rights and freedoms; and the relationship between the Basic Law and the PRC Constitution. Students will be encouraged to reflect upon the meaning of the rule of law, the role of law in the relationship between State and citizen, and the boundaries between different branches of the State.",

      "description": "This course will introduce you to Hong Kong company law, with primary focus on the company limited by shares. Since a company is a vehicle created by law to serve certain needs, you will learn the reasons why companies have taken their current form of organization, how this organization operates, and the problems that this organization entails, including: the extent to which shareholders may control a company while delegating power to the board of directors, the “agency problems” created by delegating power to the board, the problems that arise for company creditors because shareholders can cause distributions of the company’s assets to themselves, and the risk of majority shareholders abusing the rights of minority shareholders. We will study the organizational and governance rules that apply to private, public and – to a certain extent – listed companies",

During the first third of the course, we will examine the members’ powers and how these powers are exercised, as well as how members may seek recourse in court against other members’ unfairly prejudicial actions. The next third of the course will examine major corporate transactions and their result: listing the company on a stock exchange, reorganizing a company, purchasing a company by takeover and merging one company into another.

It consists of the rules and principles that regulate the making of decisions by the executive branch of government and agencies of the government. In this course, students will be introduced to both the substantive legal rules and principles that must be observed by the government for a decision to be lawful and the procedural avenues by which the lawfulness of a governmental decision may be challenged. The substantive rules and principles of administrative law in Hong Kong are mostly derived from the common law. Throughout the course, students will discuss the extent to which the rules, principles and procedures of administrative law in Hong Kong: 1) constrain and control governmental decision-making; 2) operate as a practical mechanism for the protection of civil liberties and economic freedom; 3) buttress the rule of law; and 4) aid transparency and accountability of public administration. Students will also be introduced to the methods and techniques of public law while developing their problem-solving, research and writing skills. Topics discussed include: grounds of review; delegated legislation and decision making by delegates; access to information and the duty to provide reasons; judicial review by the High Court; and non-curial review by tribunals, the Ombudsman and other agencies.",

The emphasis of the course will be on the development of a sound understanding of the principles of criminal law and their application to particular offences. Topics will include: the nature of criminal law; the “structure” of criminal offences including the notions of actus reus and mens rea and the place of defences; offences of strict, vicarious and corporate liability; the definition of crimes such as murder, manslaughter, assault, and rape.",

      "description": "Torts are legally enforceable civil obligations which do not depend on any prior agreement between the parties. They cover a very broad range of misconduct from carelessness while driving a car resulting in injury to publishing an untrue report that damages the reputation of another person. Torts are among the most frequently encountered legal issues in daily life. As with the law regulating contracts, the law regulating torts is a principal foundation of the Common Law. Throughout the course, students will discuss the part played by torts in maintaining and promoting: 1) social and economic order; and 2) responsible and respectful conduct, based on the community's own customs, traditions and expectations. Students will also be introduced to the common law's methods, techniques and core values while developing their problem-solving, research and writing skills. Topics include: scope of tort law and general principles of liability; negligence (standard of care, duty of care including pure economic loss and nervous shock, causation and remoteness, defences and contributory negligence); assessment of damages for personal injuries; employers' liability for injuries to employees; vicarious liability; strict liability; defamation; occupiers' liability; breach of statutory duty;nuisance; trespass; detinue; conversion; defences to intentional torts; and remedies for intentional torts.",

They cover a very broad range of misconduct from carelessness while driving a car resulting in injury to publishing an untrue report that damages the reputation of another person. Torts are among the most frequently encountered legal issues in dailylife. As with the law regulating contracts, the law regulating torts is a principal foundation of the Common Law. Throughout the course, students will discuss the part played by torts in maintaining and promoting: 1) social and economic order; and 2) responsible and respectful conduct, based on the community's own customs, traditions and expectations. Students will also be introduced to the common law's methods, techniques and core values while developing their problem-solving, research and writing skills. Topics include: scope of tort law and general principles of liability; negligence (standard of care, duty of care including pure economic loss and nervous shock, causation and remoteness, defences and contributory negligence); assessment of damages for personal injuries; employers' liability for injuries to employees; vicarious liability; strict liability; defamation; occupiers' liability; breach of statutory duty; nuisance; trespass; detinue; conversion; defences to intentional torts; and remedies for intentional torts.",

      "description": "Hong Kong's legal system has its roots in the common law of England. In this course, students will explore the development of the English legal system and the common law from its origins, and they will consider the role that it has played in shaping the development of Hong Kong. Students will discuss the ways in which law, politics and society have interacted at different stages of history. They will attain a deeper understanding of the rationale underpinning the most important rules and principles of common law and equity while gaining a deeper appreciation of the common law's core values. Students will also be introduced to the methods and techniques of legal historiography while developing their problem-solving, research and writing skills. Legal history is a broad and varied field. Topics may include: the origins of the common law in the reigns of Henry II and Richard I; the Magna Carta; the early history of contract and tort; the struggle for supremacy between crown and parliament;legal consolidation in the eighteenth century; the emergence of the civil law system in continental Europe; the impact of the industrial revolution on the common law; the reception of the common law in Hong Kong; and the impact of the common law on Hong Kong's economic, social and political development during the colonial period and since establishment of the Hong Kong SAR. Topics may also include areas of special interest to faculty members teaching the course.",

      "description": "This course is about the makeup and breakdown of the law of the sea treaty regime.In September 2013, the United States, a non-signatory of the UN Convention on Law of the Sea, signed the latest in a number of maritime boundary conventions, this time with Kiribati. And in March 2014, China, a signatory of the Convention, deflected a Filipino submission to the Permanent Court of Arbitration over claims to parts of the South China Sea. These not atypical developments suggest that the modern law of the sea regime — put into place by three conferences held in 1958, 1960, and 1973-1982 — may not be as necessary, or as effective, as its proponents had once believed. Codifying the law of the sea was a hugely ambitious project, pushing at sovereignty’s last frontier before outer space. First, it aimed to absorb customary law on the territorial sea, the continental shelf, the high seas, and fishing, into a treaty regime. Second, it articulated new international law concepts such as ‘exclusive economic zone’, ‘archipelagic state’, and transit passage through international straits. And finally, it offered a range of options for dispute resolution, which, provided states did not opt out of the regime, demanded that once a decision was handed down, states were bound to abide by them. Two issues have dominated the development of the regime: international security and the exploitation of resources. The powerful maritime states have sought the right of innocent passage through territorial waters and EEZs, and pushed for rights when traversing the high seas, archipelagos and straits. At the same time, the coastal states have laid claim to expanded territorial waters, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and greater control over the resources within them. The concerns over security and resources have touched every component of the Convention, from the protection of the marine environment, to the conduct of scientific research. Some tensions have not been resolved, and the coming period may see the fraying, if not the unravelling, of the current arrangements.",

Students will be introduced to quantitative and qualitative research methods and the ethics of undertaking research. Through working in groups to critically examine socio-legal problems, it is envisaged that students will gain an understanding of the role of lawyers in a practical sense in relation to the needs of different groups in society with a view to developing a life-long commitment to public interest law; and helping them deliver practical benefits to the wider community. This course will involve a range of teaching methods including interactive lectures and group tutoring. In addition to independent learning, students will be expected to develop research proposals in groups. Guest speakers will be invited so that students can benefit from their specialist knowledge.",

      "description": "In this course students will examine the fundamental principles governing the adducing of evidence within the adversarial framework of the common law. Students will gain a critical appreciation of the burden of proof in criminal and civil cases, the rules governing the admissibility of evidence, the roles of the judge and the parties, and the course of the trial. Students will be able to place the rules of evidence within their wider historical, social, and psychological contexts, using case studies to exemplify particular issues in evidence. The course will help students enhance their problem-solving, legal research, and writing skills. Topics include: relevance and admissibility; presumptions and the burden of proof; competence and compellability of witnesses; prior inconsistent statements; character; expert witnesses; confessions; unlawfully-obtained evidence; and identification evidence.",

Students will learn about the general theory and concepts that underpin modern civil and commercial law in China and examine their application in selected areas of law. The course focuses on a comparative understanding of Chinese civil law in relation to Hong Kong common law and international commercial law and introduces critical insights into the civil law from a cross-disciplinary perspective. Students will use case studies to learn the method of civil law analysis case, and they will improve the essential skills of legal research, writing and presentation in the context of Chinese civil law. Topics include both the general doctrines of Chinese civil law (e.g., civil legal relationships, persons, things, civil juristic acts and prescription) and a selected number of particular areas of civil law (e.g., contracts, torts, unjust enrichment, real rights, personal rights and succession). This course serves as a foundation for the study of more specialized courses on Chinese civil and commercial law.",

There are various ways of categorizing the personal property asset: these include as chattels real and personal, as chose in action and chose in possession, as tangibles and intangibles, and as future and present property. There are principles, common to all forms of personalty, which are used to identify the nature of the asset, the manner of the creation of interests, and the use of the asset as collateral for security or as quasi-security. The course will analyse how these traditional principles have been adapted to modern commercial law; how they can be used in the \"invention\" of novel interests and transactions; and how they can be adjusted to suit the variety of personal property assets. Topics will include: the principles common to both personalty and realty: the use of a chose in action as a commercial asset; the forms of personalty such as intellectual property rights, derivatives, shares, vehicles and equipment; the ability to use the physical state of chose in possession for sound security; and the recognition of the need for a valid,underlying contract when using an asset for commerce.",

The law of succession deals with the first of these, as society seeks to find rules of certainty and permanence so that the wishes of a deceased person can be respected. The law of succession is about who inherits what when someone dies and how society values and protects the wishes of a deceased person. It protects the interests of the beneficiaries under a will and those who inherit when a will is invalid or when there is no will. It sets out the rules on what makes a will 'valid' in law and the exact words that must be used. Its importance to the rule of law is incalculable in terms of certainty and predictability. In this course, students will learn the law of succession and explore the values inherent in the current system. Topics include: the Hong Kong rules governing the drafting and interpretation of a valid will; the revocation and operation of awill and the rules relating to testate and intestate inheritance; the role of the Executor and Administrator; and aspects of the rules relating to the Probate Registry in Hong Kong.",

      "description": "On 26 August 1789, six weeks after Parisians had stormed the Bastille, the French National Assembly passed the Declaration of the Rights of Man – a momentous document that encapsulated the liberating principles of the Enlightenment. The very first article advanced the visionary idea that: ‘Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.’ This simple phrase asserted the supremacy of the rights of all human beings over the narrow privileges of an aristocratic elite. Henceforth, people would be defined — in theory, at least — by their common claim to freedom and equality, rather then by their allotted place in a God-given social hierarchy. Human rights had arrived.The fervour of the revolution soon abated, and, in the century and a half that followed, advances in rights took place in piecemeal fashion, mainly within the walls of the nation state. International campaigns emerged from time to time — but it was not until the Second World War that states felt compelled to develop a comprehensive international legal regime dealing with the rights of the individual. It was only then that the now-familiar global laws, treaties and tribunals devoted to upholding these rights, and punishing those who abuse them, began to take shape.This course focuses on the development of the international human rights regimes within public international law, and their impact on modern case law. Concentrating on the nine core treaties and the one core protocol, it covers the ‘political’ rights (such as the right to life, and the freedoms of expression and association); the ‘economic’ and ‘social’ rights (such as the rights to employment, education and leisure time); and some of the more recently codified rights (such as the rights of the child and of people with disabilities). Each session aims to situate international resolutions, treaties and protocols in their legal and political context, while also assessing their impact on contemporary cases drawn from jurisdictions around the world. In process, they will show that in this area of law, appearances are often deceptive, and issues are never black-and-white.",

PTAs, either in the form of a Free Trade Area (FTA) or in the form of a Customs Union (CU), aim to eliminate trade barriers among their parties. Accordingly, they are instruments of bilateral and regional economic integration. This course critically presents the law and policy of bilateral and regional economic integration in the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO).",

      "description": "Ensuring secure and reliable energy supply in a climate-friendly and socially responsible way is one of the most important challenges that most states around the world are facing today. These challenges are particularly acute in Hong Kong given the limited availability of natural resources and the high burden that energy production – in particular electricity generation – imposes on society. Law has a crucial role to play in the re-organization of energy supply towards more secure, cost efficient and sustainable patterns. In this context, energy law is becoming an increasingly important field of legal practice and research.This course examines the main principles of energy law from an international and comparative law perspective – with a specific interest for the legal challenges characterizing the organization of the Hong Kong and Chinese energy sector. The focus is on the liberalization of the HK and Chinese energy markets (i.e. opening of the energy markets to competition) and the de-carbonization of energy supply (i.e. the re-orientation of the energy system towards climate-friendly patterns). The objective of this course is to equip students with the necessary tools to apply the main concepts of energy law to concrete situations, e.g. the conclusion of energy contracts, access to the energy network infrastructure and the realization of energy investments.",

      "description": "With continuing trends of declining fertility rates and increasing life expectancies, many advanced industrialised and industrialising countries are undergoing a seismic socio-demographic transformation. In our region, Hong Kong and the PRC are among the fastest ageing societies in the world. The number of senior citizens aged 65 and above in Hong Kong is predicted to rise from the current 1 million (13 per cent of total population) to 2.6 million (30 per cent of projected population) by 2041. Ageing issues have attracted growing attention across a wide range of public policy arenas such as the economy, labour market, pensions, taxation, health, social care, housing, environment and migration among other areas.This course provides students with a comprehensive overview of the legal issues most pertinent to the lives of older persons today. As societies around the world are confronted with rapidly ageing populations, many countries have adopted a range of legal and regulatory approaches to addressing issues such as age discrimination, in/capacity and old age, care of the elderly, elder abuse and exploitation, pensions and income maintenance, inheritance, among others. This course adopts an international and comparative approach to examine the legal issues and legal treatment of older people in ageing societies in Hong Kong, PRC, regionally, and globally. It introduces students to the demographic, social, economic, and cultural contexts within which the law and/or other forms of regulation respond to ageing issues in different societies.",

Students are encouraged to apply their legal knowledge in developing socio-legal research projects in conjunction with and for the benefit of selected groups such as school children, domestic workers, defendants in criminal cases, minority groups in Hong Kong, prisoners and unrepresented litigants. Students will be introduced to quantitative and qualitative research methods and the ethics of undertaking research. Through completing a research proposal, students will develop an appreciation of the role of socio-legal research in exposing the strengths, weakness and limitations of the law. Students will acquire practical experience in engaging with their classmates and members of the wider community. Through working in groups to critically examine a socio-legal problem, it is envisaged that students will gain an insight into the construction of social problems, the context of law in society, and understanding of the role of law in a practical sense. The research proposals produced in this course will serve as a springboard to future courses such as the independent research paper or legal clinical courses where students can take their proposals and subsequently implement them in these courses. In other words, students may choose to carry out the socio-legal research project and submit it as their independent research paper (LAWS4010).

It is designed to examine the role of storytelling in law, and the role of law, legal reasoning, and legal institutions in literary works.It examines two commonly-discussed sub-fields: “law-in-literature” and “law-as-literature”. Law-in-literature focuses on the depiction of law and jurisprudential issues in works of literature. It aims at exploring questions such as what insights works of literature can contribute to the study of law and in what ways literature enhances our understanding of the law. Law-as-literature examines legal opinions, arguments, and concepts through a literary lens – as works or elements of literature – exploring the similarities law shares with literature and focusing on the construction of narratives by lawyers, judges, and other legal actors to advance our understanding of the law.You will also be invited to go beyond considerations of law and literature to consider law’s relationship to culture and society as a whole. This course will provide you with an opportunity to think about the law in a new way and to participate in an interdisciplinary discussion of the larger questions of law and life.In each class, we will explore one or more interrelated topics through a variety of literary and legal works of short to moderate length. Readings will include judicial opinions by judges in different jurisdictions and literary works by writers across cultures.",

Students in this course will develop a broad knowledge and understanding of the U.S. Constitution, the structure of American government, the criminal and civil justice systems, and the legal profession. This knowledge will serve them well in international legal practice and in any further studies they may pursue in the United States.

The course is organised thematically and analyses film and legal process from a variety of jurisdictions across the globe. It explores how key legal issues, procedures, and actors are represented on film and how these representations in popular culture in turn influence understandings of the law, and in certain circumstances even its development. In particular, the module will focus on the genre of documentary film because of its commitment to authenticity and investigation of reality, while giving the students the freedom to explore feature films, TV series, and podcasts.",

      "description": "This course examines the legal aspects of the presence of digital platforms in a globalized world, with emphasis on the developments in Hong Kong, Mainland China, the United States and the European Union. Platform ecosystems reach virtually every aspect of our lives, and their ‘gatekeeping’ allows firms and their prospective customers to connect. Their business model has created new markets and reshaped Internet governance, with the potential to boost consumer choice and job creation. At the same time, the power amassed by gatekeepers allows them to shape the conduct of consumers, affect competitors, and control the content we access online, raising significant legal concerns. All of this needs to be analyzed against the backdrop of a fierce United States-China tech war that is leaving an imprint on the legal framework, and the European Union’s stark commitment to protecting its citizens from the risks of unchecked power (seen by some as regulatory zealotry).The course will cover key issues like platform governance, liability for online intermediaries, online data protection and content moderation, the role of competition law in controlling the power of digital gatekeepers, the regulation of platform workers, and conflicts of law arising over cross-border data governance or taxation matters.

      "description": "Hong Kong is a small but highly international jurisdiction. Many legal disputes between private parties in Hong Kong involve legal rules, principles and issues from elsewhere in China or abroad. These other laws are frequently inconsistent with the law in Hong Kong. For instance, a contract concluded between a Hong Kong company and a US company in Japan may contain clauses that are enforceable in Japanese law but not in Hong Kong. In this course, students will study the rules and principles that exist for resolving conflicts that arise between Hong Kong law and the law of other jurisdictions. The rules of Private International Law (sometimes known as Conflict of Laws) are orientated to answering three questions: 1) Which law applies in the event of a conflict? 2) Do Hong Kong courts have jurisdiction to determine the dispute, and should they exercise jurisdiction? 3) Should a HongKong court recognize and enforce a foreign court's judgment? These questions are examined in a few selected areas such as contracts, torts, family law, criminal law and property.",

The exact schedule of submission can be arranged by the course leader, but should follow a rough ‘one post per two month’ pattern. After review and approval by the course leader, the posts will appear on a publicly-accessible subsite of the CUHK Law webpage highlighting our students’ participation in this innovative LLB-LLM programme. Each post will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Students must successfully complete all four posts to pass the course. Students may also propose substitutions for written posts, provided that the overall content is aligned with the goals of the course and is in a format that it can in some way be published on the CUHK Faculty of Law website (eg a video). Any such substitution must be approved in advance by the course leader.",

      "description": "As the Common Law developed and matured over centuries, its rules and principles assumed progressively more definite shape, sometimes to the point of rigidity. Individual cases increasingly occurred in which it became impossible to apply the relatively strict requirements of the Common Law while simultaneously achieving a result which accorded with basic requirements of justice. The response of the English legal system was to accommodate a parallel system of courts whose task was, in appropriate circumstances, to temper the application of the Common Law with principles derived from elementary considerations of fairness – or equity. Among the more important contributions of equity is the trust, which enables a person to acquire an enforceable interest in something when another person is the legal owner. The flexibility of equity and the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery also allowed equity to develop a series of remedies which were far more powerful than the common law: amongst these the injunction, specific performance, equitable account and the doctrine of subrogation are very important today in a commercial context. Throughout the course students will learn to evaluate the part played by equity and trusts in: (1) accommodating the law to elementary requirements of justice and fairness; and (2) the suitability of that accommodation to the social, economic, and historical circumstances of Hong Kong. In this course students will develop their problem-solving, research, and writing skills. Topics include: the history and nature of equity; the relationship between the Common Law and equity; the nature and types of trusts; the creation of trusts; trust anomalies; assignments and disposition of equitable interests; and remedies.",

      "description": "This module builds on the understanding of equity and trusts developed in LAWS4151.Equity and Trusts II will consider the development of fiduciary obligations and the use of equitable principles to deal with wrongdoing by fiduciaries.As the law of trusts developed the rights, duties and liabilities of the actors in trust relationships have changed, especially the role of trustee, which may now require a degree of professionalism and business acumen when dealing with protecting the trust fund and administering beneficiaries’ interests. The importance of the wishes of the person who creates the trust, the settler or testator, has also changed as the Court has been willing to vary the terms of the trust in various circumstances. Apart from trusts, Equity has also provided modern commerce with the basis of professional relationships: the fiduciary. The company director owes a fiduciary duty to the company and the remedies available to the company for his wrongdoings are equitable. Similarly professional duties of confidentiality are based on fiduciary principles. Over the centuries, whereas the common law was restricted to the remedy of damages, Equity developed a series of flexible and powerful remedies, such as: subpoena; equitable account; subrogation; and rescission. Foremost amongst these was the injunction, which can be used to stop someone doing something or make them do it. Equity also developed flexible principles for tracing misappropriated property into the hands of the wrongdoer and third parties. Throughout the course students will learn to evaluate the part played by equity and trusts in: (1) accommodating the law to elementary requirements of justice and fairness; and (2) the suitability of that accommodation to the social, economic, and historical circumstances of Hong Kong. In this course students will develop their problem-solving, research, and writing skills.Topics include: duties in trust relationships; powers of trustees; remedies for breach of trust; variation of trusts; trusts of the family home; tracing; and the liability of strangers to the trust.",

In contrast almost all legal systems are to a certain extent 'mixed' or 'mixing' (i.e. have incorporated or are incorporating legal structures that have been developed in other legal systems). Internationalization and globalization also lead to increasing numbers of cross-border activities requiring the concerned parties to consider multi-jurisdictional issues. Consequently, comparative legal work is gaining in importance. This course is designed to give credit to the growing practical significance of comparative legal work. Students will examine the meaning and the instrumentality of comparative law, explore how various systems are adapting to change, and critically analyse traditional concepts. They will also appreciate the insights that adopting a comparative law approach brings while developing new perspectives in this area. Topics include: the concept of comparative law and its significance in practice; the methods and history of comparative law; the (traditional) euro-centric approach of comparative law; the (traditional) private law-centered approach of comparative law; mixed and harmonized legal systems; and a comparison of major private law concepts, major constitutional and administrative law concepts and major criminal law concepts",

The clinic is run in partnership with legal agencies and non-governmental organisations (Clinic Partner) in Hong Kong. A full list of current Clinic Partners is provided in Annex 1. Proposals for additional Clinic Partners may only be approved by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies.In partnership with a selected number of Clinic Partners, the CPIA will place up to 30 CUHK law students each term in positions of responsibility to either (i) provide supervised assistance to disadvantaged and vulnerable members of the community or (ii) spearhead advocacy campaigns that are aimed at enhancing the legal interests of such individuals in Hong Kong. All of our clinic partners share the aim of using the law to protect individual rights, advance social justice and enhance interests common to the community.In addition to the clinical placement, there will also be a taught component of the course which is focused on developing knowledge and skills on (i) public interest law in Hong Kong, (ii) legal strategies to protect the rights of individuals, particularly via judicial review and (iii) legal advocacy in a formal setting.Course StructureStudents are required to participate in ALL components of the clinic course in order to receive full academic credit:1. Clinic: All students are required to attend their Clinic Partner office over a 13 week period. Participation in the clinic will expose students to a diverse range of issues including refugee and migrants rights, foreign domestic workers rights, gender and sexual health. Clinic responsibilities may involve, but are not restricted to, casework, client interviews, team meetings, research assistance and potentially a research or advocacy project related to a public interest cause.Students will be expected to attend the office of the Clinic Partner for the equivalent of 8 hours per week under the supervision of a Clinic Partner Supervisor (for a list of names of current supervisors see Annex 1). This will be handled in a flexible manner depending on the needs of the clinic partner and will be by way of agreement with the student in light of their other course demands.2. Seminars: All students are required to attend six two-hour seminars taught by Faculty staff during the term. These seminars will cover the following: • Introduction to Public Interest Issues in Hong Kong• International Human Rights Systems and Mechanisms• Domestic Human Rights Systems and Mechanisms• Judicial Review Procedures• Public Law Mechanisms: Administrative Review (Advocacy Skills 1)• Public Law Mechanisms: Judicial Review (Advocacy Skills 2)3. Advocacy: Students will participate in a number of simulated advocacy exercises during the seminars leading to a final assessment pertaining to an application for administrative review. A particular focus will be the preparation of a skeleton argument (3,000 words) for an oral application seeking leave for judicial review before the Hong Kong Court of First Instance.",

Many of these constraints emanate from the operation of private law, namely the law of real property and the law of contract. However, the most fundamental and wide-ranging constraints are imposed by the state through the operation of the planning system. Planning law is a branch of public law that is concerned with the regulation of land development in the public interest. It provides the forum for resolving disputes between those who wish to develop land and those who want to ensure that such development does not harm the environment or destroy public amenity. In this course, students will learn to identify the problems/conflicts engendered by land development and to evaluate potential methods of resolution or management. It is against this backdrop that students will also explore the origins, development and rationale of the planning system in Hong Kong, as well as receiving a comprehensive education in the detailed rules and regulations which currently govern development of land. Topics include: public participation in planning; the plan making process; development control; protection of areas and interests of special importance; and the resolution of planning disputes.",

In this course, students will explore the cultural, social and legal dimensions of this supranational trade and economic law. They will consider how national governments have responded to the demands of the international investor and the 'global ethics of business'. Students will also examine and evaluate the role of international trade organizations, such as the World Bank and the WTO, and the underlying value system that must now be adopted by all developing nations in order to participate in global capitalism.

A contract will establish rights and obligations of insurance when it transfers the financial risk of a specified event from the party who would normally bear the risk to one or more other parties. Insurance contracts are often critically important in business because they give parties greater assurance, thereby encouraging more adventurous risk-taking and a more dynamic economy. They are also valuable in daily life by giving reassurance that death, accidents or illness need not prove financially ruinous to individuals and families. In this course, students will examine the special rules and principles that have emerged to regulate contracts of insurance. Throughout the course, students will consider the impact of insurance law on the economic and social life of the community. Topics include: the nature of insurance, and insurance as contract; types of insurance (e.g., life, motor vehicle, fire, casualty, marine, health and disability, liability, title); the insurance proposal; the obligation of utmost good faith and disclosure; indemnity and non-indemnity contracts; insurable interest; the definition of risk; persons insured; insurer's defences; limits of liability; subrogation; and third-party rights.",

      "description": "Tax law often plays a very significant role when it comes to making business decisions in all jurisdictions including Mainland China. Students will acquire an in-depth understanding of the Chinese tax system. They will come to understand the historical development of the Chinese tax regimes and the political, cultural, economic, and social factors that have shaped and continue to shape the enactment and the implementation of related rules in practice. The course begins with a general discussion of tax concepts and their meaning for Mainland China in general. Thereafter students will consider how the Chinese tax system has developed over the years, focusing on its contours and its problems. The course primarily focuses on the rules governing the most important Chinese tax types, namely individual income tax, income tax imposed on enterprises with and without foreign investment, value-added tax, business tax and consumption tax (as well as environmental taxes of expanded scope). During the course, students will learn about the current discussion to reform the PRC tax system and the potential significance of these reforms for the different concerned parties. Throughout the course students will develop their problem-solving, legal research, writing, and presentation skills to an appropriate undergraduate level.",

The Course will allow students the opportunity to explore and research further into those aspects of Hong Kong law that they have already studied as part of the LLB curriculum. Students will teach from materials based upon the Faculty’s archive of ‘The Individual, The Community and The Law’ research projects. Students will therefore build on and consolidate their knowledge, skills, values and attitudes as they explore these issues in depth. This Course will also provide a significant theoretical and applied learning experience for Final Year law students preparing for the workplace as they develop their presentation and organisational skills through self-directed learning on topics of major substantive knowledge gained though the study of law. Final Year law students selected for this course will teach Law and Liberal Studies classes as part of the Liberal Studies Curriculum in Secondary Schools. In addition law students will be required to attend Faculty of Law Seminars on The Teaching of Law as Liberal Studies and to submit a 4000 word reflective essay on Teaching Law as Liberal Studies at the end of the Course. The Course Leader will co-ordinate with the teachers in the Secondary Schools to ensure standards and to evaluate the law students’ performance. The law students selected for this Course will be known as The Sir TL Yang Teaching Fellows for the purposes of this Course and will be expected to conduct themselves accordingly in all dealings with the Secondary Schools and pupils.",

      "description": "Individuals – willingly or otherwise – tend to generate significant amounts of information in the course of their daily lives. This information can be processed by both state and non-state actors to generate profiles that may help predict future behaviour. While such categorization may in some circumstances be benign or even desired by the subject, if the information processing is unwanted or unknown it may implicate individual autonomy in important ways. This course will consider the normative values that may be threatened by various kinds of information gathering and processing, and consider what legal protections – if any – may be appropriate. Students will be exposed to the regulatory regimes and legal frameworks that govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in both Hong Kong and in other jurisdictions. We will consider laws and policies that apply to both the private and the public sectors, and the ways in which they differ. Students will be encouraged to reflect upon different philosophical accounts of privacy, and consider which one is best reflected by the Hong Kong legal system. Students will consider how best privacy can (or should) be balanced off against commercial or government interests in the personal information of individuals. Thematic topics will include (but will not be limited to) the surveillance of public space for commercial purposes, privacy and online social networks, the coming rise of ‘wearable’ computing, the warrantless collection of ‘metadata’ by the state, and the privacy implications of cloud computing. This course incorporates an extended range of mandatory readings and students will be expected to extensively participate orally in the classroom. A research paper on a related topic of the student’s choosing will be the primary form of assessment.",

This course considers the meaning of the terms “art”, “antiquities” and “cultural heritage” and the legal frameworks which affect them in Hong Kong and internationally. The course begins by considering the use of these terms and the distinct and overlapping laws which affect them. The course continues considering the issues affecting the ownership, transfer and protection of art, antiquities and cultural heritage in Hong Kong The rise of the art and antiquities market in China will be considered and the unusual position of Hong Kong as a market for Chinese artifacts in the legitimate and illicit global trade in art and antiques and its position in the illicit trade will also be considered. The issues of illicit trafficking of art, antiquities and cultural heritage will be considered and the use of art, antiquities and cultural heritage for money laundering and the financing of terror. The course will consider issues of repatriation of cultural property from private and public collections, for example the looting of the Summer Palace in Beijing. Recent issues involving the protection of heritage in armed conflict and the political value in protecting and/or destroying art, antiquities and cultural heritage will also be considered.",

The International Geological Congress agreed in August 2016 that we had entered the Anthropocene – a new geological age where human influence has a distinct impact on most planetary systems. Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have already caused an increase in global average temperature by 0.8 degrees Celsius and a raise of sea-level by 20 centimeters, triggering slow but dramatic planetary-wide adjustments. Efforts have been made to try to mitigate the disaster. Several treaties have been adopted since 1992. Under the US-China Joint Announcement of 2014 and the Paris Agreement of 2015, the world’s greatest economic actors agreed to accelerate and increase domestic measures. Substantial investments are being made to induce a global transition to “green” economy, with China progressively taking the lead. Hong Kong is bound by several treaties ratified by China. Hong Kong’s Climate Change Strategy and Action Agenda was adopted in 2010 and is being implemented through laws and policies in multiple sectors. Responses to climate change are increasingly impacting all aspects of the law, domestically and internationally. But is this sufficient? Will we, as a civilization and as a species, survive our entry in the Anthropocene?",

Following that, the course will explore several important episodes relating to the development of modern legal systems, including the significance of pirates and contestations over the law of the sea to the formation of the contemporary international legal order; the manner in which the colonial office in Britain attempted to expand its authority across an increasing extensive British Empire, including through the appointment of powerful chief executives and the use of demonstrative trials and commissions of inquiry; the legal evolution of the United States from settler colony to global power, and some of the unique features of the system that arose as a result; and select topics pertaining to the formation of the contemporary legal orders in Mainland China and Hong Kong. Alongside the lectures and discussions, students will develop independent research projects, which they will have a chance to present and share in the latter part of the course.",

      "description": "Mergers are the largest commercial transactions, and merger control is a fundamental part of competition law which regularly affects businesses in Hong Kong and around the world. Mergers between companies are frequent in the business world, and more than 100 countries have merger control laws that must be observed. Globalization inevitably implies that merger operations can bear effects on the conditions of competition in multiple jurisdictions, and therefore companies will have to ensure their operations comply with the laws of every jurisdiction that comes into play. Large transactions are often subject to scrutiny by several regimes simultaneously. As a consequence, companies need to be aware of the implications of the principal merger control regimes to avoid delays and uncertainty. Firms in Hong Kong whose operations might affect other markets regularly seek legal advice on merger control rules in jurisdictions such as the US, the EU and Mainland China.This course aims to provide students with a solid theoretical and practical understanding of the principal merger control regimes that affect companies in Hong Kong. On December 14, 2015, Hong Kong’s very own merger regime entered into force. For the time being, it only affects the telecommunications sector. The course will analyse local merger control rules as well as the rules of those regimes which most frequently apply to merger transactions involving local firms. Both procedural and substantive aspects are covered, and the principal focus of the course will be on substance.",

Anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, fraud prevention, social and environmental responsibility, product safety and personal data protection are major examples of compliance areas. Compliance is not only created from inside business: Government authorities and the judiciary also use compliance requirements as a tool to procure change within an organisation and as an alternative or complement to an administrative or criminal penalty.As an international business hub, major financial market and seat of global and regional headquarters Hong Kong has its own legislative, regulatory and industry compliance systems.

First is an introduction to the particular type of digital technology, how it works and what is does, or at least is supposed to do. The use of this digital technology is then considered in the practice of law. The final phase of consideration of this form of digital technology is how the law affects it, or does not, and how it affects or may affect the law. For example, one of the first topics covered will be artificial intelligence (AI). Artificial intelligence will first be defined and explained, and possible developments of artificial intelligence considered including developments in machine learning and strong AI. Then we will consider how lawyers are using artificial intelligence for eDiscovery and eDueDiligence, how they may use if to assist in legal research, how it may replace lawyers, and the future for robo-lawyers and robo-judges. Then we will consider how law affects artificial intelligence. For example, how has financial regulation developed to deal with machines making life changing decisions for humans, how has the law of torts responded to autonomous vehicles, how has criminal law and international humanitarian law responded to autonomous weapons. Finally, we will consider how the law may develop to regulate the development and use of artificial intelligence.

It is also the story of the common law in a Chinese context and the value system of Hong Kong people reflected in the Basic Law and constitutional principles. This course examines the background to the legal system, the sources of Hong Kong law, the SAR legal machine, and the idea of law as a value system. Throughout the course students are expected to identify the characteristics of the Hong Kong legal system and what makes law ‘legitimate’ in our society. By incorporating a more extended range of mandatory readings than undergraduate courses of similar length and a more research-focused assessment regime, this course is designed specifically for students at the postgraduate level who have not previously studied the Hong Kong legal system.

      "description": "Hong Kong is at the crossroads of many legal traditions. The practice of law in Hong Kong is marked not only by the common law tradition but also by socialist law and the civil law tradition. There are even traces left of the pre-colonial indigenous Chinese legal practices in Hong Kong. Globalization has increased the volume of cross-border activities beyond Hong Kong and mainland China, requiring lawyers to become familiar with multi-jurisdictional issues. Consequently, comparative legal work is gaining in importance both globally and in Hong Kong. This course is designed to prepare students to practice law in an international setting and to give credit to the growing practical significance of comparative legal work. Students will examine the meaning and instrumental benefits of comparative law, explore how various legal systems and traditions are adapting to change, learn about academic debates within comparative law, and critically analyse traditional concepts of comparative law. They will also learn to appreciate the insights of approaching legal systems through a comparative perspective. This course has an emphasis on Asian legal systems and the law of the People’s Republic of China, in particular.",

It will examine the birth, life, and death of a Hong Kong company with particular emphasis on the objectives of company law in the context of Hong Kong company law reform. It identifies issues raised by the protection of minority shareholders, majority rule, ‘lifting the veil’, and the protection of the outsider in the context of the twin company law legal concepts of limited liability and independent legal personality. By incorporating a more extended range of mandatory readings than undergraduate courses of similar length and a more research-focused assessment regime, this course is designed specifically for students at the postgraduate level who have not previously studied company law as it applies in a common law jurisdiction. Students are expected to make a presentation on a company law topic as part of the assessment of these skills. Topics covered include: definitions of a private and public company; the structure and formal arrangements of a Hong Kong private limited liability company; the ‘one-person company’; the constitution of a Hong Kong company; the allotment, issue, and transfer of shares; minority protection and legal remedies of shareholders; the appointment of company officers including directors; the powers and statutory duties of Hong Kong company directors; officers and the question of corporate authority; issues in corporate personality and the lifting of the veil; and sources of finance including fixed and floating charges, receiverships, and liquidation.",

It will examine the fundamental principles governing the adducing of evidence within the adversarial framework of the common law. By incorporating a more extended range of mandatory readings than undergraduate courses of similar length and a more research-focused assessment regime, this course is designed specifically for students at the postgraduate level who have not previously studied the law of evidence as it applies in a common law jurisdiction. In this course, students will gain a critical appreciation of the burden of proof in criminal and civil cases, the rules governing the admissibility of evidence, the roles of the judge and the parties, and the course of the trial. Students will be able to place the rules of evidence within their wider historical, social, and psychological contexts. The course will help students enhance their skills in problem-solving, legal research, and writing. Topics covered include: relevance and admissibility; presumptions and the burden of proof; competence and compellability of witnesses; prior inconsistent statements; character; expert witnesses; confessions; unlawfully-obtained evidence; and identification evidence.",

By incorporating a more extended range of mandatory readings than undergraduate courses of similar length and the opportunity for a more research-focused assessment regime, this course is designed specifically for students at the postgraduate level who have not previously studied the law relating to Hong Kong’s constitutional arrangements. In Hong Kong, the Basic Law performs the function of a local constitution. Throughout the course students will be expected to evaluate and discuss the part played by the Basic Law in (i) maintaining order and stability while accommodating political, economic and social change; and (ii) mediating the values of Hong Kong’s 150-year heritage as a British Crown Colony with its new status as a Special Administrative Region of the PRC enjoying ‘a high degree of autonomy’. Students will be introduced to the methods and techniques of public law while developing their problem-solving, research, and writing skills to a level appropriate for postgraduate studies. Topics covered include: constitutions and constitutionalism; colonial administration; Sino-British Joint Declaration; the Basic Law (structure, content, interpretation, and amendment); branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial); the nature and extent of legislative, executive, and judicial power; lawmaking in Hong Kong; judicial review; the relationship between the Basic Law and the Constitution of the PRC; democracy; the Bill of Rights; and external affairs and treaties.",

By incorporating a more extended range of mandatory readings than undergraduate courses of similar length and a more research-focused assessment regime, this course is designed specifically for students at the postgraduate level who have not previously studied commercial law in a common law jurisdiction. Commercial law involves different types of business relationships and interrelated financial transactions (including consumer credit and consumer protection). Students will develop their problem-solving skills by analyzing these relationships and the different types of commercial documents. Topics covered will include: the Sale of Goods Ordinance; issues in bankruptcy such as the doctrine of relation back (fraudulent preference); bills of exchange; personal property and interests in personal property; credit and security, including pledges, liens and mortgages and assignments of choses in action and guarantees; Nemo dat and exceptions in commercial law; the provisions of the Hong Kong consumer protection statutes (such as the Moneylenders Ordinance and the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance). This course will also briefly touch on retention of title and fixed and floating charges together with an overview of Romalpa clauses (but these will separately be examined in Principles of Company Law).",

It will cover concepts of leasehold estates, covenants in land, the creation and transfer of various forms of interest, ownership and title, the taking and enforcing securities in land, landlord and tenant, and land registration systems and priorities. This course is intertwined with other core subjects of common law such as equity and trusts, contract, and torts.

      "description": "This course deals with the main rules and principles regulating the making of decisions by the executive branch of government and government agencies in Hong Kong. By incorporating a more extended range of mandatory readings than undergraduate courses of similar length and a more research-focused assessment regime, this course is designed specifically for students at the postgraduate level who have not previously studied administrative law as it applies in a common law jurisdiction. This course deals with both the substantive legal rules and principles which must be observed by the government in order for a decision to be lawful, and the procedural avenues by which the lawfulness of a governmental decision may be challenged. Throughout the course students will be expected to evaluate and discuss the extent to which the rules, principles, and procedures of administrative law in Hong Kong (i) constrain and control governmental decision making; (ii) operate as a practical mechanism for the protection of civil liberties and economic freedom; (iii) buttress the rule of law; and (iv) aid transparency and accountability of public administration. Students will also be further introduced to the methods and techniques of public law while developing their problem-solving, research, and writing skills to a level appropriate for postgraduate studies. Topics covered include: grounds of review (ultra vires, error of law, unreasonableness and proportionality, irrelevant considerations, failure to take account of relevant considerations, bad faith, bias, conflict of interest and duty, and natural justice); delegated legislation and decision making by delegates; access to information and the duty to provide reasons; judicial review by the High Court; and non-curial review by tribunals, the Ombudsman and other agencies.",

      "description": "This course deals with the main rules and principles regulating torts in Hong Kong. By incorporating a more extended range of mandatory readings than undergraduate courses of similar length and a more research-focused assessment regime, this course is designed specifically for students at the postgraduate level who have not previously studied the law of tort as it applies in a common law jurisdiction. Torts are legally enforceable civil obligations that do not depend on any prior agreement between the parties. They are among the most frequently encountered legal issues in daily life. As with the law regulating contracts, the law regulating torts is a principal foundation of the common law. Throughout the course students will be expected to evaluate and discuss the part played by torts in maintaining and promoting (i) social and economic order, and (ii) responsible and respectful conduct, based on the community’s own customs, traditions, and expectations. Students will also be further introduced to the common law’s methods, techniques, and core values while developing their problem-solving, research, writing, and information literacy skills to a level appropriate for postgraduate studies. Topics covered include: the scope of tort law and general principles of liability; negligence (standard of care, duty of care including pure economic loss and nervous shock, causation and remoteness, defences, contributory negligence); assessment of damages for personal injuries; employers’ liability for injuries to employees; vicarious liability; strict liability and the rule in Rylands v Fletcher; occupiers’ liability; defamation; breach of statutory duty; nuisance; trespass (to persons, to land, to goods); detinue; conversion; defences to intentional torts; and remedies for intentional torts.",

      "description": "Hong Kong is a small, but highly international, jurisdiction. Many legal disputes between private parties in Hong Kong involve legal rules, principles, and issues from other jurisdictions in China and abroad. These foreign laws are frequently inconsistent with the laws in Hong Kong. For instance, a contract concluded between a Hong Kong company and a US company in Japan may contain clauses that are enforceable in Japanese law but not in Hong Kong law. This course involves a study of the rules and principles for resolving conflicts that arise between Hong Kong law and the law of other jurisdictions. By incorporating a more extended range of mandatory readings than undergraduate courses of similar length and a more research-focused assessment regime, this course is designed specifically for students at the postgraduate level who have not previously studied the conflict of laws as it applies in a common law jurisdiction. The rules of Conflict of Laws (sometimes known as Private International Law) are orientated to answering three questions: (i) Which law applies in the event of a conflict? (ii) Do Hong Kong courts have jurisdiction to determine the dispute and should they exercise jurisdiction? (iii) Should a Hong Kong court recognise and enforce a foreign court’s judgment? These questions are examined in a few selected areas of law such as contracts, torts, family law, criminal law, and property.",

      "description": "The course covers the key components of the formation of the insurance contract, claims and the regulation of insurance business and insurance intermediaries. Although it does not cover marine insurance in its own right, reference will be made to the Marine Insurance Act 1906 and to the case law decided thereunder relevant to non-marine insurance contracts. The course is concerned with English law, but reference will be made to developments in other common law jurisdictions (e.g. the USA, Canada and Australia) in order to see how insurance law issues may receive different judicial/legislative responses elsewhere. References to Hong Kong will be included in the fuller description. Although many students will already have a background in contract law, this is not necessary for this course so it is suitable for someone from a non-common law background. Those who have such a background will be familiar with some aspects (e.g. the analysis of offer and acceptance in the formation of a contract), but not only does the course go beyond the type of analysis employed by courses on the general principles of contract law (e.g. the course looks at regulation), it will quickly become clear that an insurance contract has a number of features that mark it out from most other types of contract: for instance, it is one of the few contracts where parties have a duty of disclosure before the contract. In particular, the course covers the following topics: - Elements of insurance - definitions; regulation of insurance business. - Insurance intermediaries - regulation; insurance agents; insurance brokers. - Insurable interest - indemnity; life & property policies; joint & composite insurance. - Formation - common law principles; premiums; commencement of the risk; cover notes; renewals. - Utmost good faith - the mutual duty of disclosure; misrepresentation; remedies for breach of duty. - Terms - warranties; conditions. - Construction of the policy - rules of construction; specific terms. - Causation - doctrine of proximate cause; the assured's misconduct. - The claims process - notification clauses; fraudulent claims; claims co-operation, good faith obligations on the insured and the insurer. - Resolving disputes, including the role of the ombudsman. - Indemnity - the indemnity principle; valued and unvalued policies; mitigation of loss and 'due precautions' conditions. - Reinstatement - contractual reinstatement; reinstatement under statue.",

      "description": "Law remains the most enduring and impactful legacy of the Roman empire. Indeed, Rome possessed by far the most advanced and sophisticated system of law in antiquity. Its role as a progenitor of modern legal systems can hardly be overstated. Roman law is a foundation of virtually all modern Civil Law systems. It has also been an important influence in the development of the Common Law. Every educated lawyer should possess at least a basic understanding of Roman law, and every educated citizen should possess at least a basic knowledge of Roman history.This is a survey course on the Roman legal system and Roman history. The general approach will be to examine the evolving Roman legal system in terms of its most important features and characteristics. This will occur in the context of studying Rome’s extraordinary historical development from a tiny settlement on the banks of an obscure Italian river, to the largest empire of the pre-modern world, with a territory more extensive than that of the modern European Union. The roots of the Romans’ evident talent for law will also be explored.",

      "description": "This course is about the makeup and breakdown of the law of the sea treaty regime.In September 2013, the United States, a non-signatory of the UN Convention on Law of the Sea, signed the latest in a number of maritime boundary conventions, this time with Kiribati. And in March 2014, China, a signatory of the Convention, deflected a Filipino submission to the Permanent Court of Arbitration over claims to parts of the South China Sea. These not atypical developments suggest that the modern law of the sea regime — put into place by three conferences held in 1958, 1960, and 1973-1982 — may not be as necessary, or as effective, as its proponents had once believed. Codifying the law of the sea was a hugely ambitious project, pushing at sovereignty’s last frontier before outer space. First, it aimed to absorb customary law on the territorial sea, the continental shelf, the high seas, and fishing, into a treaty regime. Second, it articulated new international law concepts such as ‘exclusive economic zone’, ‘archipelagic state’, and transit passage through international straits. And finally, it offered a range of options for dispute resolution, which, provided states did not opt out of the regime, demanded that once a decision was handed down, states were bound to abide by them. Two issues have dominated the development of the regime: international security and the exploitation of resources. The powerful maritime states have sought the right of innocent passage through territorial waters and EEZs, and pushed for rights when traversing the high seas, archipelagos and straits. At the same time, the coastal states have laid claim to expanded territorial waters, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and greater control over the resources within them. The concerns over security and resources have touched every component of the Convention, from the protection of the marine environment, to the conduct of scientific research. Some tensions have not been resolved, and the coming period may see the fraying, if not the unravelling, of the current arrangements.",

The International Geological Congress agreed in August 2016 that we had entered the Anthropocene – a new geological age where human influence has a distinct impact on most planetary systems. Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have already caused an increase in global average temperature by 0.8 degrees Celsius and a raise of sea-level by 20 centimeters, triggering slow but dramatic planetary-wide adjustments. Efforts have been made to try to mitigate the disaster. Several treaties have been adopted since 1992. Under the US-China Joint Announcement of 2014 and the Paris Agreement of 2015, the world’s greatest economic actors agreed to accelerate and increase domestic measures. Substantial investments are being made to induce a global transition to “green” economy, with China progressively taking the lead. Hong Kong is bound by several treaties ratified by China. Hong Kong’s Climate Change Strategy and Action Agenda was adopted in 2010 and is being implemented through laws and policies in multiple sectors. Responses to climate change are increasingly impacting all aspects of the law, domestically and internationally. But is this sufficient? Will we, as a civilization and as a species, survive our entry in the Anthropocene?",

This course examines the ways in which the law and the legal system have been represented in a variety of films, and also considers the ways in which films engage with legal debates and controversies. It aims to encourage reflection on the cultural lives of the law and also on a central theme in film studies. The course is organised thematically and analyses film and legal process from a variety of jurisdictions across the globe. It explores how key legal issues, procedures, and actors are represented on film and how these representations in popular culture in turn influence understandings of the law, and in certain circumstances even its development. In particular, the module will focus on the genre of documentary film because of its commitment to authenticity and investigation of reality, while giving the students the freedom to explore feature films, TV series, and podcasts.",

First is an introduction to the particular type of digital technology, how it works and what is does, or at least is supposed to do. The use of this digital technology is then considered in the practice of law. The final phase of consideration of this form of digital technology is how the law affects it, or does not, and how it affects or may affect the law. For example, one of the first topics covered will be artificial intelligence (AI). Artificial intelligence will first be defined and explained, and possible developments of artificial intelligence considered including developments in machine learning and strong AI. Then we will consider how lawyers are using artificial intelligence for eDiscovery and eDueDiligence, how they may use if to assist in legal research, how it may replace lawyers, and the future for robo-lawyers and robo-judges. Then we will consider how law affects artificial intelligence. For example, how has financial regulation developed to deal with machines making life changing decisions for humans, how has the law of torts responded to autonomous vehicles, how has criminal law and international humanitarian law responded to autonomous weapons. Finally, we will consider how the law may develop to regulate the development and use of artificial intelligence. This three-phase approach will be followed for each form of digital technology covered on the course.",

Anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, fraud prevention, social and environmentalresponsibility, product safety and personal data protection are major examples of compliance areas.

      "description": "The PRC Company Law was enacted in order to serve as a legal regime for business entities established in Mainland China in the form of companies limited by shares and joint stock companies. This was an attempt to harmonise Mainland Chinese law governing the establishment, operation, and termination of corporations. Despite this law, until today a variety of layers of different company regimes exist in Mainland China leading to a degree of complexity that causes many problems and difficulties in practice. This course will give students an advanced understanding of the historical development of the PRC company law system in its cultural, political, and socio-economic context. It analyses the differences of available company types in Mainland China as well as their practical significance. The course is divided into the following six parts: the historical development of the PRC company law system; the PRC Company Law of 1994; other company law rules; the company limited by shares; the joint stock company; and the law governing capital markets in the PRC. The course aims at analysing PRC company law from a practical point of view, by means of practice oriented in-class and take-home exercises.",

Legal rules governing international trade and investment activities on the Chinese mainland are therefore of tremendous practical importance. This course analyses in depth how the Mainland Chinese international business law system has developed since 1978 in its political, social and economic context. It focuses on related practical implications to be taken into account from the viewpoint of Chinese and foreign traders and investors. Topics covered include: the historical development of the PRC foreign trade and investment system; particularly, the impact of China’s accession to the WTO; non-investment versus investment business activities in Mainland China; the PRC foreign trade system (different forms of trading with mainland partners; the state’s (former) foreign trade monopoly; trade contract law and practice; licenses, quota requirements, quality inspection and other restrictions; shipping and payment terms; customs law; anti-dumping; contract practice); and PRC investment law (China’s international investment treaties; government control of investment activities; representative offices; investment vehicles (EJVs, CJVs and WFOEs); industry-related special rules; mergers and acquisitions; restructuring, dissolution and insolvency of FIEs; and contract practice). In-class and take-home exercises will allow students to develop their problem-solving, drafting, negotiation, and presentation skills.",

In order to achieve these objectives, we will be reading and discussing the new P.R.C. Property Law as well as the constitutional provisions affecting China’s property regime, relevant provisions and principles of other private law legislation, and laws and regulations on land administration. We will discuss reports and documents from practical experience as well as case reports, and consider institutional structures determining the way property law is applied - or not. We will also make reference to the property law of other jurisdictions such as the German one, to help us with grasping conceptual issues in Chinese property law.",

Law is not comprehensible without knowledge of the formative processes of legal traditions and their incorporation as an attribute of culture formed over time. This course combines aspects of legal history and jurisprudence, especially sociology and political science. Students will gain a critical understanding of traditional and modern scholarship in these aspects of these fields and their relevance to law in contemporary society. Topics covered include: the Confucianist and anti-legalist traditions in China; the Greek/Roman law beginnings of the Western civil and common law traditions; the subsequent development of systems of law and government in both China and the West; and an introduction to jurisprudential, sociological, and political science theories in relation to these. The course situates itself squarely within the history and culture of Hong Kong society so that students gain a broader understanding of history, culture, and law in Hong Kong’s Chinese context.",

The divergence between theory and practice will provide the springboard to encourage students to explore the nature of legal rules, the culture of criminal justice organisations, and how the socio-political context in which criminal law operates influences the treatment of various groups within the criminal process. Areas of study will include criminal statistics, police powers of arrest, search, detention and interrogation, the structure, organisation and work practices of prosecutors and defence lawyers, plea bargaining, the operation of prisons, and the effectiveness of non-custodial punishments. Course materials will draw heavily upon empirical research from around the world, and students will be encouraged to undertake assessments with an empirical component.",

      "description": "Students will explore how Common Law has been carried into many parts of the world, and learn how in the modern state, legislated and administrative rules have greatly displaced judicially crafted solutions for the majority of legal problems. After presenting the essential characteristics of Common Law, the course will examine the three major waves of legal globalization: colonization in the 19th Century, the law and development movement of the post World War II period, and the \"Washington Consensus\" of the post Cold War period. Students will learn how colonial rules interacted with native Chinese law in Hong Kong, the difficulties of transplanting rules from one culture into another, and some aspects of the second-generation review of transplanted rules currently taking place. A main focus of the course will be to examine how rules (colonial, statutory and regulatory) have interacted with judicial action. We will in particular see how in the 20th Century, statutes and rules steadily came to dominate the field, leading to a convergence both of many individual bodies of rules and of the larger systems of Common and Civil Law. In sum, two sources of change will be studied: influence between legal systems and change within legal systems in response to changing circumstances. We will conclude with an investigation of the convergence of Common Law and Civil Law based not on geography and heritage, but on the type of problems addressed by a given law, the density of information and expert commentary available, and the existence of competent rule-making bodies. The course should give students a solid grasp of how legal systems can influence each other at the international level. It will introduce students to a debate on the quality of legal systems that has clouded the work of the World Bank and other development law projects in recent years. The course should particularly assist students in understanding and evaluating the policy thinking behind the transplanting of foreign models or laws into China, Hong Kong or another jurisdiction. It should also give students some insight into the legal history of Hong Kong.",

This course considers the meaning of the terms “art”, “antiquities” and “cultural heritage” and the legal frameworks which affect them in Hong Kong and internationally. The course begins by considering the use of these terms and the distinct and overlapping laws which affect them. The course continues considering the issues affecting the ownership, transfer and protection of art, antiquities and cultural heritage in Hong Kong and the development of international measures intended to protect art, antiquities and cultural heritage. The rise of the art and antiquities market in China and the special position of Hong Kong as a market for Chinese artifacts in the legitimate global trade in art and antiques and its position in the illicit trade will also be considered. The issues of illicit trafficking of art, antiquities and cultural heritage will be considered and the use of art, antiquities and cultural heritage for money laundering and the financing of terror. The course will consider issues of repatriation of cultural property from private and public collections, for example the looting of the Summer Palace in Beijing. Recent issues involving the protection of heritage in armed conflict and the political value in protecting and/or destroying art, antiquities and cultural heritage will also be considered.",

The historical background of colonial legal systems and their current and former international legal status will also be examined. In Part II, the course will look in more detail at the specific legal standards that developed under the conditions of colonialism, e.g. those related to slavery, restricted definitions of citizenship, capacity for territorial acquisition and native title, and others. Related academic theories and detailed historical studies will also be introduced. Part III, finally, will address the various forms that “decolonisation” has taken at the domestic and international levels, and ask students to develop their own arguments regarding the best approach for legal systems transitioning towards self-determination.",

      "description": "The ‘rule of law’ is typically thought of as an unmitigated good. Examining the history of the rule of law in the colonial context complicates this picture, however, revealing that the advancement of the ‘rule of law’ has often equally involved a project of expanding control, which has not always been linked to enhancements in peoples’ rights, or even respect for basic principles of legality.This class aims to explore the tensions inherent in the confcept by examining the history and evolution of public order governance in the British Empire. The class begins by exploring the ideologies that underpinned approaches to public order governance, considering (elite) attitudes towards the masses of the people and the challenges of governance both at home and in the colonies. The next portion of the class explores ‘everyday’ forms of public order governance, including informal and state violence, the evolution of the police, and the ways in which law evolved in order to ensure wealth generation. Following these examinations, the course turns to consider more exceptional modes of public order governance, including the policing of protests, the imposition of emergency and martial law, the development of intelligence services and counterinsurgency policy. The course concludes with some reflections on the rule of law in the colonial context more broadly, as well as with an examination of some of the ongoing resonances of colonial legality in the contemporary period.",

      "description": "This course introduces basic ideas and concepts of the law governing international business transactions. It explains the advantages and disadvantages of non-investment and investment related business transactions and analyses critically how cross-border business activities have developed over the past 100 years and what this means for different concerned parties and societies. It goes on to introduce reasons for attempts to regulate cross-border business activities on the international and on the domestic level and analyses in detail the related legal regimes. On the basis of a critical discussion of different types of cross-border business activities, students will obtain a thorough understanding of the legal sources governing cross-border business activities on the domestic and on the international levels. The main part of the course is dedicated to international trade related legal issues thus exemplifying the significance of trans-national business activities. Topics to be addressed in detail are: (1) forms of doing cross-border trade; (2) conflict of (trade) laws; (3) sources of the law of international sales of goods; (4) contract practice, contract terms, INCOTERMS, and customary trade usages; (5) transport of exports; (6) financing international trade; (7) terms of payment; (8) breach of international contracts; (9) force majeure; (10) transfer of property and retention of title; (11) commercial invoices, packing, insurance issues; (12) cross-border product liability; (13) taxation of international trade activities; (14) customs law, anti dumping law and other governmental restrictions. While the course discusses topics from the viewpoint of all concerned parties, it focuses on aspects which are relevant for private business entities which engage in international trade. Therefore, skills-based training modules, such as negotiation, drafting, presentation, and problem-solving exercises are used in order to allow students to explore the relevance of related issues ‘on the job’.",

Emphasis is placed on the critical analysis of political, socio-economic, and cultural aspects of trans-national legal problems and the significance and impact of respective legal structures in light of the globalisation of the world’s legal regimes. Part II covers public international law related aspects of trans-national scenarios. It provides an advanced understanding of the historical development, the sources, and the main subjects (players) of public international law. Part III addresses trans-national problems arising in relation to and among individuals and/or private entities with a focus on private international law concepts. It also examines attempts to harmonise legal rules applied in different jurisdictions. The course provides students with substantive legal knowledge as well as enables them to develop advanced legal skills.

      "description": "The focus of this course is on the legal structure that affects globalization. For our purposes we can think of globalization as the process by which national economies become interdependent and interlinked. This course introduces students to the legal, business and policy aspects of international trade, focusing on the complex legal framework of the various WTO Agreements as well as recent bilateral and regional trade agreements. This course analyses the legal framework of the WTO by studying the regulatory legal principles of the WTO and how they operate at both the national and international level. More specifically, the course covers issues such as tariffs and tariff negotiations, quotas, most favoured nation clauses, regional trading blocs, national treatment clauses and exceptions for environmental, health and safety and other policies, anti-dumping, export subsidies, countervailing duties, international rules on patents and copyrights and other topics of contemporary importance currently being debated. The course should give participants a sound understanding of key legal issues and principles relating to international trade and a thorough knowledge and understanding of the importance of domestic and international policy issues to the world trading system. There are no prerequisites for this course and no background in economics, international relations or international law is assumed.",

The rule setting process periodically initiated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as international bodies monitoring the global financial system will be introduced. The roles of Hong Kong as BCBS member and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as FSB member will be analysed, particularly with respect to the implementation of rules and standards. While the focus of the course is on banking regulatory law, reference will be made to legal concepts facilitating international financial transactions with relevance for doing business in Hong Kong, such as for example the standards set by the London-based Loan Market Association (LMA) or Islamic finance.

It introduces the concept of taxation including basic accounting principles and analyses critically their significance for the different concerned parties. It explains different tax types by giving country specific examples. Students will gain a thorough understanding of the reasons for the attempts to establish an international tax system, why these attempts have failed, and what this means for international business activities. Common taxation principles applied in many countries in relation to direct and indirect taxes will be discussed as well as tax regimes that have been enacted on the level of international organisations. The problem of double taxation as well as the specifics of bilateral and multilateral tax treaties will be analysed in detail. In its last part, the course focuses on the question of how private business entities react or should react to specific tax regimes. Transfer pricing, tax evasion, and tax avoidance are examined critically as well as counter-measures taken on the domestic and the international level. The course focuses on practical tax issues as they are to be understood and applied by international business lawyers. It therefore incorporates many exercises, thus enabling students to identify tax-related issues that may become important in the context of international business transactions and to develop appropriate practical solutions. The course may be combined with an equivalent course offered in other departments at CUHK.",

The legal landscape of e-commerce is presented against the backdrop of current technological trends and developing commercial practices. By giving a snapshot of the e-commerce market, its major players and dominant business models, the individual topics examine the interplay between law and technology. What are the legal implications of transaction automation? How do the novel computer interfaces affect traditional consent and disclosure requirements? Can formal requirements be digitized? The course is practice-oriented and designed to give students more confidence when confronting legal problems of technological origin. It also enables students to tackle basic regulatory issues concerning online commercial activity and equips them with the tools necessary to build convincing arguments. The course also examines the intersections of electronic commerce with aspects of data protection, privacy as well as intellectual property law to present a holistic picture of the global digital economy.",

Proceeding from an international and comparative perspective, the course examines the development of the international intellectual property law system culminating in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) TRIPs agreement. TRIPs has led to an unprecedented level of uniformity of national legal regimes dealing with intellectual property, perhaps the most uniform of all legal regimes. Differences in specific jurisdictions remain. With a view to exploring these differences, attention will be directed to selected jurisdictions including the Commonwealth, the United States, and China. Students will gain a critical understanding of the law in an increasingly globalised society.

In addition, there are different systems of corporate governance functioning today with different solutions to the problems of maximisation of shareholder wealth, accountability, and investor protection. Models of good corporate governance can therefore be examined from the perspective of Continental European regimes such as the German or French models and the Anglo-American type of governance, such as found in the United Kingdom, Delaware in the United States, and Hong Kong.

      "description": "The recent development of international investment protection law is remarkable and international investment law is emerging as a distinct and important field of international law. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of bilateral investment treaties (European Union-China, U.S.-China…) and other agreements with investment related provisions (Transpacific Partnership, Trilateral Treaty…). Foreign investments play a pivotal role in most countries’ political economies. The benefits of inward investments include, amongst others, the following: developing a sound economic structure; increasing and diversifying manufacturing; offering novel and more developed services; creating employment; and bringing innovative technology. Conversely, outward investment can bring long-term capital gains to the home country, help to build economic and political ties with other nations, and, in some cases, to ensure access to critical natural resources. In order to encourage cross-border capital flows, countries have taken various steps such as revising their domestic legal frameworks to liberalise rules on inward and outward investment and to create special regimes which provide incentives and protections for foreign investment. Alongside the developments in domestic laws, countries have also taken bilateral and multilateral action including entering into trade and/or investment agreements. In spite of political and ideological disparities, by the end of the twentieth century an international regime of foreign investment had emerged. Since the conclusion of the first bilateral investment treaty (BIT) in 1959, international investment agreements (IIAs) have significantly increased both in number and importance. As of Ausgust 1, 2016, there are over 3,200 IIAs (including treaties concluded by the HK Government which are different from the PRC treaties). The primary purpose of these proliferating norms is to ‘provide stability and security for foreign investors by limiting the range of legitimate government interventions in their affairs and by providing compensation should these norms be violated’. In exchange for these commitments, states would receive investment inflows and the benefits of the alleged consequent economic development. Recent years have witnessed the rapidly evolving dynamics of foreign investment and trade in Asia as investment into and within the region grows rapidly. Countries such as the People’s Republic of China (China), India, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea are now increasingly investing abroad; at the same time, many developing countries in the region are looking to leverage foreign investment for economic growth. These trends raise new policy questions for the home and host countries which are seeking to maximise the benefits of such outward and inward investment, while also mitigating the potential social and environmental costs.This course aims to introduce the students to the public international law standards for the treatment of foreign investments. Students will gain a thorough understanding of the theory and practice of international investment law, through lectures, case study, in-class discussions and group presentations. This course will examine the substantive law governing international investment and the growing role of investment law in the international legal system.",

      "description": "Ensuring secure and reliable energy supply in a climate-friendly and socially responsible way is one of the most important challenges that most states over the world are facing today. The law – both at the international and national levels – has a crucial role to play in achieving these energy policy objectives. Creating an appropriate regulatory environment for energy trade and investment is a highly complex exercise – but the success of this task is essential in determining the ability of states to fuel economic development, ensure social welfare and protect the environment. On the one hand, governments require a certain level of regulatory flexibility to react to rapid developments on the global energy markets. On the other hand, investors in the capital-intensive and long-term energy sector require stability and predictability of the “rules of the game” governing their economic activities.This course examines the regulation of the energy sector from an international and comparative law perspective. It presents the key concepts of energy law in the light of the policy challenges characterizing the energy landscape of the 21st Century. The focus is on the law of energy security, energy investments and energy trade – with a specific interest for the liberalization of energy markets (i.e. opening of energy markets to competition) and the de-carbonization of energy supply (i.e. the re-orientation of the energy system towards climate-friendly patterns). The objective of this course is to equip students with the necessary tools to critically engage with the complex – but highly important – legal questions relating to the organization of energy supply.",

      "description": "Mergers are the largest commercial transactions, and merger control is a fundamental part of competition law which regularly affects businesses in Hong Kong. Mergers between companies are frequent in the business world, and more than 100 countries around the world have merger control laws that must be observed. Globalization inevitably implies that merger operations can bear effects on the conditions of competition in multiple jurisdictions, and therefore companies will have to ensure that their operations comply with the laws of every jurisdiction that comes into play. The large transactions are often subject to scrutiny by several regimes simultaneously. As a consequence, companies need to be aware of the implications of the principal merger control regimes to avoid delays and uncertainty. Firms in Hong Kong whose operations might affect other markets regularly seek legal advice on merger control rules in jurisdictions such as the US, the EU and Mainland China.This course aims to provide students with a solid theoretical and practical understanding of the principal merger control regimes that affect companies in Hong Kong. On December 14, 2015, Hong Kong’s very own merger regime entered into force. For the time being, it only affects the telecommunications sector.

Since December 14, 2015, Hong Kong has a fully operational cross-sector competition law. This course will examine the most important challenges competition law enforcers in this jurisdiction currently have to address, and will look at the experience of other regimes in order to discuss how best to tackle these pressing issues.

      "description": "In practice, IIAs entail conflicts of interest between the investor and the host state over the nature of the control that could be exercised over the foreign investment. Essentially, the investor’s interest is to control its investment within a stable and predictable legal regime, while the host state seeks to exert its sovereign power to define its policies. Investor–state arbitration is deemed to be a crucial feature of foreign investment protection because it provides access to a neutral forum for the settlement of disputes. Investor–state arbitration is not only an alternative to the domestic courts of the host state, but also a technique that ‘depoliticises’ the disputes, by removing them from the intergovernmental political relationship between the home state and the host state. The course on “Investor-State Dispute Settlement” would be more than a course on arbitration. In fact, it is designed as a specialized course which pays attention to the great specifity of Investor-State Dispute Settlement.",

It is a course about investor claims against sovereign host states – i.e. investor-state disputes (or “ISDS”) – often but not always involving public, treaty rights. Often, such arbitration involves contractual and other rights such as those granted under host State legislation. In contrast, international commercial arbitration deals with the resolution of disputes over purely private law rights between what are, typically although certainly not always, private parties.The course is intended to provide an overview of the practice of investment arbitration based upon the development of substantive law, procedural principles and the growth of practice in the field. It is aimed at graduate students who may wish to develop a serious interest in arbitration, as well as those who though not necessarily wishing to pursue the subject in greater detail would like to have an understanding of it so as to complement their knowledge of international law, transnational law, international disputes practice or energy transactions.The course will be taught from the viewpoint of a commercial practitioner who worked as a former government treaty advisor and UN international lawyer.",

Law and Economics and Legal Sociology studies have demonstrated that the practice of international dispute settlement is shaped by non-legal factors, such as financial incentives and social factors. These approaches offer a valuable lens into the development of the international legal community and the interactions among its members. Drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives, this course explores the role of international legal professionals in contemporary International Economic Law and discusses a number of select issues that have arisen in recent practice which pose significant challenges to the future of the field.",

The principal focus is on the regulatory challenges raised by platform ecosystems. Digital platforms reach virtually every aspect of our lives, and their ‘gatekeeping’ allows businesses and their prospective customers to connect. Their business model has created new markets and reshaped Internet governance, with the potential to boost consumer choice and job creation. At the same time, the power amassed by gatekeepers allows them to shape the conduct of consumers, affect competitors, and control the content we access online, raising significant legal concerns. All of this needs to be analyzed against the backdrop of a fierce US-China tech war that is leaving an imprint on the legal framework.The course will cover key issues like platform governance, liability for online intermediaries, online data protection and content moderation, the role of competition law in controlling the power of digital gatekeepers, the regulation of platform workers, and conflicts of law arising over cross-border data governance or taxation matters. It is designed for anyone interested in the role of platforms in global digital trade and the evolving laws affecting the digital economy.",

      "description": "Hong Kong has been one of the world’s leading centers of project finance activity for decades. Its leadership position is the product of its prominence as a world financial center, its proximity to rapidly growing economies, its legal system and its appeal to the mix of investors, developers, bankers, lawyers and other technical, insurance and environmental consultants who are needed to identify, secure, structure, document and finance complex infrastructure projects.Hong Kong’s domestic growth has been fueled in part by the development of its port terminals, rail network, toll roads, tunnels and bridges. However, many of the projects that originate in Hong Kong are completed outside of Hong Kong and involve cross-border flows of expertise and capital. Thus, in order to get a more authentic view of the practice in Hong Kong, we will study project finance from a cross-border perspective.Our focus will be the energy sector and the main case we will study throughout the course will involve the cross-border development and project financing of an electric power plant. Where appropriate, we will also consider how other types of projects within the energy sector differ from our case study to broaden our understanding of how project finance is used in practice.",

      "description": "To address the challenge of climate change, it is necessary to urgently reorganize energy systems that are currently responsible for a significant share of greenhouse gas emissions as fossil fuels continue to dominate electricity production and heating. Renewable energy technologies are playing an increasingly important role in electricity production, and by 2050 are expected to generate most electricity produced as states implement the carbon neutrality (net-zero) targets announced as part of their contribution to international climate change mitigation efforts. The replacement of fossil energies with renewable energies requires a solid legal framework to incentivize the development of new technologies and deploy these new technologies in the energy systems. The course examines the legal arrangements that states have adopted to achieve this dual innovation and decarbonization objective. An comparative approach is taken, looking at the EU experience (a choice justified based on the EU leadership in the field of decarbonization), China (the leading manufacturer of clean technology) and the US. The clean technologies that are needed to decarbonize energy systems are of increasing importance for global trade and investment flows, with states intensifying their efforts to replace fossil energies. The course studies the crossborder trade and investment disputes that have taken place in the clean technology sector, in view of understanding how international economic law applies to this new industry.",

      "description": "This course will focus on the means by which the state controls exploitation of its oil and gas reserves. The specific characteristics of the oil and gas business (exploration, exploitation, transportation and sale) call for specific regulatory and contractual approaches. Following an introduction into the ownership of oil and gas resources and rights, the course examines how states license activities in this sector and how oil and gas rights are transferred between the main stakeholders. Besides exploration and exploitation of oil and gas, states regulate the infrastructure necessary to transport these resources to the market. This course examines how companies can obtain access to existing oil and gas pipelines, and how companies can develop new pipeline infrastructure. Taking into account the commercial interests at stake and the very high technical and political risks in the sector, energy activities are governed by a complex system of contractual arrangements. This course examines the main agreements between energy companies and states, and the agreements that regulate the interaction between energy companies. Oil and gas activities can have a significant impact on the environment. This course examines principles of health and safety regulation, as well as the question of decommissioning of oil and gas installations (with a focus on offshore installations) and the regulation of unconventional oil and gas production. The development of shale gas has transformed energy markets, but has also been criticized for its environmental impact. This course examines the environmental regulations that apply to these relatively new forms of energy production.",

      "description": "The rapid increase in the number of arbitral awards and trade-related decisions concerning the energy industry has highlighted the crucial importance of investment, trade and commercial law for the energy industry – and thus for energy lawyers. Vice versa, energy is a sector of key relevance for practicing lawyers in the field of commercial, trade and investment dispute resolution. Achieving energy security in a climate-friendly way requires massive investments in the development and decarbonization of the energy infrastructure. Besides investment flows, energy security and decarbonization have a significant impact on global trade. However, cross-border energy investment and trade flows face regulatory obstacles that can negatively impact on the ability of states to ensure the dual energy-related objectives of security of supply and climate change mitigation. On the one hand, energy investments are capital intensive and characterized with a long-term payback period. Investors therefore require strong guarantees that states and their contractual counterparts will respect the “rules of the game” that constitute the basis of their investments. On the other hand, because of the strategic and social importance of the energy industry (including green energy), states are tempted to interfere with foreign energy investments and introduce protectionist measures to promote the domestic manufacturing industry. This course examines how tribunals/panels balance investor protection and free trade with the regulation by state of security and environmental protection in the strategic energy industry.The course is divided in three parts: investment arbitration, commercial arbitration and the resolution of trade disputes.",

Both the natural environment (e.g. earthquakes, typhoons and floods) and human activities (e.g. industrial accidents and oil spills) present material risks for energy industries and in recent times energy undertakings have suffered from and contributed to environmental catastrophes. There are a number of domestic and international legal models and regulatory schemes focused on disaster risk reduction, in particular for risks posed by human activities (e.g. the Seveso Directives in the EU). Less well-developed is the law on natural disaster risk reduction. What can comparative and international environmental law contribute here, at a time when: (i) climate change will almost certainly increase the risks posed by the natural environment; and (ii) the energy industries are operating in more remote and environmentally pristine (e.g the Arctic) regions? The course will consider the different legal instruments and traditions for regulating disaster risk and the particular impact which this has on the energy sector. In addition, the course will discuss the contribution which environmental law makes to disaster risk reduction and what are the optimal legal standards for disaster prevention and risk reduction. Finally, the course will consider the law’s various responses to disasters and how, in the field of energy, the costs of risk reduction and disaster remediation are allocated between the public and private sectors and between the developed and developing world.",

Securities include shares of stock, debt instruments and derivative products. One important type of derivative product is a futures contract based on commodities, which can potentially include fossil fuels and energy contracts. Securities markets concentrate the contracting of orders to trade in securities and facilitate the transfer of both assets traded and the funds paid for such assets. Exchanges designed for such trading attempt to lower counterparty, operational and delivery risk, as well as the Alpha risk associated with issuers.Because securities markets are infrastructure designed to allow contracting and property transfer while achieving regulatory goals, they are a primary point of intersection between law, market forces, and technology (recently called 'fintech'). This course will examine the growth of securities markets in Hong Kong against the theoretical backdrop of market structure and quality, addressing recent important topics like high frequency trading, dark pools, distributed ledger technology ('blockchain') and the dramatic growth of available derivatives products and their trading on the markets. Special attention will be given to development of markets in fossil fuels and energy contracts.",

The energy industry is one of the largest sectors in China and China’s electric power industry alone spends approximately USD $116 billion per year on new investments, including generation (both conventional and clean energy types), transmission and distribution facilities. The regulation of the energy industry in China is complex and enforced by a variety of governmental agencies. Adequate, reliable and sustainable supplies of energy are crucial to China’s economy and their assurance demands continuous development and improvement of the relevant laws and regulatory systems. Chinese energy law is continually evolving to respond to national development priorities and international law development, such as sector reform and liberalisation, and regulatory concerns over environmental impact and greenhouse gas emissions. The area of energy law in China is of increasing importance for both legal practitioners and relevant stakeholders in the public sector and in the industry.This course will provide an introduction to energy law and regulation in China with a focus on the governance and regulatory systems that underlie each type of energy supply, such electricity, coal, oil and gas. Attention will be devoted to the green economic transition and its associated legal and regulatory systems in China, including renewable energy law, energy efficiency regulation and energy conservation law. The regulatory issues surrounding China’s outbound energy investment and some emerging regulatory issues in China’s energy sector, such as shale gas, electric vehicles and third party access to the pipelines, will also be addressed. The objective of this course is to develop students’ knowledge and understanding of Chinese energy law and regulation so that they are trained to apply the knowledge tools to practice, such as advising clients in power purchase agreement and assisting their low carbon investments.",

The emphasis will be on current legal and policy debates, although we will also examine the history of water development and politics. The course will focus on international water law, but will also touch upon regional and domestic law and policy on water governance in the discussion of the themes and issues. Insights are drawn from water regimes throughout the world. Water issues considered are: how to allocate water during periods of scarcity (particularly as climate change leads to more extremes); alternative means of responding to the world’s growing demands for water (including active conservation, water treatment and recycling); the appropriate role for the market and private companies in meeting society’s water needs; protection of threatened groundwater resources; environmental limits on water development (including the UN Biodiversity Convention; The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat); constitutional issues in water governance; the human right to water; indigenous water rights; protection of water quality; challenges to the substantive reform of existing water law; and inter-state and international disputes over water. Students will be expected to participate actively in classroom discussions.This course equips students with understanding, knowledge and skills of water law principles, issues, dilemmas and challenges of water managers to participate in a game of water conflict, negotiation and diplomacy. This will enhance students’ understanding of water law in practice, and all themes will be discussed with reference to implications for China.",

      "description": "This course provides students an overview of the development of law in world history. It considers major moments in the distant past as well as the recent history of law from around the world. It will also explore various manners in which different areas of law have evolved and developed, as well as the manner in which recent centuries have seen increasing dissemination, imposition, imitation, importation, and convergence between legal systems globally. Among other topics, the course will explore the place of law in ancient societies, law and religion, the ideas of natural law and legal positivism, law as a medium of commercial exchange between polities, law and property, law and the state, legal pluralism, and the manners in which law evolved in the nineteenth century in general and in the context of empire in particular. It will reflect on the different functions law can play and does play in society, the various manners in which legal orders have evolved over time, both substantively and institutionally, and the underlying factors that have driven the evolution of law and legal systems over time. The course will also provide students with an introduction to the basics of legal history methodology.",

      "description": "This course deals with the main rules and principles regulating torts in Hong Kong. By incorporating a more extended range of mandatory readings than undergraduate courses of similar length and a more research-focused assessment regime, this course is designed specifically for students at the postgraduate level who have not previously studied the law of tort as it applies in a common law jurisdiction. Torts are legally enforceable civil obligations that do not depend on any prior agreement between the parties. They are among the most frequently encountered legal issues in daily life. As with the law regulating contracts, the law regulating torts is a principal foundation of the common law. Throughout the course students will be expected to evaluate and discuss the part played by torts in maintaining and promoting (i) social and economic order, and (ii) responsible and respectful conduct, based on the community’s own customs, traditions, and expectations. Students will also be further introduced to the common law’s methods, techniques, and core values while developing their problem-solving, research, writing, and information literacy skills to a level appropriate for postgraduate studies. Topics covered include: the scope of tort law and general principles of liability; negligence (standard of care, duty of care including pure economic loss and nervous shock, causation and remoteness, defences, contributory negligence); assessment of damages for personal injuries; employers’ liability for injuries to employees; vicarious liability; strict liability and the rule in Rylands v Fletcher; occupiers’ liability; defamation; breach of statutory duty; nuisance; trespass (to persons, to land, to goods); detinue; conversion; defences to intentional torts; and remedies for intentional torts.",

After their first year, they will have already done much research and thought about the general components of their thesis. Their second year will be a spring-board for writing in their 3rd (and in some cases, 4th) years. Students will be expected to complete a series of short writing assignments focusing on academic writing (and in some cases, related to their Master’s/doctoral research) with a view to having them develop a range of tools to help them during drafting of the thesis. Through interactive workshops and small group discussion, students will be expected to engage constructively in critique and feedback on their own and colleagues’ work. In addition to developing writing skills and discovering their individual academic voice, students will develop a sense of different academic writing conventions and will be able to distinguish between and draft the thesis and academic articles (which, to the extent it does not interfere with their thesis research and writing, they may wish to write during their years as Master’s/doctoral students).",
