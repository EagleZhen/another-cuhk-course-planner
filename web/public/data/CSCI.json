Various commonly used abstract data types including vector, list, stack, queue, tree, and set and their implementations using different data structures (array, pointer based structures, linked list, 2-3 tree, B-tree, etc.) will be discussed.

Computer vision is the enterprise of building machines that can sense and extract information from 3D scenes. It is one of the fastest growing and exciting disciplines in today’s academia and industry, with a wide variety of applications in robotics, video surveillance, navigation, consumer electronics, human-computer interaction, medical imaging, remote sensing, space exploration, and so on. This course is designed to open the doors for students who are interested in learning about the fundamental principles and important applications of computer vision. The following topics will be covered: cameras and image formation, image filtering, edge and corner detection, image features and matching, image alignment, geometric camera models, binocular stereo, optical flow, radiometry, photometric stereo, structured light, and other applications in machine vision. We will expose students to a number of real-world applications that are important to our daily lives. Students will learn core concepts of computer vision, as well as hands-on experience to solve real world problems with computer vision.",

      "description": "This course aims to introduce fundamental concepts and technologies in computer networking. The course adopts a top-down approach introducing the TCP/IP networking stack. The design of the contemporary communication applications will be studied. The fundamental concepts in implementing the reliable transport protocols, such as TCP, will be taught in this course. Design issues of TCP, such as the sliding window protocol and the congestion control, will also be included. This course will also focus on the IP network and the routing algorithms used in the Internet. Last, the design issues in the data link layer (e.g., Ethernet), including the medium access control, will be introduced.",

This course gives an overview of modern deep learning techniques for natural language processing. The course starts with basic linguistic concepts in NLP and moves from shallow bag-of-words representations to richer structural embeddings, which is the foundation for the successful use of deep learning in NLP. Then the course will guide you through three fundamental tasks of NLP: language modeling (LM), natural language understanding (NLU), and natural language generation (NLG), followed by some recent advances such as BERT and adversarial learning. Along the way we will introduce cutting-edge computational models together with insights from a linguistic perspective.Advisory: Students are expected to have the background of deep learning, machine learning, linear algebra, programming , and data structure.",
