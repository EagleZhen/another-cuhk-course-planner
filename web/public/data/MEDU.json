      "description": "Digital health is a broad overarching term encompassing digital tools, technologies and services that connect and empower people and populations to manage health and wellness. Digital health varies from relatively established areas such as communication between a patient and a doctor through telemedicine to newly emerging areas such as the use of computer science in big data and artificial intelligence to enhance the accuracy of the diagnostic processes or predicting patient outcomes. In the recent years, digital health became an inevitable part of healthcare providing personalized healthcare.\nThis course will introduce undergraduate students to the landscape of digital health technology and the application of digital health data. Digital devices can be helpful for individuals to monitor their health through wearable devices, mobile application monitoring and home systems. These devices can have benefits to patient care and improve health. This course will provide students with the basic architecture of digital health from digital devices and data platforms, computing and data science and artificial intelligence. Students will also acquire experience of digital innovation from user and stakeholder engagement.\nStudents will start with an overview of digital health and then discuss research articles on social media data for disease management, new forms of health data from wearable devices and mobile APPs, and discussion on the big data and the application of artificial intelligence. Students will be divided into different teams to prepare a pitching presentation after they attend lessons from case studies and stakeholder sharing. Feedbacks and comments will be given by a team of judgement panel in the final presentation. Finally, they will be able to describe the basic components of digital health and understand the application of digital health technology through experiential learning in a pitching presentation.",

      "description": "Medical schools strive to educate knowledgeable, caring and professional physicians. The growing interest in empathy, wellness and resilience has fuelled the design and implementation of structured educational programmes worldwide to cultivate empathy, especially when there is a globally increasing trend in professional burnout among undergraduates and resident trainees. Empathy in the medical setting includes appreciating the patient's emotions and the expression of that awareness. Empathy is an essential learning objective that can be cultivated. Empathy brings about patient satisfaction, promotes adherence to medical recommendations and good clinical outcomes, and more importantly, professional satisfaction. A key component of empathy is reflective capacity. Fostering reflective capacity within medical education helps develop critical thinking skills, inform clinical reasoning, and enhance professionalism among trainees. The development of reflective capacity is conducive to effective feedback in medical education and is an essential aspect of self-regulated and lifelong learning. Failure to reflect on one's thinking processes, including a critical examination of one's assumptions, beliefs, and conclusions, was recently described as a cognitive component of \"physician overconfidence,\" a contributing cause of diagnostic error in medicine. Reflection is not necessarily intuitive, especially in students at the initial stages of their medical careers. The over-arching aim of the course is to nurture and consolidate the key soft skills of an effective doctor and a healthy resilient personality through the development of reflective capacity and empathy.\n\nThe course is delivered in progressive stages to build reflective capacity and empathy in specific professional developmental contexts. The four building blocks, as outlined below, will be emphasized in different years. The building blocks will be progressively built and integrated over the curriculum from years 2 to 4.\n1. Empathic Engagement (Year 2)\n2. Doctor and Society (Year 3)\n3. Doctor and Self- Reflection in Practice (Year 4)\n4. Doctor and Profession (Year 4)\nThe four components encompass the core values of a healthy and competent doctor who can foster a therapeutic alliance with patients, appreciate and reflect the meaning of work, be a team player, and connect with the public and society.\n\nAttendance to the empathic engagement workshop is mandatory.",

Empathic Engagement (Year 2)\n2. Doctor and Society (Year 3)\n3. Doctor and Self- Reflection in Practice (Year 4)\n4. Doctor and Profession (Year 4)\n\nThe four components encompass the core values of a healthy and competent doctor who can foster a therapeutic alliance with patients, appreciate and reflect the meaning of work, be a team player, and connect with the public and society.\n\nThrough a narrative medicine approach, Year 3 medical students are expected to explore more about the community/society to establish a connection with the public and society as team players.\nThe course will cover four different themes for students to explore and reflect on more.\na.

The therapeutic relationship enables the health professional and the patient to become cooperatively engaged and thereby effect beneficial change in the patient. This therapeutic relationship may be a one-off encounter or can be lifelong. The student should already have a deep understanding of the challenges from the doctor’s perspective and the range and variety of medical conditions of patient presentation.\n\nThis course is a continuation of Doctor and Patient I and II and complements the experiences gleaned from the visits that are made in the family project during the child’s second and third year of life. The course aims to give students insights into the biological, social, psychological and medical context of care in the child's second and third year of life. This course is taught by a series of lectures and small group tutorials. There are family visits and interviews. The course ends after community and family medicine, paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology and psychiatry rotations so that the student has a comprehensive overview of the medical, developmental and social aspects to the family and child and the role of the community in health care. Case presentations in the interdisciplinary seminar discuss salient learning points in the course.",

      "description": "The primary focus of this course is the anatomy of the head and neck in the human body. First part introduces the organization of the extra-cranial structures; second part focuses on the organization of the central nervous system. The course is taught through lectures, supplemented with experiential learning in dissecting laboratory and other practical sessions. Different regions of the head and neck, including the bony components and associated organ systems are examined. The detailed blood supply and cranial nerve innervation is emphasized. This is followed by the study of the organization of the brain and spinal cord, and their control of the structures of the head and neck. Lastly, the embryonic development of the head and central nervous system including sense organs such as the eye and ear is discussed. It helps to enhance students' understanding of the overall complexity of this body region. The course also contains dedicated Clinical Anatomy sections to help student understand and contextualise anatomy of the head and neck, and appreciate their relevance in clinical practice. These includes clinically-orientated lectures and e-lectures.",

      "description": "Medical schools strive to educate knowledgeable, caring and professional physicians. The course is delivered in progressive stages to build reflective capacity and empathy in specific professional developmental contexts. The four building blocks as outlined below will be emphasized in different years. The building blocks will be progressively built and integrated over the curriculum from years 2 to 4.\n1. Empathic Engagement (Year 2)\n2. Doctor and Society (Year 3)\n3. Doctor and Self- Reflection in Practice (Year 4)\n4. Doctor and Profession (Year 4)\nThe four components encompass the core values of a healthy and competent doctor who can foster a therapeutic alliance with patients, appreciate and reflect the meaning of work, be a team player, and connect with the public and society.\n\nAfter completing the course MEDU3160 in Year 3, students are expected to build the reflective capacity on mapping their external and internal resources and develop sensitivity to connect with society as knowledgeable, caring, and professional physicians. Medical students are also expected to explore self and teamwork in a clinical environment with a good sense of professionalism.\n\nA clinical medical setting is a teamwork environment with multidisciplinary professionals, e.g., doctors, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, who must work together, communicate frequently, and have a common goal to care for the patients. The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends medical students learn the principles of teamwork in their training.\n\nMoreover, nowadays, the work duty of a doctor is heavily loaded, physically and emotionally. The development of regular self-reflection in practice would help the students enhance resilience in managing stress. In this course, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) will be used to help the students reflect on how their values, needs, and personality traits greatly influence the helping process and style.\n\nApart from MBTI, Mindfulness is recognized by the leading Medical Schools worldwide as a beneficial practice for their students and residents. Mindfulness is cultivated to promote self-care, self-awareness, and empathy with the ultimate aim of mutually improving the well–being of doctors-in-training and for the long-term patient care with good quality.\n\nThe course covers three different themes for students to explore and reflect on. It includes:\na. being an effective team player; b. understanding personality type and professional Care Style through Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI); and\nc. Mindfulness and Cognitive techniques for medical students.",

The student also continues to engage with the family as the child is reaching one year old and interact and observe family dynamic, child development, health beliefs and social, medical and community support.\n\nThe course has two components:\nPart I: Doctor-patient relationship in the community\nThis is a continuation of the clinical visits with a doctor. During these visits, the attention is now drawn to the patient’s perspective and narrative in looking and listening closely to the words, tones, gestures and actions used in the patient’s experience of illness, the communication and the interaction and exchange between the doctor and the patient. Meanwhile, issues relating to caring for those in decline and dying are discussed.\n\nPart II: Child and family development in the community\nThis is the continuation of the family follow up project in which the students observe, interact and gain insight into the biological, social, psychological and medical context of care in the child's first year of life.\n\nThis course is taught by a series of lectures and small group tutorials.

      "description": "This course provides 9 weeks of integrated teaching in Community and Family Medicine.\n\nIn Community Medicine, three major areas are covered: Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Public Health Medicine, and Occupation and Environmental Medicine. The principles and practice of public health, the application of epidemiological study methods, and the prevention and control of communicable, non-communicable and occupational diseases are introduced to students. In addition to lectures, clinical attachments, interactive/practical sessions, field visits, group work, and presentations in seminars and tutorials are utilised to facilitate learning.\n\nThe clinical clerkship in Family Medicine teaches practical family medicine skills and equips students with the understanding and ability to diagnose and manage common medical conditions that present in primary care settings. Throughout the clerkship, students are taught skills in making differential diagnoses of presenting symptoms, prioritisation of multiple medical conditions and investigations and management of common medical problems in the community. Students also gain exposure to the basic principles and practice of family medicine, i.e., providing primary, comprehensive, holistic and continuing person centred care. The clinical clerkship consists of online teaching and case based seminars, clinical team based learning workshops, clinical attachments to private family medicine doctors, Hospital Authority clinics and community health centres and health care providers for vulnerable populations. To facilitate learning, role playing in workshops and clinical enhanced skills training are provided. Facilities utilised for this clinical teaching include the University Family Medicine Clinics, and Family Medicine clinics run by Hospital Authority and private practitioners, both in public and private settings throughout Hong Kong.",

Medical professionalism is primarily concerned with the attributes and behaviours of physicians in the practice of Medicine. The teaching of medical professionalism builds on introductory lectures provided in prior years and informal \"role modeling\" that occurs during the clinical curriculum. The module is designed to expand the students' cognitive base for professionalism, and to provide opportunities for internalizing related values and behaviours by collaborating in small group problem solving sessions. The workshops require analysis and development of moral solutions for simulated ethical dilemmas. Feedback provided by small groups to their whole class enables reflection and informed discussions.",

Use competently the clinical method to identify and plan to resolve clinical problems through:\n• reliable, relevant and sensitive history taking, relating effectively to parents and children;\n• thorough, accurate and gentle physical examination;\n• concise evaluation of the presenting clinical problem;\n• orderly planning of any further diagnostic procedures which might be indicated to establish a diagnosis;\n• appreciation of the PRINCIPLES of treatment (including the roles of other health professionals, e.g., speech therapists, physiotherapists, social workers, clinical psychologists in management);\n• understanding the principles underlying FOLLOW-UP assessment in order to appreciate the natural or assisted course of a clinical problem;\n• awareness of the psycho-social consequences (the impact of illness on behaviour, education, family life) of illness and its simple medico-legal consequences; and\n• appreciation of a broad, holistic and sensitive outlook towards the total health of individuals and communities.\n4. Demonstrate skill in communicating with a child, parents and fellow professional workers, including traits of empathy, patience, kindness and counselling ability.\n5. Provide at the bedside an orderly presentation of a clinical problem.\n6.

Through small group teachings, students will be able to discuss challenges and forumulate possible solutions.\n\nMain objective: To teach medical students the potential medico-legal pitfalls and the ethical dilemmas in daily family practice as family physicians will be asked to undertake various tasks not within the boundary of conventional healthcare setting.\n\nSpecific objective: To teach Year 5 medical students of The Chinese University of Hong Kong the potential medico-legal pitfalls in daily family practice and the ethical dilemmas in daily practice. It will build on the teaching in year 4.\n\nStudents must read the note and refresh what they have learnt from Bioethics course especially in Year 4 before coming to class for meaningful interactive discussion.\n\nIn the Obstetrics and Gynaecology module, students will learn about ethical issues through the interactive student forum and seminar, such as termination of pregnancy, reproductive autonomy in the face to emerging technologies, as well as obstetricians' role in the decision-making between pregnant women and the potential human — fetus.\n\nIn the Paediatrics module, students will learn about bioethical considerations that paediatricians face while treating children for health conditions. For children, unlike for adult patients, healthcare decisions are often made by someone other than the person to be treated, i.e. by the parents/primary carers. Issues of patient confidentiality, consent for treatment, and child protection require the treating doctor to be aware of the specific needs and desires of the child, and to be able to respect and adequately address situations when the child's and parents' views and needs diverge.\n\nIn the Psychiatry module, students will learn about common and unique bioethical considerations that psychiatry faces while treating patients with mental health conditions, such as patient confidentiality, consent for treatment in psychiatric illness, and capacity determination.\n\nIn addition, students are required to attend the annual Lanson Lecture hosted by the CUHK Centre for Bioethics.",

Alongside the essential medical knowledge required for everyday care, students must also learn to navigate the complex and multifaceted landscape of healthcare relationships among all stakeholders and the ethical challenges that arise within it.\n\nParallel to clinical teaching, the MED6 Clinical Ethics II course will enable students to apply the moral reasoning principles in healthcare delivery. The curricular design leverages clinical experiences to promote ethical decision-making and the resolution of dilemmas. In doing so, students will develop tangible critical thinking skills to prevent and resolve doctor-patient conflicts, which is a crucial step in the transition to becoming medical professionals. Students are expected to identify the ethical issues, resolve the dilemmas through an ethical reasoning process, and implement their decisions through communication with patients or their surrogates.",

      "description": "The Senior Medical Clerkship consists of two ten-week modules, referred to as Medicine A and Medicine B. Medicine A consists of attachments to the medical wards in Princess Margaret Hospital, North District Hospital, Shatin Hospital, Our Lady of Maryknoll Hospital, and Prince of Wales Hospital as well as Clinical Skills Lab and one week of Assistant Intern (AI) Programme shadowing Medical Officers at the Prince of Wales Hospital. Students are attached to each of the above hospitals/unit in rotation. Medicine B involves attachments to medical wards under the supervision of the Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Department of Clinical Oncology, and Accident and Emergency Medicine Academic Unit as well as a one week of AI Programme shadowing Interns in the Prince of Wales Hospital. Students are attached to each of the above Departments in rotation in order to learn by daily clinical contact with patients in the respective wards. Students are encouraged to clerk patients and present during subspecialty rounds, and to follow patients’ progress during their hospital stay. Subspecialty teaching sessions are also held every Wednesday throughout the two modules. Students are attached to subspecialty activities and outpatient clinics during their respective rotations. Bedside teaching of clinical skills is arranged in small groups twice weekly. All students in these medical rotations are expected to attend medical grand rounds every Wednesday.\n\nA total of two-week AI Programme shadowing with one-week AI Programme shadowing Medical Officers is integrated into Medicine A module while a one-week AI Programme shadowing Interns is integrated into Medicine B module. Students shadow the frontline doctors to learn and experience daily clinical work with both inpatients and outpatients. Requiring active participation in clinical activities under close supervision by the frontline doctors, the programme is designed to help students develop core competencies as medical professionals. The AI Programme aims to nurture self-initiative, sense of responsibility, stress coping strategies, communication skills and social responsibility through experiential learning in actual clinical settings.\n\nSmall group tutorials during both clerkships as well as during AI are provided in order to further develop students' communication skills within clinical and professional settings. This includes presenting in medical rounds, writing patients' scripts and referrals, having communications with lay public concerning medical matters, handling complaints and bad news, organizing and presenting literature or decision making in clinical conferences. These skills are assessed formally in the end-of-module examinations and are also an obligatory component of final year graduating examinations. Multidisciplinary integrative sessions are maintained throughout this course.",
