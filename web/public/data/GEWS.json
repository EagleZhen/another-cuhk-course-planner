      "description": "Napoleon Bonaparte once said of China: “China is a sleeping lion. Let her sleep, for when she wakes she will move the world.” Today, China has risen to become the second largest global economic power; and some experts even predicted that her economy is poised to overtake the US economy by year-2035. Is Napoleon’s prophecy going to come true? China has remained an enigma to the rest of the world. Traditional China’s accomplishments towards medicine, painting, architecture, martial art music and dance had impressed the world and her inventions such as paper, gunpowder, compass, and printing had helped move Europe to the modern age. This course aims to examine the evolvement of the Chinese civilization and factors affecting how China interacts with the rest of the world. It will also explore the extent and impacts of intercultural exchanges between China and the world. The course will also look at the role Hong Kong played in China’s interaction with foreign powers in the past and assess opportunities afforded Hong Kong in the implementation of the Chinese “One Belt, one Road” initiative.In conclusion, the course will assess the swift rise of contemporary China, and the aftermaths brought by her rapid industrialization. The course will try to answer if China will fulfil Napoleon’s prophecy.",

      "description": "This course covers a wide variety of material and is highly relevant in understanding rapid changes in Global and Comparative European Politics. Part I of the course provides a brief historical background to European politics and sets the scene for the course, in examining theoretically how contemporary ‘populism’ is defined and conceptualized in the 21st century political landscape. Part II of the course provides the main focus of the course, in focusing on the main causes and drivers that have led to the growth of (a) radical right-wing populism and (b) radical left-wing populism. Three key approaches are drawn on in Part II of the course, with comparative studies, survey research (public opinion) and case studies across Western Europe and Central-Eastern Europe allowing students to understand about the diversity and variations of populism in the contemporary political landscape. Part III of the course introduces students to critical debates and evaluations on the ‘rise’ of populism and just how important understanding this political phenomenon is for (a) the implications for contemporary democracy and governance in EU member states, alongside (b) how populism on the ‘right’ and ‘left’ of the political spectrum is challenging the future EU project. Part III of the course also draws briefly on comparisons between the primary causes of ‘populism’ in the European context, to the causes of ‘localism’ in the Hong Kong context.The final part of the course also revisits the premise and assumption made in Part I of the course, about the historical stability of the European political landscape by outlining how a shift has taken place, with ‘a new form of politics’ now existing in European politics. Stability and patterns of partisan alignment have now been replaced by instability and widespread patterns of electoral volatility.",

It helps us to speak to others without blaming and to hear personal criticisms without withering. This approach can be used in nearly any situation — from dealing with troublesome peers in schools to ironing out rough patches with parents at home.",

      "description": "Behavioral science is a cross disciplinary approach to understanding the human mind and its decision process. It is a combination of scientific research in social psychology, cognitive psychology, and economics. Behavioral science theories have been used to better understand how humans perceive, think, and make decisions. The objective of this course is to enhance your understanding of the fundamental factors that drive human behaviors. By understand these factors, you may gain better insights into analyzing your own behaviors and developing strategies for behavioral management. For example, we will teach learning theories (how certain ideas become associated with each other over time; how people learn through conditioning processes) and use these theories to explain behaviors we observe in daily lives [1] [2]. We will also discuss three major theories from the Behavioral Economics literature, including “prospect theory”, “mental accounting”, and “hyperbolic discounting / intertemporal choice”. These theories will help us understand how people value money, why human valuation of money does not simply depend on the nominal value of the money, and how people mentally track expenditures. Students who would like to read about these topics before course registration may consult the following one-page articles: [3], [4], [5] We will also introduce a simple model that guides behavioral change. We will discuss the EAST framework developed by the Behavioral Insight Team. Although the framework was originally developed for policymakers to guide their policy development, everyone can use the framework to guide their own behaviors.
