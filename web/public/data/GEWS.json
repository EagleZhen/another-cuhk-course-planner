      "description": "Napoleon Bonaparte once said of China: “China is a sleeping lion. Let her sleep, for when she wakes she will move the world.” Today, China has risen to become the second largest global economic power; and some experts even predicted that her economy is poised to overtake the US economy by year-2035. Is Napoleon’s prophecy going to come true? China has remained an enigma to the rest of the world. Traditional China’s accomplishments towards medicine, painting, architecture, martial art music and dance had impressed the world and her inventions such as paper, gunpowder, compass, and printing had helped move Europe to the modern age. This course aims to examine the evolvement of the Chinese civilization and factors affecting how China interacts with the rest of the world. It will also explore the extent and impacts of intercultural exchanges between China and the world. The course will also look at the role Hong Kong played in China’s interaction with foreign powers in the past and assess opportunities afforded Hong Kong in the implementation of the Chinese “One Belt, one Road” initiative.In conclusion, the course will assess the swift rise of contemporary China, and the aftermaths brought by her rapid industrialization. The course will try to answer if China will fulfil Napoleon’s prophecy.",

      "description": "This course aims to introduce nature’s genius in the diversity of flora and fauna of Hong Kong and other places. It is specially designed for students in their second year of study or above. The goal is to raise students' awareness of nature’s hidden beauty and genius, including biodiversity and biomimicry. Coursework includes lectures and outings led by experts in their fields, field trip reports, analysis and interpretation of wildlife films in class, feedback on video-clips, a multimedia art exercise, and a biodiversity quiz. Students will learn to appreciate and treasure biodiversity through guided tree walks, bird watching, butterfly photography, and powerful ideas of Nature as our mentor, measure and model in solving human problems. No prior knowledge of biodiversity, or training in multimedia or photography is required, but a sense of wonder, a spirit of inquiry, and passionate curiosity in Nature’s genius.",

      "description": "This course covers a wide variety of material and is highly relevant in understanding rapid changes in Global and Comparative European Politics. Part I of the course provides a brief historical background to European politics and sets the scene for the course, in examining theoretically how contemporary ‘populism’ is defined and conceptualized in the 21st century political landscape. Part II of the course provides the main focus of the course, in focusing on the main causes and drivers that have led to the growth of (a) radical right-wing populism and (b) radical left-wing populism. Three key approaches are drawn on in Part II of the course, with comparative studies, survey research (public opinion) and case studies across Western Europe and Central-Eastern Europe allowing students to understand about the diversity and variations of populism in the contemporary political landscape. Part III of the course introduces students to critical debates and evaluations on the ‘rise’ of populism and just how important understanding this political phenomenon is for (a) the implications for contemporary democracy and governance in EU member states, alongside (b) how populism on the ‘right’ and ‘left’ of the political spectrum is challenging the future EU project. Part III of the course also draws briefly on comparisons between the primary causes of ‘populism’ in the European context, to the causes of ‘localism’ in the Hong Kong context.The final part of the course also revisits the premise and assumption made in Part I of the course, about the historical stability of the European political landscape by outlining how a shift has taken place, with ‘a new form of politics’ now existing in European politics. Stability and patterns of partisan alignment have now been replaced by instability and widespread patterns of electoral volatility.",

More importantly, could Hong Kong’s successful development be sustained in a long run? This is an introductory course on contemporary Hong Kong issues.

      "description": "Behavioral science is a cross disciplinary approach to understanding the human mind and its decision process. It is a combination of scientific research in social psychology, cognitive psychology, and economics. Behavioral science theories have been used to better understand how humans perceive, think, and make decisions. The objective of this course is to enhance your understanding of the fundamental factors that drive human behaviors. By understand these factors, you may gain better insights into analyzing your own behaviors and developing strategies for behavioral management. For example, we will teach learning theories (how certain ideas become associated with each other over time; how people learn through conditioning processes) and use these theories to explain behaviors we observe in daily lives [1] [2]. We will also discuss three major theories from the Behavioral Economics literature, including “prospect theory”, “mental accounting”, and “hyperbolic discounting / intertemporal choice”. These theories will help us understand how people value money, why human valuation of money does not simply depend on the nominal value of the money, and how people mentally track expenditures. Students who would like to read about these topics before course registration may consult the following one-page articles: [3], [4], [5] We will also introduce a simple model that guides behavioral change. We will discuss the EAST framework developed by the Behavioral Insight Team. Although the framework was originally developed for policymakers to guide their policy development, everyone can use the framework to guide their own behaviors.

      "course_syllabus": "Prospect theory - Prospect theory is a Nobel-Prize-winning behavioral model that discusses how people decide between alternatives that involve risk and uncertainty (e.g. % likelihood of gains or losses). It demonstrates that people think in terms of expected\nutility\nrelative to a\nreference point\n(e.g. current wealth) rather than absolute outcomes. (\nhttps://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/prospect-theory/\n)\nMental accounting - A behavioral economics concept introduced by Nobel Prize-winning economist Richard Thaler, refers to the set of cognitive operations used by people to organize and track financial activities. Due to people’s limited mental capacity, these operations are often imperfect. Hence, these mental operations often result in biased judgment and decisions.\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mentalaccounting.asp\nHyperbolic discounting and self-control - Hyperbolic discounting is our inclination to choose immediate rewards over rewards that come later, even if the immediate rewards are actually smaller than the later rewards. The model helps us understand self-control issues from a theoretical perspective (rather than thinking of it as a will-power limitation).\nAssociative learning theories - Associative learning theories strive to capture the processes underlying and driving the change in strength of the associations between representations of stimuli that develop as a result of experience of the predictive relationships between those stimuli.\n[WMY1]\nAssociative learning is one of the ways people learn to mentally connect things (ideas, concepts) together. The associative learning theories have been broadly used in many different domains, but in this course we will focus our discussion on the role of associative learning theories in habit formation (which will hopefully shed light on how to develop strategies for changing bad habits and building good habits). We adopt the perspective that habits strengthen through associative and award-learning mechanisms that characterize a slow, incremental nature of habit formation. We discuss the theories in class, and contextualize the theories using examples drawn from daily lives.\nSystem 1 and System 2 thinking - System 1 thinking is a near-instantaneous process; it happens automatically, intuitively, and with little effort. It’s driven by instinct and our experiences. System 2 thinking is slower and requires more effort. It is conscious and logical. Daniel Kahneman suggests that 95% of our behaviors are guided by System 1. By understanding how these two systems work, we will gain better insights into understanding the factors that drive those seemingly “mindless” behaviors.\nHeuristics and Biases in Judgment and decision making - Heuristics are mental shortcuts that can facilitate problem-solving and probability judgments. These strategies are generalizations, or rules-of-thumb, reduce cognitive load, and can be effective for making immediate judgments.\nDesign of behavioural change solutions - Students, based on theories covered by this course, design and carry out a service-learning project to help members in their community (College/ family) to change their behaviours so as to promote well-being in the community.",
