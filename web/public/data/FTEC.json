      "description": "This course provides an advanced examination of financial infrastructures, which include trading venues and platforms, securities settlement systems, payment systems, cross-border transactions interlinks, central counterparties and clearance, cybersecurity, and systemic risks. It requires students to undertake project work with a view to make concrete their understanding of the underlying technologies enabling Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure. The student projects will be required to explore the implications of new financial services technology, in particular, the licensing prerequisites, regulatory controls and supervision such new services necessitate. Students will have to form groups and select a particular infrastructure area, e.g. electronic payments or lending, and conduct a deep analysis of its operations, and thereby creating new/enhanced service propositions. It is intended that project teams will be able to create prototype solutions through collaborating with, for example, the Hong Kong and Science Technology Park (HKSTP), Cyberport, ASTRI, or other CUHK labs. Upon completing this course, students should have acquired advanced understanding of components of financial infrastructure, and its significance in the financial services sector.",

To qualify for the award of the subject credits, the student must (a) attend regulatory workshop provided by such regulatory authorities as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Securities & Futures Commission, and Insurance Authority, and (b) attach to a company in a financial technology related post as approved by the Professor-in-Charge for no less than 12 weeks. The student will have an academic supervisor as assigned by the Professor-in-Charge and an industry supervisor from the company. There will be a mid-term company visit by the academic supervisor. At the end of the internship, the student must give a presentation to the academic and industry supervisors, and submit a report summarizing what the student has done and learnt from the internship. The student’s grade will be determined by (1) the presentation, (2) the student report and (3) a testimonial from the industry supervisor.The internship should normally take place in the summer term after a student has finished the first two semesters of studies. Part-time students can decide to undertake the internship in the summer term of either the first or second year of studies.Students are recommended to seek the Professor-in-Charge's comment on potential internship opportunities before enrolling in the course.",

This course will build the capabilities of students to an advanced level and will enable participants to actively engage in the full lifecycle of “bot” development from assessment of automation opportunities through the building/deployment of functional automations. The course also introduces students to the latest industry developments in low-code artificial intelligence providing students with less technical backgrounds an opportunity to learn the skills to automate business processes without a need of a computer science background.Course participants are expected to:1. Gain a clear understanding of the intelligent automation (RPA + AI) industry and benefits and understand the limits and constraints of process automation.2. Learn about the role of business analysis in the context of process automation implementation including: (a) how to conduct an automation opportunity assessment; (b) how to map the requirements and deliverables of a process automation project; (c) best practices during the Process Deep Dive stage including ways of compiling comprehensive process-related documentation; (d) testing strategies for an process automation solution; (e) how to conduct trainings and create a User Manual during Go-Live preparations; and (f) how to manage changes throughout the entire process automation development process. 3. Understand the delivery methodology of process automation project/program management including: (a) steps of a process automation implementation, (b) choosing processes suitable for automation, (c) driving/managing process automation projects, and (d) raising intelligent automation awareness throughout an organization.4.

Agentic AI systems have a high degree of autonomy and can act with minimal human supervision. Agentic AI could revolutionize business and financial technologies of the future. This course introduces the students to the fundamentals of agentic systems, covering reinforcement learning agents, language model agents, and multi-agent systems. We will cover applications of agentic systems in various aspects of business and fintech, including cryptocurrency/blockchain, financial analysis, portfolio management, customer service, human resources, business planning, and operations.",

      "description": "The courses, Financial Technology Project I & II, involve a significant research and/or development project under the supervision of an academic staff in any area of financial technology. Unless otherwise approved by the Professor-in-Charge, the project should involve an industrial partner with a co-supervisor from the industry. At the end of the course, the student must give a presentation to the academic and industry supervisors, and submit a report detailing the findings and deliverables. The student’s grade will be determined by the presentation and the report.Unless otherwise approved by the Programme Director, the credits for Financial Technology Project I are recognized if and only if the student takes also Financial Technology Project II in a subsequent semester.If a student has prior industrial background and has already secured a project topic with an industrial practitioner and the agreement of an academic staff, Financial Technology Project I can be taken in the first semester of studies. Otherwise, the two project courses can be taken in any consecutive semesters, including the summer term.Students are encouraged to find industrial projects by themselves and talk to various academic staffs for project ideas before enrolling in the courses.",

      "description": "The courses, Financial Technology Project I & II, involve a significant research and/or development project under the supervision of an academic staff in any area of financial technology. Unless otherwise approved by the Professor-in-Charge, the project should involve an industrial partner with a co-supervisor from the industry. At the end of the course, the student must give a presentation to the academic and industry supervisors, and submit a report detailing the findings and deliverables. The student’s grade will be determined by the presentation and the report.Unless otherwise approved by the Programme Director, the credits for Financial Technology Project I are recognized if and only if the student takes also Financial Technology Project II in a subsequent semester.If a student has prior industrial background and has already secured a project topic with an industrial practitioner and the agreement of an academic staff, Financial Technology Project I can be taken in the first semester of studies. Otherwise, the two project courses can be taken in any consecutive semesters, including the summer term.Students are encouraged to find industrial projects by themselves and talk to various academic staffs for project ideas before enrolling in the courses.",
