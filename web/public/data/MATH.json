After taking and passing this course, a student is expected\n- to understand the axioms of the real number system (constructions such as the Dedekind cuts are not necessary),\n- to know the basic properties of countable and uncountable sets (must know that real numbers and irrational numbers are uncountable) and the statement of the continuum hypothesis,\n- to familiarize with the concept of limits of sequences, series and functions, and\n- to know the concept of continuity and uniform continuity for functions on the real line, on higher dimensional Euclidean spaces, as well as relevant results.",

Variational models and PDE-based techniques will also be discussed.\nStudents are expected to have basic knowledge in calculus and linear algebra. Some basic programming skills, such as Matlab, C++ or other programming languages, are also expected for programming exercises. Some background in numerical analysis, Fourier analysis and partial differential equations will be helpful, although the necessary concepts will be discussed as they are used.\nAdvisory: MATH Majors should select not more than 5 MATH courses in a term.",

(Rigorous proofs of convergence of the series of solutions should also be understood.)\n\n- to learn well the solution of the Cauchy problem for the wave equations in low dimensions by the method of spherical means,\n\n- to learn well the solution of the Cauchy problem for the heat equation by the heat kernel or by Fourier transform. The characteristic properties of heat flows and wave motions should be well-understood.\n\n- to know the Poison formula for the solution of the Laplace equation on a ball and have some idea of solving the problem over a general domain by Perron’s method, and\n\n- to understand well various maximum principle as they are applied to the uniqueness issues for elliptic and parabolic equations.",
