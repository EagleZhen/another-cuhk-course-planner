The course is not theory-based, but its purpose is to expose the students to the diverse strains of cultural thought and practice that are relevant to contemporary society, particularly that of Hong Kong, China and Asia. Relevant contemporary issues will be drawn extensively to explain the values of the humanities and the need for knowledge of cultural studies in the societies of Hong Kong, China and Asia.The course covers four sections to explain the breadth of knowledge that can be applied to understand how culture works. The four sections include (1) basic introduction of cultural studies as an interdisciplinary field, (2) media representation in popular culture, (3) memory, history and modernity and (4) community, urban culture and critical pedagogy. The four sections show the trajectory of applying a cultural studies point of view to understand why culture matters in today’s fast changing world. The Chinese and English sections of the course will select from a total of 22 sub-themes to discuss the role of culture to art, technology, education and humanities.",

      "description": "This course introduces students to the basic concepts and practices of public humanities, an emerging field that examines the influence of the humanities in the public sphere. It guides students through the ways in which humanistic thinking and inquiry can impact community engagement, collective cultural history and memory, policy-making, and the cultivation of empathy. Organized into three sections—Visions, Paths, and Experiments—each part focusing on different dimensions of public humanities, the course begins by exploring the conceptual foundations of public humanism, emphasizing the importance of curiosity, generosity, and collaboration. As the course progresses, students engage with real-world case studies that demonstrate how humanities initiatives can reshape culture and society. Students will also experiment with designing a small-scale collaborative project, which allows them to transform their public concerns and humanistic inquiries into concrete outcomes. These projects serve as a starting point for their further development within and beyond the programs of public humanities. The course is designed for students interested in leveraging the humanities to enrich public culture.",

      "description": "This course is aimed at the students beginning their encounter with theory, in which they will learn the fundamental components of cultural criticism in terms of textuality and contextuality. Here the \" text\" is broadly defined as cultural artifacts, which includes filmic image, literary and historical narratives, social and everyday life experiences as well as media representation. The course materials are selected to give the students the basic information and guide to understand the object, the purpose and the method for cultural criticism. Topics discussed include intertextuality, defamiliarization, dramatic monologue, metaphor and montage, narratives and space-time structure, psychoanalysis and stream of consciousness, reader-response criticism and genre studies.",

This course first aims to facilitate students’ understanding of the rising discipline of cultural management, which is embedded in the transformative understanding of culture and the on-going global movement that highlights culture-led development. Second, it introduces the managerial approach to cultural assets, initiates students’ understanding of the relationship between arts management and the market system and government policies, and imparts the preliminary knowledge for the management of the arts. Third, it displays a spectrum of major issues in cultural management, such as cultural policy, cultural organizations and institutions, venue management and event programming, heritage, conservation and cultural tourism and cultural creative industries. The breadth of the discipline as indicated allows students’exposure to the basic cultural management concepts and strategies.",

We seldom consider, however, the powerful influence it has over our cultural identities. This course examines how the interplay between celebrity culture and the cultural industry shapes cultural identity with case studies from Hong Kong as the major scope of study. Starting with a brief history of Hong Kong celebrity culture from the 1980s to the present day, the course offers an entry point for students to understand the intricate relationship between the media and celebrity culture, encompassing a wide range of cultural icons and phenomena such as action film actors, cross-media megastars, and YouTube micro-celebrities. Each case study will engage with key concepts in celebrity culture, such as star-text, commodification, authenticity, extratextual reading, and participatory reading. The course proceeds by introducing the critical perspective of cultural studies in making sense of representation politics, public culture, fandom studies, and the diverse modes of intimacy in the digital age. Overall, students will gain an understanding of celebrity culture and how identities are thus produced, promoted, and commodified in the wider arena of media and popular culture.",

This course provides an understanding of the history, evolution, and universality of dance as an art form. Further, viewing dance as a social and cultural practice, the course aims at analyzing dance semantics and meanings in gestures, the interrelationship of dance and space, theatrical design and costumes, the formation of a dance to its social background, customs, as well as concepts of the self representation and embodiment in their dancing.  In particular, students will have opportunities to experience learning the gestures encoded symbolic meanings with narratives of dances. To demonstrate a physical understanding of a variety of dance forms, this course allows them to explore the pleasure of creative process of choreography in workshops.",

Ecological crisis, environmental degradation, and extreme weathers have become the watchwords of contemporary politics. The conventional boundaries between “nature” and “culture” are now being questioned. How do nature, culture and power intersect in our everyday life? How do we get to understand issues of sustainability and environmental crisis from a broad historical perspective and global activism angle? How are gender, class and race interact with technology, damaged environment, animal and plant species? This course explores these questions and the rich debates in the emerging field of environmental humanity and literature of the Anthropocene.Class topics are organized on major global green movements that resisted oil pollution, toxic factories, logging companies, dam constructions and nuclear plant building. Students get to learn the historical developments of major environmental activism in the West and the global south. How was the Greenpeace founded? What is the Narmada Dam Movement in India? Do you know Ken Saro-Wiwa, an environmental activist against Shell oil pollution in Nigeria? In each class we examine historical texts, visual materials and theoretical debates to explore how environmental justice has been intertwined with histories of colonialism, neoliberalism, and questions of gender, race, poverty and class. Together the class explores the problem of the Anthropocene (Nature) in the context of colonial history, grass root struggles (Culture) and corporation greed (Power).This course addresses many of the 17 United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Climate Actions (13), Life on Land (15), Life below Water (14), Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (16), Clean Energy (7), Reduced Inequalities (10), and Gender Inequality (5).

      "description": "This course is an introduction to the medical humanities, an interdisciplinary field of study that seeks to understand the social context of health and illness beyond the hospital, clinic, and laboratory. In particular, this course will emphasize the historical and cultural shaping of health disparities and examine how issues of power contribute to unequal patterns of risk and disease in our modern society. To do this, students will learn major theories and methods in the cultural study of health and medicine to understand how culture, power, and identity—including race, gender, capitalism, and colonialism— shapes the management of disease and individual illness experience in both Asian and global contexts. A critical concern in this course is how the organization of medical care confronts questions of social justice in medical treatment and public health in historical and contemporary contexts. Students will also grapple with the question of whether our institutions of medicine and public health function as a form of social control. By introducing students to the social components of health and illness, it aims to foster cross-disciplinary conversations across the faculties of arts, medicine, and other divisions at CUHK.Following the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of Reducing Inequality (SDG #10), a central question in this course is how medical treatments, research, and public health confront, or fail to confront, issues of social justice in global contexts. Students will learn theoretical approaches to health and inequality to investigate how history, culture, and politics shape the illness experience of socially marginalized people. These theories will enable students to assess the strengths and limits of our current arrangements of medical care and approaches to global health. In addition, students will learn critical medical humanities methods, such as ethnography, and use these methods to propose solutions to our current shortcomings in health governance. This course will challenge students to imagine better alternatives to our unequal world and demonstrate why the study of culture matters in medicine, global health, and public policy.",

Topics of the course will cover a wide range of subjects including identities, sexualities, temporalities, homophobia, activism, deviance, and transgression. This course is particularly suited for students who would like to acquire the knowledge of a particular theoretical approach and to engage it in a critical examination of literature and culture today.",

We explore how the extreme cultural and social diversity of the Asian region contributes to unique perspectives on bodies and identities. We are particularly interested in the studies of trans-Asian cultural flows, which includes not only commodities and entertainments but also migrations, like workers, and specific thoughts, like Maoism or human rights. We believe that a careful reading of these transnational flows would help us reconsider what Hong Kong culture and Chinese culture mean in contemporary bodies and indentity. We compare the cultural studies of local cultures with the discourses of trans-Asian studies and globalization, with the aim to demonstrate the possible ideological traps and strengths of taking Asia as an academic category for studying the body and culture.",

      "description": "The aim of this course is to introduce students to the Taoist literature in Chinese history. While there are many approaches to the understanding of the discipline of religion and literature, this course covers traditional Chinese literature in relation to Taoist thought, practice, institution, and symbolism. The focus is on the formation of literary genres as religious expression and transcendental imagination in the context, as much as possible, of the development of Taoist religion. This will allow us not only to realize literature as the principal record of Taoist tradition in its confirmation and valorization of Taoist values, but also to grapple with the literary challenge to inherited orthodoxies and thus the undermining of conventional ideas and feelings, as well as to sample the texture of literature functioning as an alternative or substitute for Taoism. In this way, we can approach the intersections of the aesthetic and the religious as the essential humanity through the reading and analysis of the Taoist dimensions of literature.",

As categories of analysis, students will use gender and religion to interrogate cultural production and social systems, paying close attention to how gender and religion intersect with other categories of social difference.

These authors provide an excellent progression in syntactical complexity while offering varied prose styles. Through these readings, students will strengthen their command of advanced Latin grammar, expand their vocabulary, and develop sophisticated translation techniques. Special attention will be given to developing sight-reading skills and mastering complex syntactical structures.

This course aims to bring students in touch with the major religious traditions and cultural patterns of India. It also aims to awaken appreciation and understanding of how diverse peoples of India negotiate their lives within this complex religious and cultural landscape. The main question and thematic thread running through the course will be how the various traditions understand, express, and practice embodiment and transcendence. In other words, what are the constituents, changes, relationships, and possibilities for human beings and divinities with reference to the temporal world and transcendent reality? Where can we find significant \"family resemblances\" – without ignoring differences – among the diversities of persons and sub-traditions within those roughly designated Hindu, Jain, Buddhist, Muslim, Sikh, or Christian?",

The downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republican China transformed the social and institutional organisation of the production, distribution, and consumption of art as well as the traditional patronage system in modern China. The structural changes conditioned the emergence of formal and informal art institutions that facilitated yet constrained artistic practices, laying the foundation for the development of a modern art world in China. The course looks at the history of modern Chinese art and the formation of different art institutions in the sociocultural and economic context of modern China. Weekly topics are structured chronologically and thematically, which cover a wide range of themes, including art schools, art societies, museums, exhibitions, and art market. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, the course offers students multi-perspectives to understand the transformation of modern Chinese art and the interactions between artistic practices and society in modern China.",

      "description": "“Curating,” a word that was once only used in museums, now has applications in everything in our lives, ranging from radio station DJs to almost all types of social media content. The popularity of the word reflects the growing importance of assembling, managing and presenting data and collection, a process of gathering information that brings maximum value relevant to different audiences.In this context, this course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to learn about both historical and contemporary examples of how culture is understood through exhibition design and curating. By covering various forms of curatorial traditions, disruptive ideas, and emergent digital practices in the ever-expanding field of curation, this course equips students with the ability to question what they take for granted and reflect on existing issues conducive to different cultures, values and beliefs. By the end of the course, students will be able to critically examine how knowledge is created inside and outside of art institutions and how curation could potentially become public knowledge.",

      "description": "The artworld is constructed through a network of individuals and institutions, all of which participate in con-tributing to the wider ecosystem of the global network and marketplace for art. The co-generative or mutu-ally constitutive nature between key players and institutions provides the context and rules for evaluating the aesthetic and economic value of art objects. In recent years, the art market has witnessed tremendous growth, and clusters of new galleries, global art fairs and auction houses have sprung up in cities within both developed and emerging economies, forming an ever-expanding network of art transitions, exhibi-tions, and causing an explosion of cultural activities amid various forms of urbanization. This course aims to provide students with theoretical knowledge and practical skills on how to identify the dynamic roles and activities of key players and institutions in the art market. It begins with an introduction to the history of art market, patronage system and art market logic. The, various practical skills are covered, including art valuation methods, techniques of buying and selling art, and agreements and laws that govern art transactions. In addition to practical skills, this course also encourages students to critically evaluate the complex relationships between the economy, aesthetic values and social behaviors within the global market-place. Special focus will be on emerging technologies and platforms concerning the global online art market.",

Through exploring a wide range of music literature from different historical periods in music, the course focuses on three main perspectives:The first perspective focuses on listening and examining the major masterpieces in the history of music from Middle Ages to Modern, in which musical elements and characteristics of major forms and genres will be introduced and analysed. The second perspective is identified by the relationship of music to culture, in which the influence that cultural, social, political and religious events have exerted on music will be discussed. The third perspective focuses on experiencing and examining the approaches of music education in advocating music in the society. Through experiential learning, students will be able to develop basic knowledge and skills for applying the current theories and approaches in music education (e.g. play-based approach, Orff Schulwerk, Dalcroze, Kodaly) to outreach and education in the society.",

      "description": "This course leads students to study various modes and philosophies of visual arts management undertaken in different venues. Aesthetics and art criticisms are critical in directing art interpretation and presentation. Contemporary management of visual arts responds predominantly to the worldwide discussions on modernism as well as various post-modernist writings. In addition, it has to operate in accordance with the prescribed state policy. For this bilateral concern of art management, the course comprises two sections. The first section leads students to study the writings on aesthetics by critics from Plato to Foucault, whose arguments are still valid in inspiring many art exhibitions. The second section discusses the practical concerns and techniques in maximizing the social and economic impacts of art exhibitions and relevant events. Both sections discuss case studies taken from different parts of the world.",

      "description": "(UGEC3481 is double-coded with CURE3003.)  How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William’s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals’ life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park – Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla – Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo – Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.",

How are dominant understandings and practices of gender constructed and contested in different cultural forms and social contexts? This course is divided into three sections. The first section introduces the basic vocabulary of gender studies and how gender intersects with other forms of differences. The second section explores gender through various cultural products and media (e.g. literature, film, video games, theatre, social activism, etc.) The final section examines key debates in relation to gender in specific social contexts. Upon completion of this course, students would understand basic theoretical concepts for gender analysis and key debates on gender as well as gain the ability to think critically about gender.",

Through a body of fiction, films, T.V. shows, computer mediated communication devices, cybercultural forms (VR and AI), etc., which deal directly with new communication technologies, this class will highlight the radical effects on the centrality of visual culture in the modern world, on the post-modernist self and on virtuality of all kinds.",

This course is a survey of Southeast Asian cinema read against the backdrop of its distinct historical, political, ecological, and cultural conditions. Initially a Cold War construct comprising Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, and Timor-Leste, the term ‘Southeast Asia’ has come to refer to a highly complex and pluralistic region of over 660 million people, 25,000 islands, and 150 ethnolinguistic communities. With its national identities formed from the encounter with and struggle against American, British, French, Dutch, Hispanic, Indian, Japanese, and Chinese influence, Southeast Asia’s movies have served as venues for propaganda and resistance. This course looks at how the remediations of different genres such as noir, melodrama, western, and sci-fi tackle controversial issues of gender, race, religion, poverty, migration, and the environment. Instead of smoothening the continuity of official historical narratives, it uncovers how documentaries, epics, and horror reexamine the trauma of past colonization, authoritarianism, and violence. To conclude, the course explores how television serials, anthology films, and online databases trace nascent cross-border and intra-regional communities beyond the limits of sovereignty.",

Thus, this course aims to introduce contemporary art and its representational aesthetics to consider various socio-cultural issues regarding art circulation and its interpretation, the connotation of contemporary art in society. The works of various contemporary artists will be presented in the context of focal issues that invoke social practices, conventional modality of contemporary art scene, shifting art interpretation within the norms and values in a society, relational art and public engagement, experimental use of media. In each week we will analyze contemporary art with specific themes, emphasizing the recurrent motifs and issues in contemporary art and its politics of representation, such as situation and activism, space, ruin and urbanity/modernity, trauma and memory in history, animality and non-human subjectivity, post-human and prosthetic body, gender and sexuality, queer art, magic (the material culture of the weird and eerie, ghost and monstrous iconography), cuteness as a concept reflecting from the contemporary popular cultural reference. Close readings in both academic and art critical practices, class discussion and participation will culminate in a final individual research paper interrogating the implications of representational tactics and strategies of a single artist and/or artwork in contemporary art.",

      "description": "This course prepares students to learn from the emerging practices of community making. Through an introduction to the basic concepts, exploration of the origins, development, and implementation, students will understand the emerging intervention methods of humanities in the public domain.Community making is closely related to sustainable development, involving the application of interdisciplinary theories. Special attention will be given to practical case studies in this course, helping students examine community making practices in the local and neighboring regions, including Japan, Mainland China, and Taiwan. Students will also have the opportunity to personally understand the lived experiences of different communities/groups, and cross-reference them with relevant theories to deepen their understanding.In this course, students will acquire knowledge on how community making affects community cultural history, construction of collective identity, community participation, cross-sectoral collaboration, and the accumulation of social capital. This course will guide students to initially grasp the roles and collaborative dynamics among the diverse stakeholders in the community, including government departments, social welfare organizations, civic groups, and community organizations, as well as advisory frameworks.",

      "description": "This course explores the art of writing across various formats and media. Designed to enhance students’ critical and creative capabilities, the course is divided into three parts: cultural criticism, media writing, and transmedia storytelling.The first section focuses on the function, language, and format of cultural criticism. The course introduces the core principles of writing critique on literature, films, popular culture, and visual art. Students are invited to discuss the works both aesthetically and critically. Another section of the course focuses on the fundamental skills specific to the media forms of print, digital platforms, and social media. Foregrounded with a comprehensive understanding of media infrastructures, students will be able to develop skills in collecting information, generating ideas, organizing the structure of their writing, and effectively presenting their thoughts.The final section draws on Henry Jenkins’s concept of “convergence.” We will compare the conventions of traditional narratives with the world of transmedia storytelling, including but not limited to the ‘converging’ realms of YouTube, podcasts, and interactive content on social media. Students will learn to develop storytelling skills while making good use of media platforms for content distribution.",

Students are required to have previously taken CURE2066 or possess a solid understanding of visual design principles, as well as basic proficiency in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere, along with some experience in beginner-level photography.The course is comprised of lectures, readings, workshops, and practical image projects. Compared to CURE2066, this course delves further into advanced techniques of using Adobe Premiere and combines them with foundational skills in Adobe After Effects to explore the process of creating various visual effects. Building upon the instructional foundation of conventional elements in video production, such as photography, recording, and lighting, this course also covers and practices multiple shooting methods, including mobile photography, sports photography, and drone photography. These various shooting approaches enable students to effectively convey their creative ideas through rich visual forms, helping them explore and develop their own visual expression style while preparing them for future employment opportunities.",

It allows students to become aware of the issues, difficulties and strategies involved in cross-cultural transfer and translation. The phenomenon of cultural accommodation and/or transgression as well as inter-religious dialogue in the process of translation will be critically examined. Selected texts may include Chinese translations of the Bible, the Koran, the Buddhist scriptures, missionary tracts and religious allegories like The Pilgrim's Progress. The English translations of Chinese religious novels like Wu Cheng'en's The Journey to the West and Cao Xueqin's The Story of the Stone will also be analyzed.",

      "description": "The Union Version of the Bible (1919) constitutes an important factor in shaping modern Chinese literature and the vernacular movement in the early twentieth century. A large number of works of May Fourth writers (such as Lu Xun, Bing Xin and Xu Dishan) are filled with biblical images, themes, allusions and quotations. Meanwhile, many Chinese translations of the Bible are heavily influenced by the Chinese cultural and literary traditions. For instance, Yan Fu’s translation of the Gospel of Mark employs an elegant style of classical Chinese, while Wu Jingxiong’s Psalms adopts the refined forms of Shijing (The Book of Songs) and Chuci (The Songs of Chu). This course aims to examine the intricate interactions between Chinese literature and the Bible, particularly the influences of Chinese literary traditions on the translations of the Bible and the rhetorical influences of the Bible on the emergence of modern Chinese literature, with a view to widening students’ perspectives in the interdisciplinary study of literature and religion.",

As a lively epitome of Chinese religious culture, these novels also promoted the spread of religious thoughts among the people. This course aims to investigate the interactive relationship between Chinese novels and religion. Students will be guided to examine the religious contents in novels and the ways in which religious thoughts shape the themes, narratives, characterization and language of the novels. Texts selected for reading include classical and modern novels, such as Strange Tales of Liaozhai, The Story of the Stone and The Journey to the West.",

It offers students a lively and effective learning experience through fieldwork. There are two options for fieldwork which students can choose from. 1: Visiting various Hindu, Sikh and Jain temples in Hong Kong2: A 10 day visit to India that will include visiting both religious and historical sites.In both cases students will learn through first-hand exposure to religious relics, sites, material culture and personal interactions with Indian practitioners of different faiths. The sites of visit will be organized and led by experienced member(s) of the teaching staff. Sites to be visited in Hong Kong and India will include mainstream traditions within the broad framework of Hinduism, such as the Vaishnava Bhakti movement and the Shaiva tradition. Field work will also include visits to traditions that originally arose as challenges to mainstream Hinduism such as the Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs. There will be six lectures conducted on campus prior to the fieldwork that will offer students an overview of the geographical, philosophical and historical background of the sites that will be visited and the traditions we will interact with. Students who select option 1 will spend the rest of the term on fieldwork in Hong Kong. This will be planned together with the instructor. For students who select option 2 a ten day trip to India during the Christmas holidays will be arranged. Fieldwork should add up to approximately 21 hours of off campus learning which will include on-site lectures, on-the-spot investigations and tutorial discussions during the trip. Both a pre-trip and a post-trip assignment in the form of a reading report, essay and/or presentation are required. .

It emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of the field and encourages students to challenge and reflect on “Eurocentric” theories and practices of heritage. Structured thematically, the first part of the course covers current debates in both the theory and practice of cultural heritage, including issues such as definition, authenticity, ethics, tangible and intangible heritage, cultural rights, commodification, sustainability, and inclusiveness. The second part of the course uses case studies from Hong Kong to examine how certain sites or practices have been institutionalized and listed as local or international heritages. It also explores various models of defining and managing Hong Kong's cultural heritage. By the end of the course, students will be able to think beyond “Eurocentric” heritage concepts and practices, and be aware of the correlation between Hong Kong cultural heritage, identity, and community.",

Today, curators are active agents in social and cultural transformation, taking part in dynamic projects presented by museums, commercial galleries, non-profit art spaces, biennials, art fairs, and many disruptive platforms beyond the field of art that didn’t previously exist. Curators produce knowledge, engage their audience, spark innovation, and constantly challenge the role of “curator” beyond the confines of the status quo across varied institutional settings. This course aims to provide students with hands-on experience in exhibition curation and engages students in a broad spectrum of real-world experiences and professional networking opportunities, aiming to prepare students for future curatorial projects/jobs. It covers topics such as idea conceptualization, proposal writing, pitching, budgeting, contracting, publication, exhibition design, installation and exhibition maintenance. By co-curating an exhibition in a non-profit art space in Hong Kong, students will take part in the various stages of exhibition making. With a focus on exhibition experience, audience engagement, and sociability, this course will train students in the role of being a curator and enable students to develop leadership skills and critically apply knowledge conducive to creative outcomes.",

In recent years, technological advancements have further enhanced the use of digital media and social networking in cultural heritage, fostering new connections between visitors and heritage. Consequently, the interpretation of cultural heritage remains dynamic and fluid, embracing a variety of approaches and philosophies.This course aims to provide students with a broad knowledge of cultural heritage interpretations and the theoretical frameworks that offer different lenses and approaches for thinking about cultural heritage. It covers various types of cultural heritage, the role of storytelling in heritage interpretation, heritage as public discourse, identity issues, visitor engagement and education, tourism, community involvement, and ethical issues. Additionally, this course will examine how technology plays a role in engaging audiences and facilitating interpretations. By offering students diverse concepts of cultural heritage interpretations, they will gain a comprehensive understanding of current interpretive approaches, emerging trends, and innovations in the interpretation of heritage.",

      "description": "Departing from the dominant canon of critical theory, this course aims to introduce students to a wider, more diverse range of theoretical texts and frameworks by marginalized voices and from peripheral locations.This course seeks to decolonize theory by multiplying the sites of intellectual and critical inquiry. Instead of treating Benjamin, Adorno, Hall, and Grossberg as representative of the corpus of theory, it engages with prevailing discussions in Postcolonial Studies, Modernity/Coloniality, and Black Studies. It moves beyond the call for ‘de-Westernization’ by looking at theoretical texts and frameworks produced in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The course concludes by exploring work about indigeneity, memory, and environmentalism. The course is designed for advanced undergraduates with familiarity in critical approaches to literature, cinema, art, and media. Classes will grapple with the following questions: What qualifies as theory? Is theory necessarily abstract? What is the relationship of theory to particularity and difference? How can theory be made more attune to its contexts of production, dissemination, and application? How can film and visual art offer sources for theorizing? How might theoretical frameworks respond more significantly to social, economic, and environmental conditions from the restructuring of the capitalist system, expansion of media networks, dissolution of national borders, and deterioration of the climate crisis?",

      "description": "The course will offer an introduction to critical views on pornography, which is defined as sexually explicit media within different cinematic traditions and digital screen cultures. The aim of the course is to show that pornography is a not a unified screen culture but consists of varied representations within cultural contexts. The course will teach students how to analyze these representations and how to take into account their cultural histories. The course will take a Cultural Studies approach and examine within specific cultural environments and include the positions of anti-porn and pro-porn activists. Therefore students will get an overview of diverging perspectives while being encouraged to consider their own values and critical responses. Students will be asked to respond to theories and audio-visual examples, while actively partaking in debates about pornography and its impact on religion, gender, sexuality, health, labor and economy. Finally, the course will pay special importance to how contemporary sexually explicit media are impacting new user groups such young adult netizens, female consumers, disabled people, as well as ethnic and sexual minorities. Students will carry out a major assignment while learning how to apply ethnographic research methods to analyze representations of the body and sexuality within screen cultures. In this assignment, they will focus on a media environment/platform and a sexual culture of their choice to find out how culture is being redefined and visualized by media users. Two workshops will be organized in the media lab in order to train the students in different methods and perspectives on digital ethnographyLanguage of instruction: Classes and assignments will be carried out in the English language and students’ active participation in both lectures and tutorials will be required. Students can carry out ethnographic fieldwork in Cantonese or any language of your choice, but need to present the results in English.Learning Activities: Students are required to attend a 3-hour class each week. The course combines theoretical lectures with the viewing of films and media examples. There will also be tutorial sessions each week based on the lectures and on the weekly readings. All students are required to post weekly reflections on Blackboard and to participate in discussions. In addition to the weekly readings and reflections, students will conduct research and planning for their assessments and oral presentations independently and in groups.Please be advised that this course will involve some screenings and discussions of sexually explicit materials and category III films. Therefore, students under 18 years-old are advised not to take this course.",

It comprises three blocks: Block 1 unfolds an overall picture of the phenomenon, introduces the related concepts, displays the disciplinary foundation of this topic, traces its history, and discusses the rationales and developing tendency. Block 2 studies the urban sociological and economic approaches employed in developing the theoretical foundation, highlighting a transition in capitalist production mode and urban governance upheld by public-private partnership modes. Criticisms are also presented to complete a dialectic mindset of this phenomenon. With a strong practical dimension, Block 3 teaches students various methods to make consultancy and policy recommendations for culture-led urban development projects. A variety of practices that constitute the culture-led strategy are discussed, such as how to plan for a creative city and cultural facilities, how to boost creative industries and develop cultural quarters and creative clusters, as well as how to revitalize historic quarters.",

Heritage is increasingly utilized by creative industries, with its assets digitized, interpreted, and experienced through advanced technologies such as AI and VR. Ensuring the continued relevance of cultural heritage has become a critical issue.This course aims to provide students with an understanding of cultural heritage and its diverse modern applications, along with the critical concepts that shape our perception of its relevance today.

This course is an advanced version, because it will touch on debated issues regarding museums. It focuses on installation, display, and site management. The purposes of the course may be summarized as follows: 1. What are the various display methods in museums? What are the concerns involved in selecting the ‘right’ ones? 2. How are museum workers (non-curatorial) trained? 3. What are the essential facilities a museum is expected to have? Why? 4. What is the role of museum in the contemporary arts, which is the area of debate regarding its significance and curatorship? The course develops students’ awareness towards global developments in world-class museums, so that they are equipped with skills and knowledge necessary for long-term competition in museums or other cultural institutions.",

      "description": "Cultural institutions such as museums, archives, and cultural centers play a critical role in the preservation, interpretation, and dissemination of heritage. Through diverse programs, place-making projects, and cultural policies, these institutions preserve and represent cultural memory, sustain community identity and continuity, and emphasize the importance of community involvement and participatory approaches. They ensure that both tangible and intangible heritage are accessible to the public and future generations. Additionally, they intersect with contemporary issues such as the impact of globalization, tourism, the role of policy-making and advocacy in heritage protection, and the influence of the digital age on cultural heritage.This course aims to provide students with both analytical and practical skills in managing cultural heritage, with a particular emphasis on intangible heritage, which includes oral histories, performative rituals, social practices, and craftsmanship. Students will engage with diverse topics, exploring how the principles and practices of heritage management inform a variety of theories and approaches, such as cultural relativism, ethnocentrism, and post-colonial theory. By focusing on a chosen area of cultural heritage or a particular field of heritage theory, this course will equip students with the ability to reflect on the challenges and opportunities presented by historical and current phenomena and to participate in projects with the potential to impact individuals and societies.",

This requires a deep understanding of the artists' intentions, the works' context, and diverse cultural expressions, as well as a commitment to preserving heritage and promoting dialogue. Curators play a crucial role in ensuring representation, authenticity, and inclusivity in the audience's experience. In recent years, the concept of curating has extended to social media, where it involves strategically choosing and presenting content to engage a digital audience. This includes managing visuals, texts, and interactive elements to create a compelling online presence.

This course aims to provide students with both analytical and practical skills in curation.
