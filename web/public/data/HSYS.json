Health Economics, as a field, attempts to provide an explicit and rationale framework to improve the efficient and equitable allocation of health care resources. In this course, we will examine selected topics in health economics that have major implications for healthcare delivery, financing and clinical and public health research. Essential economic theories and methods for exploring each topic will be discussed, along with the role of markets and government. We will go through different models of healthcare financing from a policymaking perspective, applying measures such as equity and efficiency to evaluate them. In addition, basic skills of conducting economic evaluation, such as cost-effectiveness analysis, will also be introduced.",

These local visits supplement the classroom teaching. The work of summarising and presenting their observations would help to consolidate the learning from visiting these organisations. To satisfy the requirement for this course, the student needs to participate in one local visit to healthcare organization, and one local visit to a non-healthcare organization, participate in one presentation session and submit a reflective essay.",
