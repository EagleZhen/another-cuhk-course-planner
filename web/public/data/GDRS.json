      "description": "(UGEC1209 is double-coded with GDRS1001.)  This course aims to develop students’ ability to analyze the everyday life through the lens of gender. Drawing on the interdisciplinary nature of Women’s and Gender Studies, the course will guide students to examine how gender works as one of the primary social organizing principles in the movies we watch, the housework we do, the behaviors we express and many other daily activities that have been routinized. The first three lectures will equip students with a critical gender lens by questioning biology and getting familiar with theories of gender role, socialization, gender schema, doing gender and queer theory. All concepts to be explored in class will be explained with reference to research. At the end of the course, students will come to understand how political their personal life is. In particular, the course hopes to inspire students to take part in creating social change for gender equality, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",

Students will be exposed to a variety of quantitative methodologies, and recognize gender bias in the application of research methods. The course adopts a combination of lectures, class discussion, and analytical practices. We will go through the different phases in the research process of formulating research questions, designing measurements and hypotheses, choosing of methods for accessing sources, conducting data analysis, and writing reports. Students will develop the critical awareness of quantitative methods through discussion and application of research methods and be prepared to design their own research project in the real setting with the quantitative research methods they learn in class. They will be able to reflect upon the choice and application of research methods from a gender perspective in their own research.",

      "description": "The qualitative research methods are an essential skill in the contemporary world and are widely used in gender studies. Having the gender lens in qualitative research lends itself greater importance as it helps to uncover the mechanism and the intersectional social forces giving shape to forms of inequalities, identities, and communities. As AI and big data are the buzz words today to restructure the future work force, qualitative research skills are becoming increasingly important in a world that are gradually governed by machines. People are not satisfied with merely algorithmic associations but want to know the meanings, emotions, sensibility, and identities behind data. Qualitative methods in gender studies capacitate us to engage in deep reflection about the process, dynamics, and the deeper structure of the social world to come up with a better solution to many problems of inequality. Gender studies is an interdisciplinary field, but in this course, we will focus on the qualitative research methods used by feminist inquires in the social sciences. Students will be exposed to a variety of qualitative research methods from fieldwork to beyond. Epistemology of gender research and what is considered feminist research will be introduced. We will cover important qualitative cases and the associated ethical issues. In order to understand the process of applying qualitative research methods, students will apply the knowledge learned in class through designing and conducting their own mini qualitative research project. They will report the progress of their research in class through group presentations or assignments to receive constructive comments from the instructor and fellow students. Respect and tolerance of different voices are important to the course.",

This course aims to introduce students to the tools and frameworks needed to approach DEI from a leadership perspective. Students will gain a deep understanding of the organizational, cultural, and intergroup contexts in which DEI initiatives arise, which DEI initiatives work and why, the drivers that motivate DEI initiatives, and the opportunities and barriers to building effective DEI initiatives in organizations. The course is designed to help students navigate diverse organizational settings more effectively, work within and lead diverse teams, and apply DEI frameworks to address organizational challenges. The course also provides students with the opportunity to critically discuss topics such as identity, discrimination, micro-aggressions, and equity in society, and how these themes relate to organizational issues of power, privilege, opportunity, inclusion, innovation, and organizational effectiveness. By the end of the course, students will have the knowledge and skills to be inclusive leaders and advance DEI in business and other settings.",

      "description": "(UGED3208 is double-coded with GDRS3004.)  This course reviews basic concepts, theories and research findings of romantic love and intimate relationship. Various aspects of romantic love and intimate relationship will be critically reviewed. Based on research from a wide range of disciplines including gender studies, cultural studies, sociology, psychology, counselling, media studies, among various fields, together with input from literature and popular culture, the course will cover major areas such as the following: how do we understand the notions of “love” and “intimacy” in the different social and personal contexts, what are the different stages in a relationship; the influence of cultural myths and social scripts; interpersonal processes within romantic relationships (such as attraction, social cognition, communication and conflicts, etc.); how social gender role shapes romantic feelings and behaviors; notions of equality and freedom within relationships; power and violence; intimate relationship across life span, etc. Students are encouraged to actively reflect upon their own life experience, to engage in critical discussions of cultural phenomenon through case studies, and learn to untangle the cultural myths, norms, and stereotypes that shapes our private lives and our society in general. Upon the completion of the course, students should demonstrate basic understanding of structure, functions, dynamics, and development of romantic love and other interpersonal relationship. The personal is political. As personal relationships are the most basic social relationships that makes up the larger network of social relationships, it is hope that students could use knowledge from this course as an insight to understand, develop, and improve the quality of their own interpersonal relationship, and would aspire to build a more open and equal society starting from equalitarian and mindful personal relationships.",

Based on a cross-cultural perspective, we will read and analyze different meanings of gender and sexuality, and how these meanings are constructed. In a context of modernization campaigns and globalization processes, this course illustrates how gender relations and sexual politics are related with historical backgrounds, cultural heritage, market expansion, ideological shifts, and capitalist dynamics. The topics of gender and sexuality will be interwoven with that of migration, work, family, popular culture, mass media, and consumerism. The course will help students to understand issues of discrimination against women and girls, unpaid care and domestic work, access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and equal rights to economic resources, and to reflect on how to promote gender equality (SDG5 among 17 Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs, in the 2030 development agenda). Students will be encouraged to explore localized knowledge and living experiences of gender and sexuality, and to think critically about how to reduce inequality (SDG10) related to social systems of sex and gender.",

      "description": "(UGEC3204 is double-coded with GDRS3006.)  Living Feminisms is all about how to put feminism into practice. Specifically, it is concerned with living out feminist consciousness in every step of making fundamental and lasting social change. With this in mind, Living Feminisms is not an exposition of feminist theories per se but an exploration of how social change effort would look like when we take up feminist consciousness that transcends separateness and duality. It explores the root causes that lead to the domination system that has plagued humanity for centuries, examines the possibility of having a fundamental and lasting social transformation that supports life of all, and takes a closer look at a few selected alternative practices such as restorative justice and sharing economies that hold out hope in times of crises. The course also equips students with practical knowledge of being a change agent, introducing some practices with feminist consciousness that transform limiting beliefs about social change, nourish resilience by taking care of social and political trauma, and cultivate need-based facilitation skills and leadership that help navigate conflicts in the process of making internal as well as external transformation. To put it in a nutshell, Living Feminisms is a course that cultivates change agents with feminist consciousness.Living Feminisms deeply resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint for building a sustainable future by 2030. The course directly touches on alternative practices working towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).",

Students will be empowered to take lead in change effort through collaboration with others and mastery of conflict transformation skills.\nStudents will learn to appreciate making a sustainable future requires transformation in areas broader than the conventionally defined economic realm.",
      "course_syllabus": "Class 1: How We Got Where We Are and Where Are We Heading?\n·\nRiane Eisler and Douglas P. Fry’s biocultural approach that explains the perpetuation of domination systems through the interaction between genes, brain development and culture, and points to ways where hope lies\nClass 2: How Change Happens? A Lesson from Feminists\n·\nInvestigating over 100 organizations in 15-year longitudinal research, Aruna Rao et al. develop a model of change that sheds lights on the mechanism of social transformation\n·\nCristina Bicchieri’s work delves into the formation and change of norms\nClass 3:\nWhat Makes Things Stuck? Inaction Explained\n·\nHow can we explain inaction of people witnessing immense suffering of others? Is the notion of false consciousness adequate? Joanna Macy, a Buddhist scholar and a veteran environmentalist, offers us some glimpse\nClass 4:\nPractice\n: Retelling a New Story and Reconnecting to Life that We All Share\n·\nUnderstanding the impact of separateness at cognitive level is important but far from complete, Sharif Abdullah and Gretchen Ki Steidle offer us some practical advice on healing the deep-seated separateness by retelling a new story about human beings that fosters interdependence\nClass 5:\nTaking Action: Violent or Nonviolent or Both?\n·\nTaking action to initiate change at various levels of a society is commonplace for activists. What is important is the kinds of action we undertake What is nonviolence? How does it work? What are its limits?\nClass 6:\nSocial Trauma and Social Transformation\n·\nTrauma is an overwhelming experience that outweighs the containing capacity of our nervous system How does trauma relate to and shape our political behaviors? Rather individualizing trauma as a single person experiences, how can we theorize collective trauma?\nClass 7:\nPractice\n: Self-Care & Inner Resources\n·\nChange agents are prone to feel despair, powerlessness and hopelessness because they are more acutely aware of the enormity of suffering How to nourish our heart to make it open to pain and suffering while keeping the passion alive?\nClass 8:\nReconciliation and Justice: Exploring Transitional Justice\n·\nCommon collective responses to atrocities are either forgetting or vengeance. Is transitional justice a viable third way? How does it work? What are the experiences of the 40 Truth and Reconciliation Commissions that have ever set up in human history can tell us?\nClass 9:\nSexual Violence: Exploring Restorative Justice\n·\nOur current justice system is a kind of retribution that punishes those who violate the law. How does it look like if we shift from retribution to restoration that focuses on needs and rebuilding of broken relationships? How controversial is it when applying to sexual violence?\nClass 10:\nCollaboration and Feminist Leadership: Coming to Terms with Power\n·\nActivism often entails working with others. Is power necessarily evil? How does feminist leadership look like? How can we consciously use power in a way that does not subjugate but empower others? How can we replace power-over with power-with, power-to and power-within?

      "description": "(UGEC3229 is double-coded with GDRS3007.)  This course examines men’s diverse experiences as boys/men and public discourses and practices about masculinities. It will focus on how the gendered social order influences men’s actions and the way men perceive themselves, other men, women, and social situations. It will pay special attention to the exploration of the relationships between multiple dimensions of social relations and inequalities including gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation. It will address issues such as: male socialization, boyhood culture, male body images, male friendship, male sexuality and fertility, men’s experiences as fathers, male aggression and violence, men’s commitments to sports and work, and media representations of boys and men in contemporary culture. It will also explore female masculinities and queer masculinities and to what extent they post challenges to hegemonic masculinity. Students will be introduced to the latest developments and their global networks, and to evaluate the prospects for social change in how men may think, feel, and act otherwise.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) through critical engagement with different discourses and phenomenon related to masculinities.",

      "description": "(UGEC3228 is double-coded with GDRS3008.)  This course examines the social construction of minorities and the history of Hong Kong public policy towards them, including legal changes, social institutions, immigration policy, and political mobilization. Current debates in public policies such as anti-discrimination legislation, education policies of ethnic minorities, disciplining of youth and anti-poverty scheme will also be evaluated within this context. We will draw on an array of intellectual resources ranging from political economy, critical race theory, feminism, phenomenology and queer theory to examine issues about racial/ethnic minorities, the economically underprivileged, minorities with disabilities, sexual/erotic minorities, gender minorities and youth in light of the latest scholarly discussions on multiculturalism, pluralism and the politics of difference and social recognition.The course is relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) with a focus on how public policy plays an important role in obstructing and facilitating the attainment of these goals.",

      "description": "(UGEC3224 is double-coded with GDRS3009.)  This course examines issues revolving the family as a social institution in different cultures. It explores processes of how the family is constructed in different forms as it intersects with various social systems including kinship, marriage, class, ethnicity, religion, and political economy. Particular attention is paid to how family as a gendered construction, while being a basic principle of social life globally, exhibits great diversity as it shapes and is shaped by local histories, traditions, and state policies. In an era of globalization and transnational mobility, the ideology and practice of the family are rapidly changing, but there are simultaneously trends of reversion and localization. Students will read ethnographies and develop cross-cultural perspectives on classic and contemporary issues concerning the family, such as work and domesticity, motherhoods and fatherhoods, sexual orientations, reproductive technologies, surrogacy and adoption. Students learn to critically think and articulate about family issues, and will acquire enhanced knowledge and skills in reflexive thinking and positive communication, cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion. The course is relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, in particular SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).",

      "course_syllabus": "1. The Family: An anthropological perspective (SDG #5, 10, 16)\nThe family is often imagined to be a social institution with a set of values and relationships shared by everyone in society. This is far from reality. In this lecture we look at the definitions of family across cultures, and look at how family interacts with different social systems such as religion, political system and modes of production, and investigate how family values may differ in different ethnic groups and how they change over time. Concepts of cultural relativism and holism will be introduced.\n2. Kinship and lineage (SDG #5, 10)\nKinship and lineage have played an important part in the political economy of society, in the past as well as in present time. In this lecture we discuss the commonalities as well as the differences across cultures, and look at the factors leading to continuity and/or change, such as urbanization, globalization, appearance of reproductive technologies, adoption, surrogacy, and changing values in sexuality.\n3. Role of marriage in family (SDG #5, 10, 16)\nThis lecture looks at how marriage may or may not be related to family formation, and the role of marriage in society. In addition, marriage regulations and practices are highly related to gender ideologies. These relations exist in diverse forms and have transformed over time, for example as governments promulgate new marriage laws and as civil society demands for reform.\n4. Domesticity and gender division of labor (SDG #5, 10, 16)\nHow was the idea “man are breadwinners; women are homemakers” formulated in history and how is it challenged in contemporary society? This lecture will discuss issues of domesticity and how gender division of labor at home is related to the gender division of labor in society. We will examine the roles of religion and science, as well as of the church and government in the production of gendered social arrangements. Students will learn to identify systemic barriers to gender equality.\n5. Violence against Women (SDG #5, 16)\nWhy are women the majority of victims of domestic violence across cultures? Why do many women choose to stay in abusive relations? In this lecture we look at the social and cultural factors that influence women’s decision to confront, escape, or endure domestic violence, and discuss how family and ideologies and practices have played a part in the perpetuation of VAW in different cultures. Students will investigate potential solutions for VAW as a form of gender inequality.\n6. Parenthood and socialization (SDG #5, 10)\nDo all parents love their children? Do parents in different cultures raise their children the same way? Why is raising children in families with same-sex parents, single parents, and migrant parents considered problematic? If socialization is the way to reproduce socially acceptable individuals, what form, content, and means should it take? This lecture seeks to dispel the misconception that parent-child relations are natural and uniform, by looking at the diverse forms of parenthood and ways of socialization in different cultures.\n7. Spousal relations: duties, affection, and intimacy (SDG #5, 10)\nHow is spousal relationship culturally constructed? What are the components of spouse-hood and how do they relate to politics, economics, religion and other social systems? Why do extra-marital affairs happen and how does society deal with it? This lecture looks at the ideology and practice of spouse-hood across different cultures, and asks what role it has in formulating the family as social institution.\n8. Globalization, affluence and livelihood (SDG #5, 10, 16)\nThis lecture looks at global transformation processes and how they affect the family both as a social institution and as a network of related individuals. We look at how consumerism, social media, and converging values seemingly sync-ing familial structures and emotions across the globe, but at the same time noting how families in different societies, as they undergo globalization and wealth polarization, are torn by desires of economic growth and downward social mobility.\n9. Transnational mobility and family (SDG #5, 10)\nIn an era of globalization, more and more people cross national borders for a better life, creating transnational families as family members live in different countries in the form of split households, or as individuals become members of family in a different culture. In this lecture we look at this growing phenomenon and discuss issues about acculturation, family relations and power dynamics, how affines and agnates create transnational communities, and what happens to those who are left behind in the hometown.\n10. New kinship and alternative family (SDG #5, 10)\nWe will discuss how arrangements such as same-sex marriage, cohabitation, and polygamous relations would challenge conventional understandings of kinship and family in society. We will reflect on these issues in relation to contemporary debates on heterosexual normativity, monogamy, and same-sex relations.\n11. Doing family in China (SDG #5, 16)\nThe concept of family has various levels of meanings in Chinese culture, and throughout Chinese history these have transformed in response to the needs and ideologies of the time. While Han families may share certain idealized views of the family as a social system, its practice is perhaps as varied as the number of families. Ethnic groups and Chinese overseas communities add to this complexity as their worldviews, religions, and socioeconomic environments acculturate thinking and behavior that differ from what is understood as Chinese core values.\n12. Doing family in Asia (SDG #5, 16)\nThis lecture will bring together ethnographic cases in Asia to illustrate the interaction of different social systems revolving around the family. By comparing changes and continuities of family formation and relations in the region using a cross-cultural perspective, we are able to reflect on our own culture, and understand the pros and cons of the ideologies and practices that we are socialized in.\n13. Family, power, and intersectionality (SDG #5, 10, 16)\nThis lecture discusses individuals’ multi-layered identities and how these intersect with family membership. We will examine roles, statuses and power generated from positions in the family, gender and ethnicity, at work and school, on the media and more. The multiple locales in which individuals perform their everyday experiences are examined holistically, which helps us rethink how seemingly “natural” behavior are really cultural constructs, and how taken-for-granted ideas of family membership shape our everyday lives, our life goals as individuals, and the regulations and resources that constitute society.",

      "description": "This course is one of the first courses dedicated to understanding trans-ness and trans-hood grounded in lived transgender experience in the East-Asian, especially the Sinophone, context. Conceptualised and co-taught by a trans person, the course adopts a holistic life approach, informed by first hand trans-perspective, in examining different aspects of our cis-hetero-patriarchal society (among many other exclusionary structures such as ableism, racism, ageism, etc.) through trans encounters in the everyday. Starting with tracing the evolution of terms in relation to the transgender identity, the exploration would be followed by reflections of the origin of the idea of “trans”, namely that of transgression and crossing-over, as an act of going beyond binaries. When inspecting gender frameworks in the “non-West”, especially those of formerly colonized societies, we can see how different understandings and imaginations of sex, gender, and sexuality would yield very different identifications, and thus human possibilities. Following more conceptual reflections, the second part of the course would be focused on societal structures as lived trans experiences, ranging from more social topics such as design and access of public facilities, the omnipresence of gender as identifier in everyday spaces and institutions, legal struggle for rights and recognition, to more intimate ones such as natal family ties, romantic relationship, sexual explorations and expressions, and reproductive experiments.The final part of the course would be an exploration beyond, reaching out to situate transgender issues within a larger context of other movements for progress and equal rights. Drawing from his experience as the city’s most prominent trans activist and a transgender support group organizer for over a decade, the instructor will be guiding the students in a critical examination of important debates within and outside of the transgender and the extended queer community, inspecting in-depth the simultaneous solidarity and tensions among different groups, from the increasing polarization and politicization of different interpretations of Feminism, to questioning the “imagined community” of LGBTQIA+ comradeship in HK and abroad, reflecting on the standing of transgender persons and transgender issues in the here and now.  The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) through critical engagement with different aspects, discourses, and phenomenon related to trans identities and their life experiences.",

      "description": "(UGED3206 is double-coded with GDRS3011.)  In 21st century post-colonial Hong Kong, the preservation of ‘collective memory’ of this fast-changing city has become an everyday discourse. From award-winning movies, heart-warming testimonies, tabloid stories to Facebook groups and social campaigns, we have been consuming, constructing, and circulating narratives of ‘the past’. This act of remembering and exploring ‘our history’ questions a mainstream Hong Kong story of success demonstrated by economic development and material wealth, and attempts to identify discontinuities, gaps and silenced voices in the dominating narrative. It has also prompted reflections on the relation between narrative and identity — personal, collective, and spatial — in historical inquiry, and in what ways the writing of history has been shaped by disparate ideals, values, web of relations and power. This course will revisit Hong Kong’s history through the exploration of narratives documenting women, a group often made invisible in history writing, as social actors in the fabric of colonial Hong Kong. From elites’ households to textile factories, from rural villages, western-district brothels to mid-levels convents, schools and hospitals, women of different generations have worked as caregivers, breadwinners, pioneers, and educators while contesting the prescribed subordinate status as objects of exploitation in a patriarchal society. Drawing from a wide range of sources, including archival documents, published biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, family histories, school histories, and oral histories, this course will seek to introduce a multi-faceted history of colonial Hong Kong with women as the focus of inquiry. The discussion of women’s narratives will be situated in respective historical contexts linking the personal to social, political and economic changes in Hong Kong under colonial rule. It will also discuss the use of auto/biographies and oral histories as a methodology in historical research investigating the relations between memory, self and identity.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by directly engaging in critical reflections that help students work towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).",

Institutions such as lineage and family, marriage, religion, medical practices, art, education and politics shape our life patterns as well as social mores. Gender, as one of the building blocks of society and culture, shapes our values and is deeply embedded in our daily lives, and it weaves an intricate ideological fabric that strongly impacts our thoughts, feelings and action.  Through the exploration of selected issues in Chinese culture which are significant and relevant to everyday life, this course introduces to students historical materials which relate to, and contemporary research on, the role of gender in the making of history and culture, and how history and culture work to shape our understanding of gender. As they participate in the learning activities of the course, students will be gradually led to understand Chinese culture from a new perspective. Furthermore, students will have a chance to reflect on long-held values and beliefs which they themselves have acquired as members of this culture, or which they witness in the daily life of the community around them. While helping students to further understand the Chinese culture and history in a new gendered perspective, this course resonates with the Sustanable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by United Nations, including SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Students reflect on their various values and concepts in daily life through this course, and become a global citizen with an open mind.",

      "description": "Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) are concepts that are increasingly discussed in different industries as well as wider society nowadays. Why has DEI gained increased attention? Why do more people and organizations pay attention to DEI? What is DEI and why does DEI matter? What are the different aspects of DEI in society? How do we move from exclusion to inclusion? When do we know DEI is not lip service? What happens when different ideas about DEI clash? Is DEI ‘political correctness’? This course will take you through an exploratory journey about aspiring to strive for being inclusive – it is an exploratory journey because there will be many unknowns and inconclusive answers. The course aims to pay attention to both theoretical concepts as well as what concrete actions can be done at different levels of society when we strive for DEI.",

      "course_syllabus": "Part 1: Why does DEI matter?\nPrivilege – Unmasking the invisible and taken-for-granted\nWho are we? It is a big and broad question. Also, there are so many social aspects that we embody that we may have taken for granted. In this class, we will use a few examples to talk about what is privilege. We will try to unmask certain privileges we embody, although we may not have recognized them before. This class can be emotionally challenging for us to reflect on our social positions in society.\nDifferent forms of negative treatment: Direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, microagression and unconscious bias\nWhy do stereotypes and differential treatment exist? What social functions do they serve? What are the forms of negative treatment in society?\nConsequences of negative treatment: from personal to organizational to society\nWhat are the consequences of negative treatment, at the personal, organizational and societal levels? How may we explain increasing attention paid to DEI in the recent decade?\nGuest speaker sharing:\nThe business case for inclusion\nPart 2: Social differences\nAge – Is age a number?

We curate and deliver result-oriented content marketing and social media campaigns through integrated platforms, help brands penetrate and build relationship with “50+” consumer markets.’\nRace/ ethnicity – What assumptions do we hold of people who are of different races and ethnicities? How much do we understand sensitivities around different cultures and religions? What are some of the contemporary and historical debates about racism in different parts of the world?\nGuest speaker sharing:\n共融館\nKung Yung Koon-Shabnam.\nDisability – What are the differences between impairment and disabilities? What is the social model of disability? Why do some people use the term ‘contingently able bodied? What are the implications of living with visible and invisible disabilities?\nVisit:\nDignity Kitchen in Mongkok\nIts mission is to restore dignity to the differently- abled, and to leverage business tools to solve a deep-rooted issue this marginalised group faces: unemployment.

The guided tour may be led by an employee who had sight impairments, showcasing how a workplace can concretely take into account the individual needs of people living with different abilities, and make relevant changes to the design and infrastructure of the workplace.\nGender and family status – What are the many implications of the intersecting influences of gender and family status in the workplace? We will look at the examples of breastfeeding and caring responsibilities (parent-child and beyond) to understand the implications of family status in the workplace and some of the difficult debates that ensue.\nImpact of a breastfeeding-friendly workplace on an employed mother's intention to continue breastfeeding after returning to work, SY Tsai -\nBreastfeeding Medicine\n, 2013 - liebertpub.com\nGuest speaker sharing:\nHapperiod\nHapperiod is the first 1-stop online platform offering menstrual education and related products in Hong Kong.

What are the affirming behaviours at the interpersonal levels and organizational levels that transgender people welcome?\nSexual Orientation – Is sexual orientation something private? How does sexual orientation become an aspect that is subjected to much cultural, social and legal exclusion in many social domains?

      "description": "(UGEC3227 is double-coded with GDRS3021.)  This course critically explores the development of LGBTQI+ studies as an interdisciplinary field of inquiry. It traces how LGBTQI+ communities develop against the backdrops of social forces and social oppression. It analyzes the cultural, social and legal environments that LGBTQI+ people live with, in diverse spheres such as families, education, employment, health and the media. The discussions focus on both the structural constraints that LGBTQI+ people face, but also the agency and resilience they display. It explores the development of contemporary LGBTQI+ identities and social movements, as well as the politics involved. The course also asks how gender and sexual diversity is understood in different parts of the world in an era of globalization. Students are also exposed to different practices, policies and laws that are related to LGBTQI+ people’s lives.The Sustainable Development Goals vow to work towards a society where no one if left behind, particularly those who are most vulnerable and marginalized. In many parts of the world, LGBTQI+ people are historically amongst the most vulnerable and marginalized in society. This course will discuss the unequal treatment they face in cultural, social, political and legal systems and discuss how such inequality may be addressed.",

      "description": "(UGEC3225 is double-coded with GDRS3024.)  Educational and occupational accomplishments vary dramatically among individuals and profoundly affect lives. Importantly, gender is among the powerful individual characteristics that affect people's experiences in educational and work settings. Gender shapes youths' experience and outcomes of education across the globe and across history. This course is designed to introduce to students, with a critical mindset, important contemporary issues at the intersection of gender, education and jobs. The topics address the role of gender in school- and related preferences and achievements, with a focus on social and cognitive approaches. For example, what is quality education (SDG goal 4) and why is it important to evaluate it with a gender perspective? Do men and women really differ in their abilities, and if so, by how much? Is personal interest a better explanation of gender imbalances in occupations? What are the ways that biases exist in education and the workplace, and how do teachers, parents, and employers contribute to gender biases (SDG goal 5)? Can gender equality in performance and hiring be improved by removing stereotypes? The literature will cover childhood, adolescence as well as adulthood in order to provide insight into the age-related changes of the gender issues. Particular attention will be paid to issues that relate closely to daily life, both local and international. Empirical evidence will be reviewed to illustrate the gender biases and substantiate the explanatory theories. Potential interventions to address gender biases in education and the workplace will also be discussed.",

      "course_syllabus": "This course is designed to introduce to students, with a critical mindset, important contemporary issues at the\nintersection of gender and education and achievement. Collectively, the topics address the gender-education nexus in academic, occupational, and social domains from childhood through adulthood. We will pay particular attention to issues that relate closely to daily life, both local and international. Theories and data will be drawn mainly from Psychology but will also come from other disciplines.\nIn terms of SDGs, the course is most relevant for goal #4 (Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education) and goal #5 (Achieve gender equality and empower the marginalised gender).\nMajor concepts and topics:\n1. \nQuality education and equitable workplace\nOpen discussion and review impressions on education and occupational contexts locally and internationally to assess if our current education is inclusive and equitable, and if gender equality and marginalization of gender are still pertinent questions in our society.\nWhy is it important to achieve gender equality and empower the marginalized gender?\n2. \nGender differences and similarities in educational and occupational achievement\nThis topic includes questions such as: Gender differences is a topic that has fascinated researchers and is a topic of daily conversation. Do men/boys really differ from women/girls, and how? How big are the differences? Does it depend on contexts?\n3. \nGender-related academic and occupational interests and goals\nSome argue that the gender gaps in academic and occupational outcomes may not be entirely the result of differences in ability or prejudice, but differences in the interests and goals of men/boys and women/girls. Are there gender differences in what people prefer as study subjects and occupations? What do men and women look for in their jobs?\n4. \nGender socialization in schools\nIn modern society, we spend almost ¼ of our life attending school. While a lot of gender socialization occurs at home, the school is also an important ground for gender socialization. What messages do schools and teachers send to students? How does sexism occur at schools and what interventions have been tested?\n5. \nGender segregation at schools: The case of single-sex education\nSingle-sex schools exist in many countries over the globe. However, few may notice that such institutional segregation of gender in the context of education has been a matter of intense social and scientific debate in the West. What are the rationales for the setting up of single-sex education? Do they live up to the tests of scientific studies? What are the possible consequences of gender segregation at schools?\n6. \nMotivation, stereotypes and engagement: Does gender matter?\nOn the personal level, various psychological mechanisms may be at work to produce gender differences in educational and occupational achievement. What are some of these mechanisms? For example, how does s\ntereotype threat and self efficacy theories apply to create gendered phenomena to make education inequitable?\n7. \nGender biases in the workplace\nWomen’s status in the workplace has improved drastically over the decades. However, have we gotten rid of gender biases in the workplace? What are some of the ways that gender biases manifest in today’s workplace, personally or institutionally, explicitly or implicitly?\n8. \nInterventions to address gender gaps in the workplace\nIf gender gaps still exist in the workplace, what can be done about it? For example, what interventions may be effective in narrowing the gender gap in STEM participation? Many companies have adopted a quota policy to increase their representation of women. What have research shown about the impact of having more women or just more diversity in groups?\nThe teaching and learning approach will be a mix of teacher-guided and student-centred activities. Lectures will introduce the background knowledge of each topic and review the required readings. Then, students will be engaged in active group discussions. Before class, students have to post intellectual questions concerning the assigned readings. They will also look for additional discussion materials (academic articles, news reports, blog posts, etc.) and share them in class during discussions and presentations. The teacher and tutor(s) will monitor and guide the discussions. Towards the end of the course, students will present a poster on a self-selected topic related to gender and education/achievement in a mini-conference, and write an essay on the same topic to conclude their learned knowledge and demonstrate their ability to critically analyse the topic.",

      "description": "(UGEC3213 is double-coded with GDRS3025.) This course examines the gender dimensions of innovation and novelty. The key questions are: How/Why/What/When innovation(s) are gendered? We will discuss the fluidity and messiness of doing and undoing gender in innovation practices and meanings produced. Broadly defined, innovation refers to new ideas, new knowledge, new technologies, new designs, and creative practices with the goal to solve social or technical problems. Many innovations may seem gender-neutral but are inherently imbued with gender perceptions. The course will equip students with ways to apply gender analysis to decipher innovations and innovative processes. The course incorporates sustainable development goals (SDGs) on Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities to become more discerning toward more sustainable practices to advance Industry Innovation and Infrastructure. Using case studies from the technology culture, the routine practices, and the emergent new economy, students will learn to untangle how gender intersects with the seemingly neutral artefacts of innovation and technology. The course further covers how emergent issues of diversity and inclusion, AI and information technology, social entrepreneurship and social innovation, and leadership style could reshape the existing relationship between gender and innovation to advance sustainability and social resilience.",

      "course_syllabus": "Week 1: Introduction: When are Innovation(s) Gendered?\n·\nInnovations in science and technology often seemed gender-neutral, when do they become gendered?\n·\nTo innovate for a more sustainable future, having SDG goals in mind are important in any innovative ventures, and the course begins with the SDG goals on gender equality and reduced inequality to identify gaps in science and technology.\nWeek2: Doing and Undoing Gender in Innovation\n·\nWe will discuss the ways that gender analysis contributes to our understanding of\ninnovation.\n·\nEmbedding gender analysis in science research could help filter out inherent biases to\nfurther advance the innovative processes.\nWeek 3: Why/How is Innovation Gendered?\n·\nWhile debates about the gender dimensions of technology are many, has feminism\nchanged science? Why and how innovation is persistently gendered?\n·\nHow do scholars explain the gender gap in innovation?\nWeek 4: Gender and Technology\n·\nWe will discuss different feminist approaches to study the relationship between gender\nand technology and the ways to reduce gender inequality in the technology field.\nWeek 5: Gender/Sexuality in Science and Engineering Education\n·\nWe will discuss the ways that experiences in science and technology may contribute to\npersistent gender inequality. What are some ways to bridge this gap?\nWeek 6: Gender and STEM Career\n·\nWe will discuss how different identities play a great role in STEM career that may reproduce inequality.\nWeek 7: Science, Technology, and Medicine\n·\nWe will discuss how people infused gendered bias on scientific discovery and how\ngender and sexuality shape the use of new technologies in the field of science and medicine.\nWeek 8: Gender in Creative Industries\n·\nInnovation is not limited to science and technology. The emergent creative industries are\nalso the place for innovative practices to take shape. We will discuss how gender and the\ncreative industries are mutually shaped.\nWeek 9: Gender and Entrepreneurship\n·\nEntrepreneurship is understood as the process to start and launch a business and\nis an important part of innovative endeavors. Scholars have explored how the entrepreneurship\nprocess is inherently gendered.\nWeek 10: Gender, Social Entrepreneurship, and Social Innovation\n·\nSocial entrepreneurship and social innovation are an emergent field where cross-sectoral\nand interdisciplinary collaborations are encouraged to come up with better solutions to\ncomplex social problems. We will discuss how gender interacts with this emergent field.\nWeek 11: Sustainability, Diversity, and Inclusion\n·\nSustainability, diversity, and inclusion are currently widely incorporated in social\nentrepreneurship and social innovation. We will discuss how gender analysis could contribute to\nthese pillars.\n·\nHow do these pillars support and incubate innovation for sustainable development? (SDG Goal 9 on building resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation)\nWeek 12: (En)Gendering Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Leadership I\n·\nWe will discuss how gender-sensitive leadership could help engender innovation and\nentrepreneurship.\nWeek 13: (En)Gendering Innovation, Intrapreneurship, and Leadership II\n·\nWhat if the changes in gender and innovation need to happen from within an organization? We\nwill discuss how intrapreneurship could reshape gender relations within the organization and\nprovide the ground for gender-sensitive innovation.\n·\nintrapreneurial leaders are key actors to advance cross-sectoral innovation and knowledge creation\nfor a sustainable future. We will revisit the SDGs and think about how to integrate them into the science and technology fields.",

      "description": "(UGEC3214 is double-coded with GDRS3026.) This course examines the rich tradition of feminist film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates. Topics will include the key semiotic and psychoanalytic approaches of the 1970s-1990s, classic films which have inspired feminist debate, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, independent cinema, and postmodern cinema, as well as recent cinematic re-conceptualizations and exploration of gender and sexuality local and abroad. In systems of representation from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, women have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object “to-be-looked-at,” in Laura Mulvey’s now often quoted words. Following her trail, feminist critics turned their attention to mainstream films and popular media addressed to female spectators and exposed the contradictions within and between the notion of “women’s pictures” and the diversity of female experience. Local cinemas and independent creators also tell their own unique stories of women’s lives in dramatically different cultural contexts. Critics from other fields further complicate these images by examining them through lens including race, class, ability, queerness, and more.Mulvey’s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the place of women as spectacle or passive object in films “cut to the measure of [male] desire.” Critics around the world showed how different groups of women attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. What happens when female-identified artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? This course starts with the paradigm of narrative film analysis that Mulvey outlined in the 1970s and move on to explore a wider range of questions in feminist film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, (g)local cinema, and new feminist media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by female filmmakers worldwide, special focus will be placed onto important works in Hong Kong cinema for critical examination and comparative studies. Through critical reflections on notions such as gender stereotypes, representation, power, diversity, and equality, the course engages directly with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).",

      "description": "(UGEC3215 is double-coded with GDRS3214.)  How do we understand the notion of “minority”? And how does “minority”, look like, in cinema? This course examines the rich tradition of critical film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates, concerning “minority” identities and subalternity. Addressing key discussions about media representations of “minority”, the course will look at the politics of representation and its impacts, both on- and off-screen. We will be looking at how media works to construct “the Other” in different contexts, and delve into important work which have inspired minority cinema, subaltern cinema, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, and independent cinema among other counter-movements, as well as recent re-conceptualizations and exploration of representations marginalized identities, positions, and experiences, local and abroad. Across different systems of representation, from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, different groups, especially marginalized ones with little access to the mechanisms of production, have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object “to-be-looked-at,” in critical film theorist Laura Mulvey’s now often quoted words. Lacking representations both behind the camera and in front of it, how are the lives of different social “minorities” affected by biased media representations? How are stereotypes and biases created, disseminated, perpetuated, and reproduced through media, and to what consequences? Mulvey’s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the standings of different socially and culturally marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities, queer communities, and people with disabilities, etc., as spectacle or passive object “in films cut to the measure of desire” of the dominant social groups.What happens when “minority” artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? Critics showed how different marginalized groups around the world attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. Minority cinemas and independent creators have been actively carving out space to tell their own unique stories of lives at the margin in dramatically different cultural contexts, and these images are further complicated by engagements with them through the intersecting lens including ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, ability, queerness, and more.In the course, we will look at how socially marginalized groups, such as gay and lesbians, transgender persons, ethnic minorities, women in different stages of their lives, people with mental illness, teenagers, the elderlyand many others are portrayed, and seek to expand their on-screen existence in Hong Kong media. In the exploration, we will engage with key questions in critical film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, systems of media production, pro-sumer culture, (g)local cinema, alternative cinema, and new media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by “minority” filmmakers and media creators worldwide, and important cinematic and media movements that challenge the status-quo. Special focus will be placed onto important works in Hong Kong and Asia for critical examination and comparative studies. Through critical exercise and reflection on notions such as power, diversity, equality, and freedom, the course aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).",

      "description": "Words can keep one another at arm’s length, while bringing people together. This paradoxical nature, coupled with the fact that we cannot not communicate, makes our interpersonal lives moderately challenging and, more often than not, a source of joy, fulfillment, and connection, as well as frustration, unhappiness, and even conflict. In the 1960s, having witnessed humanity's capacity for both violence and care, clinical psychologist Marshall Rosenberg sought to develop Compassionate communication (also known as Nonviolent communication) to foster love, truth, and courage. This model enables people to stay connected with themselves and others by identifying and expressing their underlying basic needs, even during times of conflict. Not only does Compassionate communication nurture connection, but it also provides various tools to shift the mode of influence from power-over to power-with in collaborative settings, contributing to a peaceful and inclusive future. In fact, Compassionate communication has been recognized by UNESCO as one of the best practices for nonviolent conflict resolution in both formal and informal education worldwide. As working with people from diverse backgrounds becomes increasingly common, the ability to communicate across differences is essential. This course will cover all the essential concepts, processes, and skills of Compassionate communication for both personal and social life. Through interactive learning in the form of role plays, demonstrations, and real-life scenarios, the course will cultivate students' awareness of their needs and their ability to authentically express themselves. Students will learn to listen with empathy, make life-enriching requests, apologize without self-blame, navigate conflict, hold difficult conversations, and facilitate collaboration across differences.",

Confidence and ease in authentic self-expression with care, orienting to others’ experiences with empathy, making life-enriching requests without demands, and navigating difficult conversations and conflicts with a collaborative mindset.\n4. Openness and curiosity toward differences, along with a skill set for collaborating with people from various backgrounds.",
      "course_syllabus": "CLASS 1: The Basics of Compassionate Communication (I)\nThis lecture introduces how and why clinical psychologist Marshall Rosenberg developed Compassionate Communication (also known as Nonviolent Communication, NVC) in the 1960s and outlines its key premises. It contrasts three common types of communication— dialogue, debate, and persuasion—and characterises Compassionate Communication as a language modality that fosters dialogue. Additionally, it identifies four common language patterns that hinder connection and understanding.\nCLASS 2: The Basics of Compassionate Communication (II)\nThere are four components of Compassionate Communication that enhance connection and clarity: observation, feelings, needs, and requests. This session will guide students in making clear distinctions between observations and evaluations, feelings and thoughts, needs and strategies, and requests and demands. Additionally, it will help students cultivate their “needs consciousness”, serving as a foundation for empathetic listening.\nCLASS 3: The Power of Empathetic Listening\nEmpathetic listening goes beyond the mechanics of hearing words; it involves immersing oneself in the speaker's emotional landscape, understanding their feelings and needs, and responding with genuine care and understanding. In this session, participants will learn to distinguish empathetic from non-empathetic responses listening, and the power of empathetic listening in transforming conflict to connection.\nCLASS 4: Practicing Empathetic Listening\nTuning into the inner world of another person is a skill that requires refinement through repeated practice. This session will provide students with four easy-to-follow frameworks for listening to others with empathy. It will also offer important advice on making empathetic guesses more colloquial and natural in daily conversations. In empathetic responses, we often ask questions to gain a deeper understanding of the other person's experience. This session will distinguish between the types of questions that strengthen connection and those that do not.\nCLASS 5: Making Life-Fulfilling Requests\nThis week's topic focuses on making requests in Compassionate Communication, highlighting our interdependence in meeting needs through others. While making requests can feel daunting, the course examines how they invite contributions to our happiness and addresses challenges like fear of rejection and underestimating others' willingness to comply. We will explore barriers to making fulfilling requests and share strategies for clear communication to improve positive responses. The session will also cover handling unmet requests and understanding the needs behind a \"no.\" The goal is to help participants feel more comfortable asking for what they need while remaining open to any outcome.\nCLASS 6: Expressing Appreciation and Making Apologies Without Self-Blame\nExpressing appreciation is often recommended by relationship coaches as a relational lubricant. However, through the lens of Compassionate Communication, our usual way of expressing appreciation can sometimes take the form of judgment, even if it’s positive. The issue with judgment—positive or negative—is its static language, which can cast others, and even ourselves, in stone. For example, saying “You are so generous” provides no context about what actions led to that acknowledgement or which needs were met. Similarly, apologies like “I’m wrong” or “I’m sorry” can also be seen as judgments that foster self-blame and diminish self-confidence. This lecture will explore how to express appreciation using action-oriented language and how to make apologies without self-blame while fully acknowledging our impact on others.\nCLASS 7: Troubleshooting: Clearing What Stands in the Way of Using Compassionate Communication\nFailure teaches success. In this lesson, we will address frequently asked questions and common pitfalls encountered on the journey of learning and practising Compassionate Communication. Understanding the challenges we face can transform setbacks into valuable learning experiences. We encourage you to engage actively by asking any questions related to communication and its daily-life applications. Together, we’ll explore strategies to navigate these challenges, enhancing both your understanding and practical skills in Compassionate Communication. Your inquiries will help deepen our discussion and foster a supportive learning environment.\nCLASS 8: Navigating Cultural Differences in Communication Styles\nThis week’s topic explores the intersection of culture and emotions within Compassionate Communication. We’ll examine how cultural backgrounds shape perceptions, expressions, and management of emotions, focusing on the differences between individualistic and collectivistic cultures. This session will discuss how cultures define ideal emotions, prioritise emotional expression or suppression, and the impact on mental and physical health. Additionally, we will consider how cultural perspectives influence emotional interpretation, whether through individual expression or situational context. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance our awareness of how culture affects emotional experiences and apply this understanding to our Compassionate Communication practice.\nCLASS 9: Dancing with Conflict (I): What and Why?\nConflict is an inevitable part of life, and while it can be intense and overwhelming, it also presents opportunities for growth and understanding. This week, we begin our exploration of conflict through the lens of Compassionate Communication. We will start by examining our own typical reactions to conflict and identifying our default modes of engagement. We will discuss how conflict arises from differing needs, values, and interpretations of situations, and how these differences can be opportunities to learn from each other. This lecture introduces the idea that all actions, including those that trigger conflict, are attempts to meet basic human needs. By understanding the underlying needs and values involved, we can begin to shift from blame and judgment to connection and resolution.\nCLASS 10: Dancing with Conflict (II): 9 Skills to Navigate Conflict\nBuilding on our understanding of conflict, this week we will explore the practical application of the \"9 Skills\" of Compassionate Communication developed by Jim and Jori Manske. These skills offer a framework for effectively navigating conflict, beginning with the vital \"Zero Step\" of being present and self-connected. We will emphasise the importance of self-empathy in managing reactions and remaining grounded. The lecture will cover inviting others into dialogue, creating a safe space, expressing ourselves honestly, listening with empathy, making clear requests, and acknowledging different perspectives. We will also discuss using gratitude, feedback, and confirmation to enhance communication and understanding. By applying these skills to past conflicts, we aim to build stronger relationships and navigate difficult conversations. Ultimately, the focus will be on gaining confidence in using these skills in daily life for more compassionate and effective interactions.\nCLASS 11: How to Have Difficult Conversations?\nWe will explore four responses to disagreements: 1) blaming others, 2) blaming ourselves, 3) practising self-empathy, and 4) empathising with others. Each response will be detailed, and practical exercises will reinforce our understanding. We will also identify factors that contribute to challenging conversations, such as differences in positional and status power. Additionally, we will analyse the impact of holding an \"Enemy Image\" of others and how to transform this perspective through Compassionate Communication principles. Intimate relationships can bring both joy and pain, often prompting us to recreate bonds we had with caregivers or compensate for unmet needs. In these relationships, we learn to express our needs while respecting our partner's boundaries. This session will provide valuable tips from Compassionate Communication for every stage of romance—whether it’s attraction, navigating power struggles, commitment, or even breaking up. By understanding our responses and improving our communication skills, we can foster healthier, more fulfilling relationships.\nCLASS 12: Collaborating Across Differences: Compassionate Communication for Team Work\nCollaboration is widely regarded as an essential means and a long-cherished goal across various settings. In this session, we will explore the roles and types of facilitation, along with practical facilitation skills to enhance our collaborative efforts. We will guide you through the process of designing a meeting, including setting a clear purpose and desired outcomes, as well as selecting appropriate processes. Additionally, we will have a brief discussion on alternative decision-making systems beyond majority rule, which are more likely to address basic needs without creating opposition.\nCLASS 13: Harvesting Co-Learning Experience",

It demonstrates how gender challenges mainstream historical analysis and explanations. The focus is placed on the changing meanings and practices of femininity/masculinity across time. Issues such as gender transgression, homosocial relationships, marriage, sexuality and reproduction will be explored, both to shed light on, and to question our familiar perceptions of China. By examining the interaction between historical context and gender politics, this course also provokes reflections on methodologies, sources and discourses.",

      "description": "The course will examine the relationship between the development of gender and sexual identities and that of the contemporary politics mainly in, but not limited to, Asian societies. We will look into how the contemporary politics and gender structures in the regions interplay and produce racial identities through the lens of gender. For example, the Korean-Japan and China-Japan dispute over issues of comfort women in World War II; Gender activism in Gaza and Arab Spring, the female suicide bombers in middle-East, and religious right-wing movements in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Students will learn how to examine the issues of gender and sexual identities and how they are deeply embedded within the global politics as well as local social mores. Specifically, the course is divided into two parts. First of all, we will review the key theories of citizenship, war, democracy, nationalism, human rights and so on – through the lens of gender. Students are expected to learn the core theoretical debates and methods through reading key texts. The second part of this course will analyze these theories and debates through cutting-edge case studies. Topics will include comfort women, sexual violence in war, terrorism, female suicide-bombers and right-wing religious movements, human trafficking, grassroots feminist organizations, anti-war activism and so on. Students are expected to establish a more solid and critical range of views to examine these global issues and political controversies.",

Before the start of the second year, the student is expected to have completed a three-month supervised internship in an NGO or a university-affiliated unit which is involved with gender-related services or advocacy work. Before the internship starts, the student will prepare her/his proposal, outlining the objectives of her internship, and the theoretical knowledge or insights it rests on. Finally, a final report will be submitted, in which the student demonstrates her/his depth of reflection on her/his field experience, as well as the extent to which theory and practice can be integrated. The student’s performance will be evaluated on the basis of his/her final report and the partnering organization’s assessment.",

      "credits": "3.00",
      "terms": [],
      "description": "The course will investigate contemporary women’s transnational migration from developing countries to newly developed countries in Asia and beyond. We will look at Filipina, Vietnamese and Chinese women migrating to Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the United States for marriage and employment. We will discuss issues related to labor and marriage migrations, as well as trafficking in women, on both macro- and micro-levels. We are going to ask: how does the global economic restructuring shape the gendered migration today? What makes female labor different from male labor in the global labor market? What are push-and-pull factors that trigger these women to leave their hometown to be workers or wives in foreign countries? What difficulties do they experience after entering host societies and what impact would the migration flow bring to both laborer/bride receiving and sending countries? Moreover, we will explore the global market formation of transnational commodified marriages between women from developing countries and men from more developed countries. Taking the matchmaking industry in Taiwan and Vietnam for example, we will ask: how should we perceive the subjectivity of women who marry abroad through brokers? How could we challenge the assumption that the brokerage business in transnational marriage is part of human trafficking practice, and women involved in this activity are victims? To better address this issue, we may also need to address the question: what is trafficking in women? How are women represented in the global anti-trafficking campaign and how the politics of charity influences the state’s immigration policymaking and women’s transnational mobility? We will approach these issues from a critical perspective in order to challenge given social perception that ignores women's agency at work. Throughout the semester, we will read theoretical and empirical works from many disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, political economy and women's studies. In addition, we will read primary source materials including news reports, online forums and watch documentaries and film clips.",

This film examines the motivations of two agency heads and follows several of these women as they seek a brighter future."

      "description": "Humans all over the world are inevitably gendered, either voluntarily or involuntarily, in tangible behavior and in perception, from birth to death.Indeed, it is difficult to identify an aspect of human existence, be it ability, health, preferences, beliefs or opportunities,that does not have some flavor of gender. These gender phenomena do not arise from nowhere in adulthood but can be traced from childhood following a complex interplay of social, cognitive, and biological processes. They manifest in rich forms at various points of development. This course tackles the study of gender from a human developmental perspective, with the aim of understanding how gender phenomena arise, develop and change from infancy to older age, how they can be described and how to explain them with an eclectic theoretical approach that balances various developmental forces. The course also emphasizes an understanding of the methodology in empirical studies of age-related changes and causes and consequences of behaviours. Students are expected to engage actively in the identification and analysis of the relevant issues in real life, both of others and their own. At the end of the course, students will gain a critical understand of the role of gender in shaping human development, gain insight into what has led them to become who they are, and be more informed about how to deal with gender phenomena constructively at various life stages.",

      "description": "“Gender” is not only a social category but also a perspective of seeing the world. As a discipline, gender studies draws on a variety of knowledge in humanities and social science and shapes its methodology and methods to challenge existing hegemonic knowledge that is considered being produced scientifically. The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the intellectual debate between feminist epistemology and scientific knowledge production as well as to equip them with the abilities of critical thinking about their methodologies and conducting research with proper methods. Topics include: 1) critical questioning of the validity of knowledge production, the power relations between the researcher and his or her research subjects, and the representation of the research and the researcher; 2) cautiously examining the influence of globalization on feminist research and the intersectionality among race, class and gender; and 3) innovatively connecting theory with praxis through participatory action and writing. We will begin with a brief introduction to the history and development of feminist research, followed by discussions on feminist methodologies by exemplary researchers. In the final weeks, we will shift our focus to the application of theory and groundbreaking feminist writing through collaboration. To make sure students are capable of conducting their own research using a feminist framework, this course also requests students to conduct a mini study and engage in narrative analyses. After taking this course, students are expected to be familiar with feminist approaches of conducting research and able to reflect on the knowledge production of their own research in the future.",

      "description": "This course is for those who aspire to social justice but are short of skills and consciousness. Drawing on feminist and critical theories, and Nonviolent Communication, the course will explore the myths of human nature that stand in the way of a large-scale and sustainable social transformation, and discuss the dynamism between gender, feminisms and civil society. The first four lectures will lay a theoretical foundation that cultivates a need-based perspective, weaving the gap between the personal and the social. On that basis, the course will examine how feminist-inspired campaigns intervene into social issues of significance to contemporary world, namely space, body politics, neoliberalism, and institutional reform. Alternative practices such as restorative justice, shared economy, ecovillages and intentional communities, new ways of governance such as Holacracy and Sociocracy will be introduced.",

      "description": "This course looks at the critical sites of gender/sexuality formations in different societies and the many meanings of gender/sexuality in globalized cultures by drawing on a cross-cultural perspective and a comparative approach. In particular, this course brings a cross-disciplinary dialogue to the influences of diverse genders and sexualities on everyday life. It argues that although diverse genders and sexualities are seemingly ‘private decisions’, there are also lots of ‘public dialogues’ about them. The course examines the lives of LGBTQI+ people in diverse domains of life, such as employment, education, and health care, and analyzes some contemporary development in policy and practice. As a whole, the course calls for reflections on living with differences in contemporary society.",

      "description": "How is work different for men and women? Why does gender matter in shaping the experience of work? Beginning with these questions, this course explores the distinct positions of men and women in the workplace and in the labor markets and examines gender relationship, gender segregation and gender discrimination across a variety of research topics on farm work, factory work, migrant work, business, housework, service work, entertainment and leisure. We will be reading about, analyzing, and discussing diverse empirical studies on men and women as workers, homemakers, care workers, organizers, or entrepreneurs, which provide fresh ways to look at the relationship between gender and work. This course provides students with key concepts and theories about the gendered institutions of economic development, organization, migration, and culture. Based on lectures, class discussions, and analytical practices, this course will help students to be an independent thinker and educated reader of social issues from a gender perspective. Students are expected to acquire critical thinking and analytical skills to reflect on theories and research findings, and to evaluate social facts and trends with implications for education, policy interventions and public participation.",

The course puts a premium on feminist thoughts on the reproduction of gendered family. We’ll start with introduction to how family is formed in different cultural contexts, and then proceed to discuss how family and kinship can be redefined under the development of reproductive technology, transnational migration, and globalization. Topics will include familial formation in contemporary patrilineal/matrilineal societies, non-mainstream marriages like walking marriage and bride kidnapping practices, gendered division of labor in conducting housework, the social construction of motherhood, domestic violence, cohabitation, non-married family, single-parent family, gay family, surrogacy, and transnational adoption and so on.",

      "description": "The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the intellectual debate between feminist epistemology and scientific knowledge production as well as to equip them with the abilities of critical thinking about their methodologies and conducting research with proper methods. Topics include: 1) critically questioning the validity of knowledge production, the power relations between the researcher and his or her research subjects, and the representation of the research and the researcher; 2) cautiously examining the influence of globalization on feminist research and the intersectionality among race, class and gender; and 3) innovatively connecting theory with praxis through participatory action and writing. We will begin with a brief introduction to the history and development of feminist research, followed by discussions on feminist methodologies by exemplary researchers. In the final weeks, we will shift our focus to the application of theory and groundbreaking feminist writing through collaboration.",

      "course_syllabus": "1. Histories and the Development of Feminist Research\nHow did feminist research/gender studies become a discipline in the academia along with the development of feminist movements in the West?\n2. Feminist Knowledge Production\nHow is feminist epistemology different from conventional epistemology and how it criticizes androcentric knowledge production in natural and social sciences?\n3. Standpoint Theory\nWhat is women’s experience? How can women’s experience be the object of knowledge?\n4. The Politics of Location and Representation\nWhat are Third World feminism and post-colonial feminism? How do they respond to the mainstream feminism in the West?\n5. Intersectionality\nWhy is “intersectionality” important in gender studies? How does gender intersect with race, class, and etc.?\n6. Postmodernism, Globalization and Transnational Feminist Research\nHow could postmodernism influence feminist epistemology and methodology? How could we think globally and from the South?\n7. Research Methods in Gender Studies\nMajor research methods in social science will be covered, such as ethnography, interview, discursive analysis, focus group, oral history, and etc. Some reflection on traditional research methods in conducting social science research will also be introduced.\n8. Political and Ethical Issues\nSome important issues in conducting social science research will be discussed, including authenticity of the data, the power relationship between the researcher and the researched, and researcher’s reflexivity, ignorance, and emotions in the fieldwork.\n9. Feminist Writing Culture\nWhat is feminist writing? How does such writing challenge conventional androcentric writing but still guarantee the “objectivity” of research? Some conventional writing in social sciences and experimental writing in feminist research will be introduced.\n10. From Theory to Praxis\nTwo issues will be discussed: how to connect theory and practice and how to conduct collaborative research.",

      "description": "This course explores the distinct roles of Chinese women in social and economic development and examines the historical and regional diversities of women’s images based on various topics including work, family, organization, migration, culture and so on. Women have not only played an important role in various areas of economic activities, but also helped to shape family management, public participation, and consumption. This course points to a variety of women's living and working conditions in China, as well as their experiences of social changes brought about by patriarchal traditions, socialist rules, market reforms, and changing policies of family planning and migration. As a result, Chinese women have appeared in various research traditions differently as iron girls, laid-off workers, working sisters, left-behind women, flower vase, housewives, dama and so on. Based on lectures, class discussions, and analytical practices, this course will help students to be an independent thinker of ideological shifts, policy changes, and social transformations from a gender perspective. Students are expected to acquire critical thinking and analytical skills to reflect on theories and research findings on work ethics, urban-rural divide, family relationship, intimacy and romance, and consumerism.",
