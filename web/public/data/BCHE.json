Summer Interns (including DREAM) may take this course but a local supervisor or supervisor from Biochemistry Program has to be assigned in addition to the internship supervisor for marking. Title of the project report must be different from other courses.\n\nDuration (study period):\nStudents taking this course usually start their experiments in the summer or early at term start and complete the project with a report written for marking by the end of first term. Deadline of submission of report is at term end. Two markers (including the supervisor and an extra marker is needed for dual supervisors) will evaluate the report (assessment form attached).\n\nJob nature:Students may hold a project on testing and purification of a biomolecule, cloning of a gene, detection of a gene mutation, performing PCR assay or ELISA assay, purification of a recombinant protein, developing an assay from modified protocols, doing literature search of patents and help filing a patent application in a patent law firm, doing data mining (In Silico analyses) or sequence analyses, testing of a drug, etc.\n\nReport for evaluation:\n1. The report should include a cover page with the title of the research, followed with a one page abstract (< 250 words), an introduction, materials and methods, results and discussion, acknowledgement, and references.\n2. Rationale of the study and background information should be covered in the introduction with some literature review and justification of why you are working on this project (importance of the project). Carefully explain the procedure of the experiments and technical details of how the assay is carried out in the section of materials and methods. After presenting the results and discuss the meaning of the results, explain briefly what could be done next or what could have been done better to obtain better results.\n3. Explain the limitations of the present study. At the end, a conclusion has to be made in the discussion part to end the report.\n4. Usually, 3-5 figures and tables should be enough for such a short report of around 30 pages with word count < 6,000. Students may consider follow the journal format of Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications.\n\nWho should take this course:\nAll Biochemistry majors are welcome to take this course which is an elective course (group C). For those who have participated the DREAM program, any research projects in local government departments or biotech company and those who joined a law firm for internship with literature (patent) research are also welcome to join this course as well.",

      "course_syllabus": "Fluorescence Techniques: Because of its outstanding sensitivity, reliability, non-invasiveness and friendliness to our environment, detection of target molecules by using fluorescence has been a common technology for various types of biochemical and biomedical studies. This session attempts to introduce to students different fluorescence techniques including the use of fluorometer, fluorescence plate reader, confocal microscope, and flow cytometer for a number of biochemical analyses.\n\nIon Exchange Chromatography: Chromatography is a technique which depends on the distribution of a molecule between two different phases, a stationary phase and a mobile phase. Depending on the stationary phase used, there are different kinds of chromatography which allow for separation of molecules with different properties. In the experiment, ion exchange chromatography will be used to separate three different proteins.\n\nSodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Discontinuous Gel Electrophoresis: SDS is an anionic detergent which binds strongly to protein at a constant ratio such that all the SDS-treated proteins are negatively charged. Besides having the same charge to mass ratio, the SDS-treated proteins also have the same shape. Consequently, when electrophoresed in the molecular sieving polyacrylamide gel, they will be separated according to size and their molecular weight can be determined with reference to the standards.\n\nSeparation of Sub-cellular Components by Differential Centrifugation: Differential centrifugation will be used to separate sub-cellular components for biochemical analysis. Different sub-cellular components, such as the nucleus and the cell membrane, have different sedimentation properties and therefore, they can be differentially sedimented to the bottom of the centrifuge tube. In this experiment, we will attempt to separate key cellular components (the nucleus, the mitochondria/membrane and the cytosol fractions) using a simple centrifuge. The experiment was designed to show that by varying the parameters of centrifugation, one could selectively separate cellular components into fractions with distinctive biochemical characteristics.\n\nCrystallization of Lysozyme: The X-ray crystallography is a very important technique to study the three-dimensional structure of proteins. A good X-ray diffraction pattern, however, requires a large protein crystal that is free of contaminants and aggregation. In this experiment, students will acquire the basic skills of producing a crystal of lysozyme. In addition, the effects of different protein and salt concentrations on lysozyme crystallization will also be investigated.\n\n熒光技術：由於其出色的靈敏度，可靠性和非侵入性，通過使用熒光檢測目標分子一直是各類生物化學和生物醫學研究通用的技術。實驗會介紹不同的熒光技術，包括使用的熒光機，熒光微孔板檢測儀，激光共聚焦顯微鏡，流式細胞儀等等。\n\n離子交換層析：層析是一種依賴分子在固定相和流動相之間分佈的技術。利用不同的固定相，可以將具有不同性質的分子分離。在實驗中，學生將會利用離子交換層析法分離三種不同的蛋白質。\n\n十二烷基硫酸鈉 - 聚丙烯酰胺凝膠電泳：十二烷基硫酸鈉能與蛋白質透過一個恆定的比率結合，使得所有經處理的蛋白都帶相應的負電荷。因此，在分子篩聚丙烯酰胺凝膠電泳時，蛋白將根據大小有不同的電泳速度。透過與標準蛋白的比較，可以計算出蛋白的分子量。\n\n差速離心分離：實驗將利用差速離心分離亞細胞的不同部分。不同的細胞部分，如細胞核和細胞膜，具有不同的沉降性，因此，它們可以透過差異沉降到離心管的底部。這個實驗的目的是要顯示通過改變離心分離的參數，我們可以選擇性地分離出各種具鮮明生化特性的細胞部分。\n\n溶菌酶的結晶：X-射線晶體學是研究蛋白質三維結構一個非常重要的技術。然而一個理想的X-射線衍射圖案，需要一個大的蛋白質晶體。在實驗中，學生將學會生產溶菌酶的晶體。此外，亦會探討不同的蛋白濃度和鹽濃度對結晶的影響。\n\n荧光技术：由于其出色的灵敏度，可靠性和非侵入性，通过使用荧光检测目标分子一直是各类生物化学和生物医学研究通用的技术。实验会介绍不同的荧光技术，包括使用的荧光机，荧光微孔板检测仪，激光共聚焦显微镜，流式细胞仪等等。\n\n离子交换层析：层析是一种依赖分子在固定相和流动相之间分布的技术。利用不同的固定相，可以将具有不同性质的分子分离。在实验中，学生将会利用离子交换层析法分离三种不同的蛋白质。\n\n十二烷基硫酸钠 - 聚丙烯酰胺凝胶电泳：十二烷基硫酸钠能与蛋白质透过一个恒定的比率结合，使得所有经处理的蛋白都带相应的负电荷。因此，在分子筛聚丙烯酰胺凝胶电泳时，蛋白将根据大小有不同的电泳速度。透过与标准蛋白的比较，可以计算出蛋白的分子量。\n\n差速离心分离：实验将利用差速离心分离亚细胞的不同部分。不同的细胞部分，如细胞核和细胞膜，具有不同的沉降性，因此，它们可以透过差异沉降到离心管的底部。这个实验的目的是要显示通过改变离心分离的参数，我们可以选择性地分离出各种具鲜明生化特性的细胞部分。\n\n溶菌酶的结晶：X-射线晶体学是研究蛋白质三维结构一个非常重要的技术。然而一个理想的X-射线衍射图案，需要一个大的蛋白质晶体。在实验中，学生将学会生产溶菌酶的晶体能。此外，亦会探讨不同的蛋白浓度和盐浓度对结晶的影响。",

Students will learn how to observe, collect, analyze and evaluate evidence found at crime scenes. The first part addresses the identification of biological fluids such as blood, semen, and saliva from crime scene. The emphasis will be on the biochemical technologies used in the presumptive and confirmatory tests. The second part covers DNA analysis using RFLP and PCR-STR typing methods, interpretation of DNA typing results, and court presentation of such biological evidence. Mitochondrial DNA typing and Y chromosome DNA typing will also be discussed. It is anticipated that students will apply the biochemistry knowledge they have acquired in junior years in the course. In addition to the core academic knowledge, various in-class activities will also be integrated for students to appreciate the importance and to apply the knowledge they have learnt in class.
