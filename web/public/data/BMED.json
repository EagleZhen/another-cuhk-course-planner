      "description": "Mathematical literacy is the knowledge and application of basic mathematics in daily life. Problem solving is one of the competencies needed for mathematics literacy. It is the centre of mathematics activities. One of the major aims of school mathematics education is to equip the next generations to be mathematically literate and have mathematical problem solving competency. This course aims to help develop students’ knowledge on mathematical literacy and theories about mathematical problem solving. It covers a wide range of topics related to this area, including: development of mathematical literacy for all through approaches of mathematical exploration, understanding, reasoning, and communication; development of mathematical problem solving abilities; and analysis of misconception and cognitive difficulties encountered in the development of mathematical skills and ability in students.",

Through different learning activities, student teachers will review different dimensions of secondary school mathematics curriculum, including algebra, geometry, statistics and calculus, from an advanced standpoint.

This course surveys selected current topics and trends affecting mathematics education. It aims to expand students’ horizons in frontier research and contemporary issues in mathematics education. The specific topics of this course vary from year to year, as chosen by the instructor. Topics and issues may include, but are not limited to: mathematics assessment, historical and cultural aspects of mathematics, cognitive and affective aspects of mathematics, mathematics teaching for disadvantaged groups and language issues in mathematics education. The goal of examining these selected topics is to empower students to become potential agents and leaders of curricular change in their future practice.",
