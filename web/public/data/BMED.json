At junior secondary school level, statistics is introduced in relation to real life applications. At higher grade levels, statistics is taught with more computational elements and their interpretations, and real-world experiences in probabilistic events are basis for developing a formal understanding of probability in mathematics. In this course, topics in probability and statistics in secondary school mathematics curriculum are analyzed from multiple perspectives, that is, in terms of the mathematics content knowledge, pedagogical approaches, and epistemological relationships between mathematical concepts involved. Emphasis is on the development of stochastic thinking among school students. Through different learning activities which include the implementation of available information technology resources, student teachers will develop their conceptual skills and frameworks for effective instructional design in these curriculum topics.",
