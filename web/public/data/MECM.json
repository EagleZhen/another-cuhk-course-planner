Major developmental theories/perspectives will be discussed, analyzed, and compared. The key issues that will be highlighted are concerned with developmental and learning mechanisms, domain-general and domain-specific development, and nature-nurture relationship. Reflecting upon relevant social policy and educational initiatives. The challenges will be analyzed of translating observations and theories of child development into child care and education practices at home and at school.",

      "description": "The role of sign mediation is regarded as essential in the development of higher psychological processes. In this course, you are invited to explore the rich varieties of signs and their role in the development of mind in early childhood. There are two key concerns in the course: (1) In what ways are meaning making and the development of mind related to children's experience with signs such as languages, mathematics, and visual and expressive arts? (2) How could learning activities be designed to facilitate the understanding, appropriation, and creation of signs? To deepen our understanding of the complexity involved, perspectives from semiotics and the cultural-historical activity theory would be introduced. Insights from research works on the relation between signs and thought, as well as the interaction between sign mediation and human mediation, the creation of the zone of proximal development, and the integration of signs in children's activities, would be drawn to inform the educational practice and the actual design of learning activities. Drawing from different sources of stimulations, we aim to arrive at rich possibilities of designing meaningful activities for facilitating the early development of human mind.",
