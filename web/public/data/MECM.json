It is to emphasize that leadership and management are of paramount importance to the success of any organization, including ECE institutions. It is leadership and management that make organizations efficient and effective. This course blends the theoretical concepts of leadership and management with practice, enabling the participants to refine and improve their practice. By the end of the course, students will be familiar with a number of theories and perspectives of leadership and management; be able to critically analyze different perspectives and theories; have developed a position on what they believe ‘good’ leadership and management entailed in Hong Kong schools in general, and more specifically within their workplace context; and be able to discuss the various educational leadership and management issues in Hong Kong schools and their relationship with educational reform.",

      "description": "The role of sign mediation is regarded as essential in the development of higher psychological processes. In this course, you are invited to explore the rich varieties of signs and their role in the development of mind in early childhood. There are two key concerns in the course: (1) In what ways are meaning making and the development of mind related to children's experience with signs such as languages, mathematics, and visual and expressive arts? (2) How could learning activities be designed to facilitate the understanding, appropriation, and creation of signs? To deepen our understanding of the complexity involved, perspectives from semiotics and the cultural-historical activity theory would be introduced. Insights from research works on the relation between signs and thought, as well as the interaction between sign mediation and human mediation, the creation of the zone of proximal development, and the integration of signs in children's activities, would be drawn to inform the educational practice and the actual design of learning activities. Drawing from different sources of stimulations, we aim to arrive at rich possibilities of designing meaningful activities for facilitating the early development of human mind.",
