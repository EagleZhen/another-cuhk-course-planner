More advanced methods, such as systematic reviews and meta-analysis, will also be introduced. After completing the course, students will be able to complete data entry, cleaning/coding, select the appropriate analytical methods and conduct analyses independently. Students will also be equipped with the basic skills to present the analyzed data in different modes (e.g., scientific writing, poster presentation, and verbal presentations). Students are expected to possess basic knowledge in research methods within the field of sports science and physical activity, and basic computer skills, prior to taking this course.",

Physical fitness assessment is an indispensable part of an athletes training regimen. Hence, periodical assessment and evaluation of one's physical fitness level, becomes a fundamental part in maintaining and evaluating one's health. Knowledge, skill and the ability to conduct advanced fitness testing are essential requirements for most sports science research. This course is designed to enhance students' understanding of current trends in physical fitness evaluation, as well as to ascertain the skills and abilities needed to conduct advanced fitness testing. Subject matter related to theories, rationales, laboratory skills, and measurement techniques in current health and fitness evaluation will be discussed. This course is particularly useful for postgraduate students, as it will provide the fundamental and advanced knowledge and competency needed for their future health-related research projects.

However, in order to provide an effective exercise program, exercise prescriptions must be individualized and specific to the participant's unique health conditions. As chronic illnesses, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and lower-back disorder, become increasingly prevalent in modern urban settings, exercise prescriptions for the general population should be modified in order to cater to the specific medical indications of specific populations. Given that a regular exercise training program is recognized as good preventative medicine for chronic diseases, this course is designed to introduce information about specialized exercise prescription to meet the needs of general citizens and people with particular medical conditions. Students will be expected to become familiar with exercise prescriptions for general healthy populations and to use this knowledge to design exercise programs for targeted populations with specific chronic diseases.",

Wearable technology, such as bracelets, adds a visual element to physical activities, thereby providing students with a digital representation of their activity levels. Furthermore, access to online resources enables physical educators to substantially expand what constitutes physical education. Numerous online instructional materials are available for different types of sports and physical activities that can be implemented in class, thereby providing students with a break from the norm. However, digital solutions go beyond merely enhancing the levels of student engagement and altering the curriculum by facilitating the extension of the educators’ influence outside the gymnasium and into the classroom.

      "description": "With the rapid development of global economies and technology, modern information technology has been entering the field of sports and physical activity. At present, within international and domestic sports organizations and management structures, supporting athletes training through the use of sports specific equipment, research and development facilities, sports information networks and sports utility software applications have become commonplace and indispensable. This course will examine the professional needs of practitioners involved in using digital technologies and their applications within the sport, exercise and health contexts. A key element of this course will be to develop a deeper understanding of recent emerging technologies that can aid with improving health from clinical devices to active lifestyle aids, how they are developed, how they can be used and how to utilise them in research and practice. Maximising the usage of IT for the advancements of various disciplines within the Sports Science sector will be involved in this course, investigating issues such as Motion Analysis of Human Movement, Sports Biomechanics and the use of Big Data metrics in assessing performance, both during competition and in training. The use of biomedical software in monitoring every movement in an athlete’s or individual’s kinetic chain - their muscles and joints, so as to fine-tune technique for performance/health/safety enhancement will also be examined.",

      "description": "The course of Professional Attachment is designed to exposure students to their professional role by completing hours of field experience and a specialized project in the actual setting of sports science industry and physical activity. Such experience is important for clarifying and broadening career goals. Through practical attachment students would be provided opportunity to apply what the students learned from the programme into a real industry setting; to extend and deepen the knowledge gained from the programme; to conduct critical analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of knowledge; and to develop skills and values that acquired both in the classroom and the practicum. The essence of the course is to put theory into practice. Due to the nature of application students are required to complete at least 12 credits of course work. Students enrolled in the attachment will continue their other course works in the regular terms, and could simultaneously engage in practical attachment at any time during the course of the MSc study, with mutual agreement between the course supervisor and the field tutor. Opportunity and selection of the interested industry can be initiated by the students and/or recommended by the course supervisor. Students should engage in not less than 100 hours in field placement to be agreed upon by your supervisor and field tutor. During the attachment period students are required to conduct a specialize projects and submit a project report at the end for grading purpose. Performance observation report from field tutor is also an integral part of the course assessment. Students must have obtained written approval from the Programme Director at least one term in advance before being accepted to the course.",

      "description": "The Research Project aims to develop the student's ability to conduct independent research in the area of Sports Science and Physical Activity. It represents a step beyond the tutor directed Research Colloquia and Guided Study conducted in previous course. The Project will be expected to be an original research within the student's area of interest. Any relevant topic may be the subject of research, subject only to the agreement of the course committee, the availability of the necessary facilities, and the identification of a suitable supervisor. The Project must address a clearly identified problem and show evidence of familiarity with relevant literature, an appropriate experimental design and methodology, and a satisfactory interpretation of the results. At the conclusion of this course, students should be able to: 1) plan a research project; 2) conduct research in a professional and ethical manner; 3) present research effectively in written form; and 4) demonstrate in-depth knowledge of a relevant area. (Part-time students who obtain an overall GPA of 3.0 or above in their first year of attendance are eligible to take the course).",
