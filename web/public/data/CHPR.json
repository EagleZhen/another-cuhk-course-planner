Whereas environmental science tends to address how human beings affect the environment, this course focuses on how the environment affects human health. Topics include an introduction to major categories of environmental hazards that impact population health; environmental epidemiology methods in assessing the impact of environmental exposures on human health; the evaluation and control of common hazards in the work place; and the impacts of global environmental changes on health.",

Healthy Setting is a value-based approach which has the ability of translation into language to fit the context of the particular setting. The concept of Healthy Setting is evolution from Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion by building healthy public policy, re-orientation of health services, strengthening community actions, building up personal health skills and health advocacy.
