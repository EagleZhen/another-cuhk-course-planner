Whereas environmental science tends to address how human beings affect the environment, this course focuses on how the environment affects human health. Topics include an introduction to major categories of environmental hazards that impact population health; environmental epidemiology methods in assessing the impact of environmental exposures on human health; the evaluation and control of common hazards in the work place; and the impacts of global environmental changes on health.",

      "description": "Community health intervention is putting more emphasis on modification of health risk behaviours and building up the personal, cognitive and social skills which determine the ability of the individuals to gain access to, understand and make use of the information to promote and maintain good health. In many countries, there is a well-structured health care system to address diseases and illnesses but there is no system addressing health particularly on promotion of positive health. Healthy Setting is a value-based approach which has the ability of translation into language to fit the context of the particular setting. The concept of Healthy Setting is evolution from Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion by building healthy public policy, re-orientation of health services, strengthening community actions, building up personal health skills and health advocacy. This module will discuss the role of different settings in promoting health of the population. Students will gain basic understanding of healthy cities, health promoting school, health promoting workplace and other common settings.",

Education and the rule of law have been used in attempts to change people’s behaviour with limited success. Social marketing is a systematic planning process that utilizes commercial marketing techniques to change people’s behaviour and achieve social good. The primary difference between social and commercial marketing is that the ultimate goal for commercial marketing is financial gain, whereas for social marketing, it is societal gain.\n\nThis course will focus on the social marketing planning process, which includes scoping, target and behaviour selection, understanding of facilitators and barriers, and design of social marketing campaigns.",

These agencies include (but are not limited to) those that regularly employ individuals with a health promotion background, such as health education centres, non-profit health advocacy groups, hospitals/clinics, worksite wellness centres, and special population groups.\n\n3. Prior to the engagement of practicum, each student must discuss his or her potential role and responsibilities with the assigned agency supervisor within two course terms (including CHPR4902) based on the major needs of the agency. The student’s involvement in a meaningful contributing role is strongly encouraged. Upon the end of this discussion, both parties will be asked to complete and sign an official form detailing the expectations on the students and the goals/objectives of their involvement.",
