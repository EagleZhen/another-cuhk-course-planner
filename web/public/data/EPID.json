      "description": "This course is an advanced module for students who are interested in conducting systematic review and meta-analysis. It emphasizes on practical knowledge and skills needed for doing this kind of research: performing exhaustive literature search to identify relevant studies, extracting data from eligible studies, assessing risk of bias, synthesizing data, including meta-analysis, presenting results graphically and tabularly, investigating heterogeneity and potential biases, and publishing manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals. Tutorial materials will be distributed to students for their in-class exercises. Students will be enabled to master the essential skills for doing systematic review and meta-analysis by the end of this module.",

      "description": "This advanced module introduces the concept of digital epidemiology with new forms of health data and real examples for disease management. The traditional epidemiology consists of studying various risk factors of the general population to study incidence and prevalence. The field of digital epidemiology is new, but has been growing rapidly with the increasing amounts of data generated on the internet, wearable devices, and mobile APPs. Students will explore the feasibility of applications through different real digital examples, including the consideration with data privacy and protection.",
