      "description": "This course will study urban economic issues associated with environmental and social issues within urban regions. The course will study this topic from an interdisciplinary perspective. A range of topics in urban economics will be discussed including planning policies related to urban environment, migration, and transportation, as well as, zoning and livability issues, and potentials for more sustainable, just and livable cities. Students will become familiar with contemporary urban economic research and online sources of economic data. The course will prepare students to develop criteria for value judgments about the complex social, economic and environmental impact of urban design and planning.",

Important themes and debates in urban design and planning will be critically explored to understand the relationship between the urban forms, the culture of cities and their sustainable development. In particular, the way urban forms have been used and reinterpreted, adapted and challenged by different social, economic and political contexts. Exemplary design projects and planning policies are investigated in view of their relationship to contexts and their impacts on communities and the environment.",

The first part of the course covers general aspects such as research ethics, scoping of research areas, conceptualizing research frameworks and identifying relevant research questions. The second part provides students with the relevant research methods and skills for urban design, such as conducting field studies, surveys and semi-structured interviews, as well as performing a range of qualitative and quantitative analyses. Throughout the course, students will learn how to relate their findings from their mixed-method studies to address complex urban issues. The course is coordinated with studentsâ€™ work in the design studio and prepares them for their final thesis project. Assignments are organized according to sub-themes linked to the core issues of urban design.",

The effect of different environmental factors on the built environment is discussed in detail. Design features, such as buildingâ€™s orientation and form, are closely related to the design details of other design features. The quantitative aspects of the interactions between various design details are discussed with practical examples demonstrating such effects. It also examines the applications of climate-sensitive and environmental urban design in enhancing the living quality as well as the health and well-being of citizens.",
