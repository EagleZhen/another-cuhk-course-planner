      "description": "This course introduces research methods in TESOL with the goal of equipping students with the knowledge and skills to evaluate research in terms of appropriate research design, data collection instruments, and analytical procedures. The first part of the course discusses the major research traditions in TESOL, with a particular focus on classroom-based, practitioner research. The second part of the course examines a range of data collection techniques in relation to concepts such as internal/external reliability and validity. Authentic data will also be provided to students so that they can gain practical skills in qualitative and quantitative data analysis. Throughout the course, students will be expected to regularly read articles in academic journals with the aim of building an awareness of current research issues and developing their own research interests.",

Under the guidance of a supervisor, students will conceive, design and carry to completion the research study on an individual basis. They will survey relevant literature, formulate research questions, work out an appropriate methodological design, gather data, engage in critical data analysis, and report on the study in a dissertation of 8,000 to 10,000 words. Before embarking on the study, students will submit a research proposal that includes a literature review, research questions, methodology, and an implementation plan.",
