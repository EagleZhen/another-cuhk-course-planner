      "description": "Dilemmas – difficult problems or situations without easy answers – are common and inevitable in personal, professional, and civic life. How can I balance my own dreams with the wishes of my family? What is the best way to behave ethically while also making money for my company? How can a society address the needs of the majority of its citizens while also protecting the weak and needy? Resolving dilemmas often involves making choices between different options or courses of action, or resolving differences between competing interests and priorities.\n\nIn this course, we will explore ways of thinking about dilemmas, drawing on the insights of classical and modern thinkers. We will also examine a number of contemporary problems and explore their histories and backgrounds. Guest lecturers will present case studies in their own fields of study or professions.\n\nThe course will not attempt to present a comprehensive survey of moral and political philosophy. Rather, we seek to excite your interest and enthusiasm for taking on big questions and give you some tools for thinking about them. Our hope is that you will continue to explore these and other questions throughout your years at the university.",
