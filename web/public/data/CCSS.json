This period of China’s protracted war with Japan, civil war between Nationalists and Communists, and engagement in the Korean War amid the initial triumph of Mao Zedong’s Communist revolution was critical to the formation of the modern Chinese state and society. Through analysis of a wide range of readings in secondary and primary sources to be discussed and presented in class and in short papers, students will explore beyond the received narratives of political causes and military outcomes and in to the multiple ways in which war and revolution were manifested, experienced and remembered. The course will invite reflection on the complexities of social-cultural and political processes of change through war and revolution, as well as, more broadly, on the meanings and functions of violent mass conflicts for modern states and peoples.",

      "description": "Over the last three decades the Chinese media underwent a dramatic and ongoing transformation. How has this change affected Chinese politics? This course examines how politics constrain the media and how the media, in turn, shape the political process. It targets rather advanced undergraduate students that possess some background knowledge on contemporary Chinese politics, society, or communication.\nThe course will begin with a brief introduction to the history of the media in China under Communist Party rule. It will then trace the process of commercialization and internet development, and explore how these structural changes gave rise to resolute investigative journalism and flourishing online activism, as well as adaptive reconfigurations of state propaganda and censorship. This is followed by detailed investigations of media effects on popular protest, political attitudes, policy making, nationalism, and diplomacy. The class concludes with a discussion of the links between media transformation and political change.",

In keeping with the CCS educational approach, this course encourages majors to take advantage of learning “on-site” in such an internship based in Hong Kong, mainland China or Taiwan, with the course registered during the regular academic terms or in the summer school terms. Students will be expected to provide regular progress reports to their faculty adviser through a diary or online blog or video presentation, and will submit a final report assessing the organization, its engagement with Chinese society, economy, culture, and the lessons learned for practically applying area studies knowledge and skills to this field. A final oral presentation will also be given and assessed before faculty and student peers at an annual presentation of internships.",

      "description": "This course will examine key issues of urbanization and urbanity in light of Chinese experiences. Urban development in China since the economic reform has been transformative in its scale and pace of city-building and is a range of outcomes such as rapid economic development, growing income inequality, massive population mobility, and serious institutional challenges. After offering an overview of modern China’s quest for urbanization since the late imperial era, this course will focus on the massive and rapid urbanizing process in the post-reform era.\nStudents will be exposed to diverse issues, such as migration, population control, land policy, housing reform, urban planning, spatial reconfiguration, social welfare, inner-city poverty, infrastructure and transportation, environmental protection, and public space. The readings, drawn from multiple disciplines such as economics, sociology, anthropology, history, political science, and urban studies will examine the socioeconomic, political and cultural factors that contribute to the process and its particularities in the late-socialist context. This course will also seek to draw comparative lessons from China’s experience to obtain a comparative understanding of the complex socioeconomic consequences and diverse patterns of urbanizing processes across the globe.",
