It is important to remark that only 40 million of speakers out of 400 live in Spain, being Latin America the place with more native Spanish speakers in the world. Although the course can not cover all aspects, it will give students an idea about culture, politics, clothing, food, history, music, art, climate, landscapes, economy and literature. The objective is to stimulate students’ thinking about these cultures as well as their own in order to broaden their horizon and bring them the opportunity to increase their knowledge about these cultures and countries. At the end of the course students should be able to have a deeper understanding of these Spanish speaking countries.",

Although the Portuguese and Spanish-speaking states created in the early 1820s differed greatly geographically and demographically (in ethnic composition and economic resources), they also shared distinct historical and cultural traits. A chronology and guide to further reading make this volume an invaluable introduction to the rich and varied culture of modern Latin America.\nSpain: A History by Raymond Carr (Oxford University Press)\nSynopsis: In this up-to-date and engaging tour of Spain through the ages, one of the world's leading authorities on the history of Spain, Sir Raymond Carr, provides an authoritative overview of a country that has played a vital role in the history of the Western world. He tells of prehistoric Spain and of the imposition of Roman rule, which created the idea of Hispania as a single entity. There are knowledgeable discussions of the Visigoth monarchy, Moorish Spain, the establishment of an empire, and the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. Carr examines not only the political and economic development of Spain, but also the extraordinary artistic and literary achievements of the Spanish people. He charts the rise and fall of liberalism in the nineteenth century, and the subsequent period of political instability culminating in the Civil War and authoritarian rule. The book concludes with a look at modern Spain as a fully integrated and enthusiastic member of the European community. Attractively illustrated throughout, Spain: A History is the best historical account of Spain currently available for general readers.",
