      "description": "(UGEB1217 is double-coded with BMEG1217.)  This course exposes students to a range of state-of-the-arts developments in biomedical engineering. It invites students from various disciplines to discuss the long-term societal impacts and ethical implications of these technological advances, particularly in human enhancements beyond therapy. The course starts by illustrating the many amazing designs in our human body and yet how vulnerable we are in terms of injuries, diseases and ageing. Examples on how modern biomedical engineering helps us face our human conditions are given, such as musculoskeletal prosthetics and orthotics, cardiovascular implants, neuroengineering, stem cells and regenerative medicine, gene editing, bionanotechnology, intelligence and artificial intelligence and senses and artificial senses, etc. A historical account of human quest for “living” machine, including a brief coverage of modern movies on bionic human then follows. The course wraps up with some social, ethical and philosophical reflections on the above issues and on the meaning of being human, opening up questions concerning the perennial human quest of becoming super human.",

      "description": "This course is designed to help students to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the global energy crisis and environmental issues our society is currently facing. The history of energy consumption shows how important energy is to the quality of life for the human beings. With the further development and the increase of the world population, our society is challenged by an unprecedented energy demand in 21st century. At the same time, the global warming and climate changes are also causing more and more attentions. How can we meet the future energy demand? What are the energy options we currently have and what are their impacts on the environment? How can we meet our energy needs without deteriorating the environment? The first half of this course will tackle the above-raised questions by examining our current energy options and their respective impacts on the environment. Then, to address both the energy and environmental concerns, possible routes to develop a green society will be discussed in the second half of this course with a focus on renewable energy resources, smart grid, eco-friendly vehicles, and carbon sequestration and carbon audit. Lab experiments are expected to be conducted to formulate and design several different renewable energy systems toward constructing a green society. This course is relevant to SDG #7 “Affordable and Clean Energy”, SDG #9 “Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure”, and SDG #13 “Climate Action”. (No technical background is required)",

We will introduce different types of energy, from conventional fossil fuels to renewable sources, and understand their manufacturing, conversion, and utilization processes. In addition, we will discuss the environmental issues faced by modern society, such as climate change and air pollution, and explore how chemistry can provide solutions.Climate change and air pollution are closely related to energy. For examples, fossil fuel combustion can produce greenhouse gas (e.g. carbon dioxide CO2) that contribute to global warming. Combustion also produces sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) that can harm air quality and public health.This course includes lectures, class discussion, group presentation and project report of selected topic, and final examination.",

Successful stories on the evolution of S&T in human history are introduced in the perspectives of STEM, i.e., from the discovery of fundamental Scientific (Physics) (S) principles, to applying the principles to Technological (T) innovations, solving Engineering (E) problems to make the applications viable, and with Mathematics (M) as the essential language that encompasses the whole process. Modern technology is also shown to change the ways of modern scientific investigation and accelerate human understanding of the physical world in an unprecedented speed. Science related social issues are used to help students understand the importance of using science principles and knowledge in making judgements and informed decisions. Lively demonstrations, lab visit, and STEM activities are used in class to (1) illustrate basic physics principles, (2) make physics principles more connected to students’ daily life applications, and (3) better prepare students for explaining science concepts and conducting basic educational STEM activities as an educator, publisher, reporter, and in other S&T related disciplines in the future.

The course also serves as a platform to understand and critically assess global environmental change, natural hazards, biodiversity loss, and the water-energy-food nexus, and explore potential technological and policy solutions to these problems. These objectives align strongly with the understanding and pursuit of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG#7 Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG#13 Climate Action, SDG#14 Life Below Water, and SDG#15 Life on Land. In addition to attending lectures, students will visit the Jockey Club Museum of Climate Change where it displays the way scientists examine past and current climate and the factors leading to current global temperature change. A geological field excursion will be another highlight of the course to demonstrate the scientific concepts applied to reveal Earth’s tectonic history, evolution and interaction among various spheres.

There are many modern physics ideas that have captured the imagination of people, and many popular science fiction movies love to use these ideas for artistic or plot purposes. In this course, we will take a look at how these physics ideas are portrayed in selected movies, and have a discussion on how much of these are based on real science, or just pure fiction. The course also explores from a broader perspective how the advances in science and technology inspire the creation of art and pop culture, and how these derived ideas inspire generations of young people to unravel the mysteries of nature. Topics covered may include extraterrestrial civilization (Fermi paradox, SETI), spacetime travel, black holes, pulsars, space exploration, orbital dynamics, particle physics, antimatter, nuclear fusion/fission, quantum mechanics, superconductors, etc. Sometimes real physical phenomena can be even more bizarre than in movies!",

      "description": "Climate change is a subject of great interest to all concerned about the future of mankind. However, very few people realize that climate has always been changing since the formation of the Earth. Even fewer people realize that the living things in their totality exert a significant influence in shaping the evolution of the climate itself. One striking feature of the current climate change is that it has arisen from the action of one single species Homo sapiens, owing to its ability to master the use of an enormous amount of energy.This course presents the story of the Earth's atmosphere since its inception up to the current time, illustrating the close interactions between the physical world and the living world. Observations about the life phenomenon are discussed, including the role of energy in the sustenance of life, individually and collectively. The changing climate has provided the context for the development of life on Earth, in terms of dispersion and diversity. The glacial periods have also shaped the habits and character of human beings. The arrival of the recent warm interglacial period facilitated the emergence of agriculture, enabling human beings to capture and utilize more energy in their life cycles. It brought about major changes to human beings' way of life as well as significant disruptions to the delicate balance in nature. Major turning points in history such as the emergence of civilizations, the conflict between nomads and pastoralists, wars and maritime colonialism are discussed in the climate context. Industrial revolution and modern consumerism are discussed in terms of their energy consumption and the associated emission of greenhouse gases, which has given rise to the current man-made climate change. Other aspects of this enormous use of energy are discussed, including urbanization, the attrition of the self and human beings' increasing detachment from nature. Latest projections of the climate in the 21st century and the potential consequences are presented. How the human world would deal with the potential of hazardous climate change will be explored, including the particular problems faced by China as it is about to develop further. It would be a time to reflect on the core human values and how they are to be expressed in the new low-energy world.",

      "description": "This course will provide an introduction of China’s major environmental crises at local, regional, national and global scales and at different stages of development. It covers topics from air pollution (both indoor and outdoor), water shortage (due to the lack of water resources and water pollution), soil pollution, waste management, desertification & deforestation, energy transition and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as climate change. The foci will not only cover the causes and seriousness of the crises from the perspectives of science, technology, society and governance, but also solutions and emerging norms related to the topics. The course endeavors to inspire students to reflect on their own communities and how to approach sustainable development goals at a variety of scales.Multiple of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals are closely relevant to the lectures, including (7) Affordable and Clean Energy, (6) Clean Water and Sanitation, (13) Climate Action, (12) Responsible Consumption and Production, (9) Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, and (17) Partnerships for the Goals. This course uses an interdisciplinary approach to lead students through relevant key topics. Students from most departments in natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, public health, and business management will be able to find connections between these topics and their own disciplines. The approach will provide students chances to independently think about the problems beyond any discipline. Because environmental problems are frequently reflected in social and individual daily lives, the course will make students more informed in the increasingly globalizing society for their better contribution to more sustainable development.",

      "description": "Climate change, sea level rise, deforestation, forest fire, severe typhoon, glacier melt, agricultural loss, overpopulation, etc. are terms that you might have heard of. And they are also real and hot crises affecting the sustainability of human beings. How do we know these are all happening? In fact, our earth is being overseen from space every day. One good example is Google Earth that takes us any part of the globe anytime and anywhere using fingertips. Have you wondered where do these images come from? How these images are captured? How can images be used to understand the happening on our earth? Most of these images are captured by giant machines hovering in space known as satellites. “Remote sensing” is the process to collect images from the space or in the air, which is one of the key tools in the regime of spatial information technology. Important information are extracted from these images to gain better understanding of status quo and be more sustainable and responsible to our home – Earth.This course allows students to acquire basic knowledge of remote sensing and to understand how the technology is used to the study and monitor of our earth. The course is divided into two parts. The first part elucidates the basic concept of remote sensing as well as the skills in extracting information from images. The second part unveils the applications of remote sensing images to crucial sustainability issues such as urban development, agriculture, forest management, natural disaster, climate change, etc. These applications connect with three Sustainable Development Goals including #11 (sustainable cities and community), #13 (climate action) and #15 (life on land) set by the United Nations in 2015. Loads of remotely-sensed images are used to illustrate the natural process and human activities that alter the earth surface and to explore the issue of sustainability. Together with hands-on work in tutorials and interactive class activity, students would be aware of how this novel technology is exploring the future of human beings.",

Questions like “how do we perceive music,” “how does music arouse emotions in us,” “can artificial intelligence (AI) perceive music like us,” “how can AI recognize emotions expressed in music,” “can AI arouse emotions in us through music” are all scientific in nature. This interdisciplinary course invites students to analyse and appreciate music from two scientific perspectives, namely, psychology and AI. It begins with musical elements, which are the basic building blocks of music, from the viewpoint of both music perception and production. The science behind those elements is explored with an emphasis on how they evoke emotions. We then examine the basic concepts of AI and its capability of producing music applications including music emotion recognition and automatic music composition. Along with interactive lectures, students will engage in hands-on experiences and class discussions that culminate towards various music-related AI projects. No prior knowledge in music or programming is required.",

      "description": "As the most populous country in the world, China is confronted by the problems of overpopulation, water scarcity, energy shortage, desertification, drought, floods, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Since 1978 the economy has grown rapidly and as of to date, it has become a rising economic power of the world. However, the environmental and ecological problems have reached a point whereby sustainable growth is jeopardized. To solve the problems of limited resource per capita, as well as encourage economic development, China has implemented and planned for a series of mega projects of far-reaching repercussions, the scale of which is unmatched in the history of mankind. They range from multi-purpose water conservancy projects to renewable energy projects and inter-provincial railway construction. These projects have been conceived for decades yet highly controversial and expensive to build. Meanwhile, China has made a commitment that it will shoulder the responsibility of implementing the 2030 development agenda (17 Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs), and seek solidarity and cooperation to constantly push the cause of global development. This course gives students a general background of these mega-projects, the problems they attempt to resolve, benefits, as well as how these projects trying to meet the SDGs (especially the SDGs 6, 7 and 13 of water scarcity, affordable clean energy and climate actions, respectively), and the potential collaborations with other countries contributing to human well-being. After taking this course, students should have a comprehensive understanding about the occurrence, nature and sustainable solutions of the various environmental problems China is facing.",

      "description": "Globalization processes have been affecting every nook and corner of the world. We are all fascinated by the mushrooming of transnational companies; the increasing cross-boundary flows of resources as well as the increasing competition among places and cities. Resource becomes a keen issue due to the growth of population, trade and economy in the age of globalization. Good management of resources will thus be both global and local concerns. In this regard and with the advent of the global agenda 2030, there is increasing enthusiasm in addressing the most pressing and challenging issues that the world is facing today, and these are Globalization and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).This course will thus focus on the interaction of man and environment in a geographical context with special reference to a selection of relevant SDGs. By adopting different perspectives, a variety of resource issues ranging from natural resources to economic and human resources will be examined. The course will be divided into two parts. The first part will be the discussion of basic concepts of globalization and resource issues in the society that are related to selected SDGs. The second part will be issue-based analyses of different resource issues that affect lives in modern societies and that could make a difference in the pursuit of the SDGs particularly in this age of globalization. Various cases in the real world will be analyzed. This course will help students to broaden their views on the SDGs and understand the importance and implications of resource issues in both developing and developed countries.",

The course will demonstrate the use of the theoretical framework through the analysis of real Hong Kong cases, field trips, video watching and assignments. Through these various learning activities, students are expected to acquire the relevant knowledge and develop skills in critical analysis, data collection, field observation and capability in policy evaluation and problem solving.",

      "description": "What are the major natural hazards and why do they occur around the world? What places are most vulnerable to multiple hazards? What are the disasters caused by a hazard and how do people respond? How to manage various types of natural hazards which affect the sustainability of urban and rural development? Students will find enormous interest in seeking answers to these questions. This course examines the physical and human dimensions of natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, landslides, tropical cyclones, floods and droughts. Through a variety of teaching and learning activities, this course will help students understand major natural hazards from a regional perspective, in terms of their causes, location and distribution, human responses to prepare, prevent and mitigate their impacts on sustainable development.Effective management and mitigation of natural hazards are essential for building safe, resilient, and sustainable cities (SDG11) and for combating and adapting to climate change (SDG13). This course provides students with real-life examples that help students understand the relevant economic, social and environmental issues caused by natural hazards. The knowledge empowers students to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation measures to minimise the impact on people, contributing to more resilient and sustainable societies. Study of the interaction between society and natural hazards will help students better understand the man-environment relationship. An issue-based approach from a topical perspective is adopted to address a wide variety of geological, meteorological, and hydrological hazards. The importance of geographical regions in understanding natural hazards and their socio-economic impacts is highlighted throughout the course. Case studies of occurrences and natural hazard management in Hong Kong and other parts of the world are emphasized.",

Yet, few people really understand their formation and presence. This course introduces students to the concepts and processes of environmental change, such as climate change, land use change, desertification, and habitat loss.The course adopts a scientific approach to help students understand the processes of environmental change behind some of the planet’s famous natural landscapes, landforms and natural phenomena. These shall include the natural processes (geological, atmospheric, hydrological and ecological) and anthropogenic processes (land use change, fossil fuel combustion and infrastructure development). The course is designed around the four themes of: (i) the processes and patterns of landscape formation; (ii) the combination of natural and human-induced environmental change; (iii) benefits of natural wonders to human beings; and (iv) the methods and challenges of protecting natural wonders.This course will cover at least three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), namely SDG13 Climate Action, SDG14 Life Below Water, and SDG15 Life On Land. The impact of climate change on various natural wonders and related human well-being will be examined, along with possible ways to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Also, the influence of human activities on terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as well as possible options for their sustainable management will be discussed.",

Biotechnology, the use of living organisms to make products, has already led to the new industrial revolution, which creates hundreds of thousand jobs and tens of billion dollars revenue in the United States. This course aims to introduce students some fundamental knowledge of how genes determine and control our appearance and behaviour. Recent discoveries of some genes in inheritable diseases (e.g. cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, etc.), aging and death will be addressed. Successful examples of using biotechnology to improve our medicinal, agricultural and environmental practices will be introduced. Some ethical, legal and social issues generated from genetic research and biotechnology will also be discussed.

      "description": "The Earth is an intricate and fragile system. Slight differences in the terrain of neighbouring areas on the Earth can lead to variations in climate, geology, and marine resources. The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is located in the southern coastal area of China and has a subtropical climate influenced by the East Asian Monsoon. Two cities of the GBA, Hong Kong and Shenzhen, are geographically neighbours on the eastern side of the Pearl River estuary. Still, the interaction of oceanic, geologic, and atmospheric systems has shaped their local weather patterns and influenced the availability and distribution of natural resources.This course highlights the geophysics, macroclimate, and marine science of the GBA and the microclimate in Hong Kong’s and Shenzhen’s areas. It aims to engage students in exploring the interconnectedness of the Earth and the sky through interdisciplinary subjects, thereby reflecting on human responsibilities to the natural environment, including the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems and the sustainable use of marine resources. The topics to be covered include the physics of meteorology, the principles of geology, astronomical relevance to climate, human influence on long-term climate, and natural disasters. Additionally, the course includes visiting meteorological institutions, geoparks, and high-tech marine companies.",

      "description": "Throughout human history, we have developed different ways to strive for living in nature. Among which, agriculture is the foundation of all sedentary civilizations as it systematically provides food and other products to sustain human lives. It is an art that integrates knowledge of nature with human needs and values, evolving side by side with the development of science and technology. Today, with the advancement of scientific technology, the highly industrialized modern agriculture has greatly increased food production to support the global population growth. Yet it also brings global ethical concerns regarding sustainability, food safety, biotechnology, pollution, etc. In the past decades, increasing attention has been given to permaculture, an alternative agricultural practice that emphasizes the development of durable and self-sufficient ecosystems in farming. Permaculture is not only a practice of sustainable food production, it is also a philosophy of living with nature.In this course, students will learn through lectures the basic knowledge about modern agriculture and its applications of science and technology; understand the fundamental principles, philosophy, and practice of permaculture; discuss the ethical issues related to the use of science and technology in modern agriculture; reflect on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, such as “Zero Hunger”, “Affordable and Clean Energy”, “Sustainable Cities and Communities”, and “Responsible Consumption and Reproduction”. Students will also experience the practices of modern agriculture and permaculture by making site-visits to enterprises of the agricultural industry, and to institutes practicing permaculture. Students who finish this course will be able to describe and compare the major principles and practices of modern agriculture and those of permaculture, analyze the ethical issues related to modern agriculture in contemporary societies, and formulate personal views on how to live more ethically with nature.",

      "description": "Environmental protection is an important part of modern civilization for the fact that human life and the sustainable development of society are based on natural resources from the environment. While there are common principles and practices for protecting the environment, local contexts might add to the intricacy between humans and their environment, and thus create multiple perspectives for intellectual pursuits. For example, cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) share and enjoy a lot of marine resources in the Pearl River Delta. However, coastal cities in the GBA, including Hong Kong and Shenzhen have been heavily impacted by pollution arising from rapid economic transformations and industrial developments in the last few decades. For such a global issue, concerted efforts have been made in scientific studies, implementation of international policies and strengthening of local governance to restore the damaged environment and properly manage our natural resources. Progress has been made but environmental issues remain a huge challenge to mankind.This course aims to engage students in re-examining some current strategies for environmental protection at national, regional, local and even personal levels, by guiding them to study selected prevailing environmental problems, general practices of the society and some representative interregional collaborations in the GBA. While general principles in environmental science will be outlined, this course will focus on water resources, management of pollution in the coastal area and regional collaborations upon the issues. To gain first-hand experience in the present situation of their own city and neighbouring regions, students from CUHK and CUHK(SZ) will participate in field trips and scientific investigations. Tutorial discussions and writing assignments are learning opportunities for students to reflect on and evaluate the implementation of current environmental policies and interregional collaborations in the Greater Bay Area, in terms of the possibilities those policies and collaborations have brought, their significance and issues arising from them. The course serves as a platform across human experience and knowledge for students to exchange ideas, propose new ideas and embark on the journey to a better world as local inhabitants and global citizens.",

Our society is on the verge of a new era of technology convergence: robotic devices are envisioned to become a nearly ubiquitous part of our day-to-day lives. New technologies such as wireless communication and voice and visual recognition will make robots become behaviour-based, cognitive and biologically inspired humanoids. Fundamental social, economical, and technological issues of a human-machine society will be identified and discussed in interactive sessions. This learning process transcends the conventional boundaries between technology and other disciplines, and it is facilitated with a series of demonstrative sessions which present students with opportunities to observe, evaluate, examine, and interact with a variety of commercial robots and humanoids. Guided by internal and external experts, students will also focus on a specific social, business or technology issue, identifying and exploring potential solutions with robotic and automation technology that could potentially impact the quality of our life. In this exploration process, students are encouraged to apply their personal background and interest to conceive and experiment with the aid of popular robot kits. The course will cultivate students with enriched perspectives of a future society.",

Complex life is built from some molecules that slowly evolved into diverse living organisms, which then interact with the environment to form ecosystems and finally shape the biosphere where we all live in. Studies of the biological world allow us to understand more on how life has evolved and lead to significant advancement in our ability to improve living quality, but at the same time create a lot of controversies and problems. This course firstly aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive view on the biological world, starting from the simplest DNA to simple single-celled organisms, and then to more complicated living organisms, and finally to the most complex ecosystems and biosphere; and to guide students to appreciate the Wonders and majesty of the biological world. Students will also be introduced examples of how insights from studying the biological world can improve our health, living quality and environment, and may affect the future societal development. Students will be introduced to examples that are relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals including SDG #3 “Good Heath and Well Being, SDG #7 “Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG #13 “Climate Action” and SDG #15 “Life on Land”. The important roles of biotechnology will be discussed, such as how human diseases can be prevented and treated, and how global climate change can be mitigated.",

Behind the scenes of food enjoyment, lots of science and technology has been applied in their manufacturing processes to ensure that the food products are preserved in high standards of quality, nutrition and safety. Among those food manufacturing and processing methods, however, some of them are quite controversial and thus arouse many public concerns over food safety and security issues. This course is designed for the general students to provide them with some key concepts and scientific knowledge in food preservation, processing technology and food safety control, as well as to explore the interactive relationships between them. Through learning the basic properties of foodborne hazards, which are the origins of most food safety problems, students are able to enhance the understandings on the principles and practices of respective food preservation methods and processing technologies. Meanwhile, the potential risks and adverse effects of particular food processing technologies will be discussed. Furthermore, some highly concerning topics and incidents about food safety will be analysed based on scientific facts and discussed from different perspectives. After finishing the course, students are encouraged to use the acquired knowledge to make better food choices, distinguish the fallacies about food and appraise the impact of modern technology on human food safety and security.",

      "description": "In recent years, the United Nations had proposed a global plan aiming to end poverty and protect the globe, and ensure that people living on this planet enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. The goal is going to be achieved and performed by 17 integrated subdivisions, which are also known as the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Biodiversity, conservation, environmental management, and related technologies are essential and are brought together under this bigger theme of sustainability. Biotechnology, here thus plays a great role, as it infiltrates in different part of our lives — from the food we eat to how we collect them, the drugs we take to treat illnesses, the fuel we use to power up devices and even the conservation of biodiversity and the environmental health. While biotechnology is a broad discipline that exploits different biological processes, organisms, cells or cellular components to develop new and effective technologies and is a newly emerged and an ongoing field in biological sciences, it offers opportunities to aid achieving different global matters that are happening currently or in the foreseeable future, especially issues relating but not limited to food crisis, one health, energy shortage, sustainable infrastructure and biodiversity in different habitats, etc.This course provides a wide scope of knowledge relating to biotechnology that aims to stimulate thoughts and broaden the horizon of students from different background. It also allows the students to embrace the beauty and understand the constraint, including ethical, social, environmental and technological challenges of biotechnology. This course focuses on three major themes: 1). Introduction of the basic biotechnology knowledge of genetics and extended biotechnology techniques, 2). Showcases of the latest biotechnological developments and applications in various aspects of life sciences, 3). Discussion of key values of biotechnology and the philosophical, moral and ethical issues of biotechnology. Ultimately, this course aims at raising the awareness and promote the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are related to SDG#2 Zero Hunger, SDG#3 Good Health and Well-being, SDG#7 Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG#9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG#11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG#14 Life Below Water and SDG#15 Life On Land, to the students.",

Topics covered will include: Powers of Ten journey of the universe, apparent motions of celestial bodies, seasons, the Moon, eclipses, basic astronomical observation; descriptions of gravity and motions, its applications on solar system and beyond, including the phenomena of planets and small bodies, and its manifestations in space travel and popular science culture, such as exoplanets, doomsday astronomy, black holes, and cosmology. Lectures are designed not focusing on a volume of knowledge and theories, but also and phenomena to arouse students’ curiosity in how nature works, and understand our relationship with the universe. An optional star-gazing night and/or visit to Hong Kong Space Museum will be arranged. Compared with UGEB 2401 Astronomy, this course provides a shorter introduction to the essential ideas and phenomena in astronomy which students may encounter in their daily life, and focuses on arousing students’ interests in operations of modern science through lively contexts in astronomical discoveries and popular science culture.",

      "description": "Hong Kong is very famous for its superb cuisine, which is a fantastic fusion of eastern and western styles. Cooking is both an art and a science. Good tasting foods and drinks are the results of perfect matches of ingredients and cooking methods. Foods and drinks is related to chemistry closely. Having some understanding about the chemistry of the food ingredients and the various cooking methods can help appreciating the connections between science and human life. This course will discuss the Hong Kong cuisine culture from the chemistry perspective, to explain why these famous foods and drinks are so tasty and popular. Examples include Chinese rotisserie (Siu Mei), wonton noodles, steamed seafoods, stewed beef brisket, silk stocking milk tea, and century egg with pickled ginger, etc. Consuming food and soups that carry health and therapeutic values is also a unique food culture in China and Southeast Asia. The course will introduce several types of food that are traditionally considered to have some specific functions, and discuss their scientific justifications from the chemistry point of views. Besides, pre-packaged food and fast food is an important eating culture of modern urban people. Some important issues about pre-packaged food and fast food, such as food storage and packaging, uses of approved (and sometimes prohibited) food additives, alternative ingredients, and food testing, will also be discussed.",

This course investigates long-term evolutionary perspectives on the human species. The basics of evolution and natural selection as scientific theories are clearly set out and examined, and common misconceptions discussed. Evidence for the evolution of mammals and primates is reviewed and discussed, and the common characteristics of these species are highlighted, demonstrating the connections between humans and other forms of life. The course covers what we know about human ancestors and the evolution of modern humans. Students are introduced to the wide range of human adaptations to local conditions across contemporary cultures and the variety of relationships that human populations have with the environment. Students are encouraged to use the knowledge they have acquired to ask: are these relationships always sustainable? Looking to the future: what are our responsibilities both to future generations of humans and towards other species with which we share our world? This course aims to give students an understanding and appreciation of evolutionary perspectives on the place of humans in the world, the variety of contemporary human societies, and a broad perspective on the complexity of the relationship between humans, the environment and other species.",

It is almost inevitable for people to have encountered individuals with unclear speech, hoarse voice, stuttering, autism spectrum disorder, hearing impairment and dementia etc. in their lifetime. Students without a background in speech and hearing sciences may not have solid understanding of the essentials of human communication and its disorders. This course thus aims to provide tailor-made content suiting all students to cover the fundamentals of these topics from the perspective of speech-language-pathology. The course consists of 3 major components. The first one brings out the essential elements in normal communication. The second component covers what goes wrong in the chain of communication which leads to various communication disorders. The third component introduces various communication disorders in terms of the general characteristics and the practical tips on how to interact with them through case studies. By learning the essential elements of effective communication skills as well as gaining knowledge on how to facilitate interaction with people who have diverse communication and educational needs, this course also helps students to better understand the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) relating to #3 Good Health and Well-being, #4 Inclusive Quality Education and #10 Reduced Inequalities.",

      "description": "A communication disorder is an impairment in the ability to receive, send, process, and comprehend concepts or verbal, nonverbal and graphic symbol systems. A communication disorder may be evident in the processes of hearing, language, and/or speech. A communication disorder may range in severity from mild to profound.Specifically, speech and language impairment (SLI) refers to any one or combination of the following conditions that may lead to communication difficulties – a) speech sound disorders, b) voice disorders, c) fluency disorders, d) language disorders. Students with SLI may encounter difficulties in communicating effectively with others, which may affect one’s self-esteem and development of social relationships. They may have difficulties in understanding and / or giving oral presentations, struggle in following rapid verbal exchanges which may limit their participation in classes. They may also lack confidence in speaking in front of public or a large group of people. They may thus have trouble adapting to the course work and university life. This is partially attributable to the lack of awareness of SLI among university students and teachers. The course aims to provide general education on knowledge and skills relating to daily communications with students with Speech and Language Impairment (SLI) in academic or social settings, and facilitate equal access to quality education. This course is an SDG-GE course, which aims to promote good health and well-being in the university population, reduce inequality among students with different abilities, and thus facilitate equal access to quality education. The course also helps students to understand the social and economic considerations relevant to speech and language impairment (SLI).",

      "description": "This course aims to provide an overview of the oceans and the roles of natural and anthropogenic impacts on shaping the physical and biological aspects of the oceans. The main themes of the course include the ocean processes, the marine ecosystems and their inhabitants, and the relationships between oceans and mankind. Emphasis will be placed on how natural processes shape the oceans, how the inhabitants survive the marine environment, how we depend on the oceans, the impact of anthropogenic processes on the oceans, and how the future of mankind is affected by the oceans. Examples of topics covered include: the Earth and the oceans, ecosystems of the oceans, marine organisms and their adaptations to the marine environment, exploitation of the oceans, and the management and conservation of the oceans. Altogether, this course also aims to raise awareness and promote the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are related to SDG#13 Climate Action and SDG#14 Life Below Water. A laboratory visit to the Simon F.S. Li Marine Science Laboratory will be included to demonstrate the methodology and instruments used in marine research.",
