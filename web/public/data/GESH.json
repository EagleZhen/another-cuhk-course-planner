      "description": "The course title states the two related goals of this course, designed to help freshers develop a positive attitude towards college life. Through a careful sequenced selection of outdoor team activities, workshops, service and work projects, students are challenged to examine their orientation in life as they become college members in university. Success of the course hinges on balancing two axes of concern, namely, (1) between teamwork and personal development and (2) between inward reflection and outward expression.This course is the major common learning experience of college students across all disciplines and years, initiating a fresher's identity as a member of S.H. Ho College. The activity-based approach facilitates the cohort of freshers to bond together as well as to integrate with the college community. As such, this induction course is a cornerstone of our College General Education (\"CGE\") Programme.Mission: To induce communal learning in college lifeVision: College as a community of learners in dialogue",

They need to map out a detailed and practical proposal for their actions to take in collaboration with their community partners.\nThey are encouraged to document the process of their service.

They could discuss three core questions:\nWhat insights did you gain through your project that might assist you in your career or in selecting a career?\nWhat impact might your project have on your life-long learning process?\nWhat did you learn about community involvement, citizenship and civic responsibility?\nDemonstration\nIn this module, students will demonstrate what they have learned throughout the process of service-learning through a more formal presentation, including a review of their proposal, community service, new findings, suggestions and reflections. This module aims to consolidate their leanings and extend the impact of their project to others through sharing their experiences.",
