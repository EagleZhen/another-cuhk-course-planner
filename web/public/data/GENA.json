      "description": "Promoting Chinese history and culture is one of the core missions of New Asia College. “Service Learning – Bringing Chinese Culture into Local Community” encourages students to participate in activities about Chinese culture and/or cultural conservation projects in local community through observation, recording, promotion and transmission. This course aims to enhance students’ understanding of the meanings and values of traditional Chinese cultural heritages (both tangible and intangible) and the spirit they inherit in a modern and cosmopolitan city. The course also aims to integrate service and learning experiences through community service activities. It seeks to cultivate students’ leadership skills and foster their self-awareness and empathy towards others and the community. In addition, the programme also emphasizes reflection on the quality of service leadership with particular focus on intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies.There will be different sessions under this course that focus on various aspects of Chinese culture, for example, moral values, arts, customs and festivals, etc. Through the delivery of service, the students will be able to share with the members of local community the experience of appreciating Chinese culture and its values.",

      "description": "“Service Learning – Make a Difference to Our Community” aims to enable students to use sustainable methods to help local community or socially disadvantaged groups. In collaborating with different NGOs and university departments or research units, students will be introduced to key concepts and theories of sustainable development and explore how to apply them to proposing solutions to the needs and difficulties faced by disadvantaged groups. The course also aims to integrate service and learning experiences through community service activities. It seeks to cultivate students’ leadership skills and foster their self-awareness and empathy towards others and the community. In addition, the program also emphasizes reflection on the quality of service leadership with particular focus on intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies.There will be different sessions under the course that focus on various aspects of sustainable development, for example, poverty, clean energy, marine pollution, etc. Through the service-learning activities, students and community members are expected to foster their cohesiveness and concerns about the local community.",

      "description": "“Service Learning – Creating a Better World through Diversity and Inclusion” aims to promote diversity and inclusion to the community. The course will create opportunities for students to get in touch with vulnerable groups or minority members in the city. By engaging in a variety of projects or activities such as in-depth visits and interviews, students are expected to understand the environment and difficulties their target groups have been facing. The course consists of lectures, service learning experiences, and self-reflection sessions. Key concepts such as openness, civility, and inclusivity will be discussed in class, while a core principle that no individual and group should be discriminated against based on race, ethnicity, geographic provenance, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, language, ability/disability, or socioeconomic status will be stressed as these values and principles are embraced by the University and are essential to social cohesion. The course also aims to integrate service and learning experiences through community service activities. It seeks to cultivate students’ leadership skills and foster their self-awareness and empathy towards others and the community. In addition, the course also emphasizes reflection on the quality of leadership that demonstrates while providing service, with the particular focus on intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies.There will be different sessions under this course that focus on various aspects and subjects under the general theme diversity and inclusion, for example, multicultural groups, Special Educational Needs (SEN), gender equality, etc. Through the delivery of service, the students will be equipped with skills and a positive attitude to tackle social issues through collaborating with different NGO partners, and ultimately, be able to apply their knowledge and skills to real-world settings in meaningful and impactful ways.Diversity and inclusion are crucial principles of achieving the SDG goals of “Gender Equality” and “Reducing Inequality”. By respecting different cultures and minimizing stereotypes and prejudices, it will promote an atmosphere conducive to “Good Health and Well-being” of our society, with particular concern of mental health.",

Anthropologists argue that sex, gender, and the relationship between men and women are not given but largely products of cultural and social processes. We argue that political, economic, material, and environmental factors are a part of such processes. This course will start with introducing core concerns, arguments, and approaches related to gender and sexuality. After the introductory sessions, we will focus, week by week, on common (or controversial) gender and sexual issues we encounter in lives. These weeks will be discussion intensive and relevant analysis and scholarly works will be introduced to deepen your understanding of gender and sexuality via the topics. Students are encouraged to examine their own gender identities and beliefs critically; to not only understand how our gender assumptions are shaped but also to develop their own gender statement.

What kind of long-term policy do we have? How should the intangible heritage preservation and management be carried out?

The course examines the correlation between art and institutions in twentieth-century China, aiming to encourage students to think about modern Chinese art through the concept of the artworld. The downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republican China transformed the social and institutional organisation of the production, distribution, and consumption of art as well as the traditional patronage system in modern China. The structural changes conditioned the emergence of formal and informal art institutions that facilitated yet constrained artistic practices, laying the foundation for the development of a modern art world in China. The course looks at the history of modern Chinese art and the formation of different art institutions in the sociocultural and economic context of modern China. Weekly topics are structured chronologically and thematically, which cover a wide range of themes, including art schools, art societies, museums, exhibitions, and art market. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, the course offers students multi-perspectives to understand the transformation of modern Chinese art and the interactions between artistic practices and society in modern China.",

      "description": "From the first word you spoke as a child to the last word you ever say, the language you use to communicate is shaping how you experience your life, including your sense of self, conflicts with others, success in your career, and relationships with those you love. But what forms of interpersonal communication create pain, alienation, and amplify conflicts? And what forms of communication overcome fear, create trust, freedom, and fulfilling human connection? “Empowerment through Nonviolent Communication” provides students with a proven toolset for managing interpersonal conflicts, called Nonviolent Communication (NVC), while preserving trust and connection. These tools can be used in nearly all areas of social life. NVC, also known as Compassionate Communication, was pioneered by clinical psychologist Marshall B. Rosenberg and further developed by decades of global practitioners. Upon completing the course, students will understand NVC theories and be able to use its various tools in their daily lives. Lectures and discussions will also address the use of NVC in the context of Hong Kong and Chinese culture more generally. Students are advised that NVC methods cannot be learned as a purely intellectual exercise: you must bring to class your heart and mind. Learning activities will involve personal sharing, role plays, and reflective journal writing. Within respectful limits, students must be willing to engage in personal self-reflection and sharing; also, students must strictly abide by a confidentiality agreement not to disclose the personal stories of others outside of class.This course supports advancement towards the Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education, Reducing Inequality, and Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. Equitable participation in society and education are advanced through communication without coercion and harm, which is nonviolent communication. Institutions are strengthened through nonviolent communication that promotes reform and advancement while affirming the human need for security and respect.",

Media forms old and new – newspapers, magazines, films, radio, television, pop music, Internet, social media, and mobile phones – are shaping our social and political life, cultivating our cultural imaginations, and articulating our personal experiences and a sense of belonging in a rapidly changing world.
