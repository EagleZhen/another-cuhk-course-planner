Students will explore the anatomical, physiological, biomechanical, and neurological mechanisms that underlie human movement and physical activity. Through a combination of lectures, labs, and hands-on activities, students will develop a strong foundational understanding of the science of human movement. This introductory course lays the groundwork for a more advanced study in the multidisciplinary field of human movement science, such as exercise physiology, biomechanics, athletic training, and exercise psychology.",

Key elements such as observational skill, motor learning ability as well as other vital teaching techniques will be emphasized in this course. Students will be assessed by three domains including: (a) knowledge, (b) skill performance, and (c) skill demonstration. In the section of fundamental movement skills (FMS), students are required to innovate and organize different modes of teaching strategies and learning activities for teaching locomotor, stability and manipulative skills. In dance section, students work in group to design the choreography for dance. This course will also develop students' generic skills such as the creativity, communication, collaboration and problem solving skills through the learning activities of fundamental movement skills and dance, so as to enable them to teach confidently and professionally in their future careers.",

In order to understand how the body performs and responds to physical activity, it is important to build a foundation of knowledge in the field of sport and exercise physiology. Therefore, the general aim of this course is to provide the students with up-to-date information for understanding the physiology of exercise.\n\nThis course examines the basic concepts of energy metabolism, nutrition and the physiological responses to exercise and training. Emphasis will be placed on the application of such knowledge upon teaching physical education and upon the improvement of exercise performance. The students are provided with hands-on experience of conducting laboratory work, which examines the physical responses to exercise.",

Therefore, student-teachers would grasp this opportunity to experience and understand the real situation in teaching profession. Major students are required to take 8 units of Teaching Practice (TP). These units are spread over two years of study whereas students are placed in a variety of primary schools to implement their teaching in authentic school environment and become acquainted with the organization, administration and discipline of primary schools in Hong Kong. Students can design their physical education lessons by applying the pedagogical skills and teaching theories learnt in SPED3450 (pedagogy in primary physical education) and other practical skill courses to the authentic teaching environment.",

This course is designed to introduce students to theories and concepts in curriculum planning for primary and secondary physical education (PE). In this course, current curriculum policies and guidelines addressed by the Education Bureau and curriculum models with particular reference to physical education are addressed. In addition, stages of planning, implementation and evaluation of curriculum planning are discussed. Students are guided to develop critical thinking and reflective and problem-solving skills through class discussions and group works, so that they are able to construct their ideas on PE curriculum design with the consideration of their personal teaching philosophy and the visions and missions of the entire education and physical education.\nUp-to-date issues and practices related to overseas and local PE curriculums nowadays will be discussed throughout the course to let students analyze the problems and generate possible solutions for tackling with the problems encountered in PE nowadays, for instance, limited PE time, lack of motivation and low physical activity levels in PE, students’ physical abilities, health and mental issues, etc. Through the process of identifying the problems, suggesting solutions, developing action plans and evaluation, our students as the pre-service teachers would be more self-initiated to reflect their roles as a gatekeeper for developing effective PE curriculums for Hong Kong primary and secondary school students. In the 21st century, health issues are always the controversial topic all over the world. Therefore, we expect PE professionals could create a supportive and motivational learning environment in school physical education for nurturing our young generations their interests in physical activities and lifelong exercise habits in their lifetime.",

With the supervisions and guidance of SSPE TP Supervisors, External TP Supervisors and Teaching Advisors, students can equip and prepare themselves as a competent physical education teacher in the future through the experiences acquired during teaching practice. Therefore, student-teachers would grasp this opportunity to experience and understand the real situation in teaching profession. Major students are required to take 8 units of Teaching Practice (TP). These units are spread over two years of study whereas students are placed in a variety of secondary schools to implement their teaching in authentic school environment and become acquainted with the organization, administration and discipline of secondary schools in Hong Kong. Students can design their physical education lessons by applying the pedagogical skills and teaching theories learnt in SPED3440 (pedagogy in secondary physical education) and other practical skill courses to the authentic teaching environment.",

      "description": "The Research Project is a compulsory course for final year undergraduate students of the Department of Sports Science and Physical Education. It aims to develop the student’s ability to conduct independent research in the area of physical education, exercise science and health. The development, undertaking and completion of the project is the culmination of the BEd/BSc learning experience and students must take and pass the course of Research Methods (SPED 3630) prior to enrolling to this course. It is intended to be a largely independent piece of work, which is aimed at combining and utilising the research skills and knowledge developed and gained from other relevant previous courses, and using these to complete a piece of original research within the student’s area of interest.",
