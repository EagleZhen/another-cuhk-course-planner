The world energy use, which is considered to be the cause of global warming, and the impacts are discussed in the course. In this course, students will learn about the radiation budgets/balance in the atmosphere, possible climate forcings that can upset the energy balance, how the earth’s global average temperature is measured, why global warming is described as “the biggest hoax” in human history, observations from the ocean and cryosphere and popular environmental issues/arguments discussed in the mainstream media. Newest observations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report are included throughout the course.\n\nThis course actively incorporates elements of innovation, design, global citizenship and social enterprisingness by asking the students to think innovatively but critically about possible solutions to adapt to and combat climate change and the global energy/health crisis. Different options including their pros and cons are actively discussed in class. Students are encouraged to think creatively about the problem from different angles, e.g., by standing in the shoes of climate skeptics – evaluating their “data”, how they present them, the arguments put forth by them – in order to develop a strategic approach to best communicate the issues to a variety of stakeholders. Project assignments will allow students to focus on one particular environmental issue in other part of the world, attempting to address the issue in the very different geographical, cultural, economic and political contexts from that of the students. Example projects can be “How to use geoengineering to combat climate change?”, “How can Sub-Saharan Africa secure its future food supply under the threat of climate change?”, etc. In the course, students will define and understand the problem. They shall form groups and discuss their own point of views and search information on the evidence of the corresponding arguments. They will present their ideas in class and write a self-reflection report. Each of the group will have to make an “infographic”- a layout of science knowledge learnt in the project that is easy enough for the public to understand but at the same time informative. Good infographics will be used in our OpenDay.",

      "description": "Remote sensing observations are critical for monitoring regional and global changes, determining spatial and temporal variability of the Earth System, and addressing fundamental global issues. This course introduces the basic physical principles of remote sensing, including electromagnetic waves and radiation, optical, microwave, and non-imaging remote sensing. It also presents key concepts and examples on remote sensing applications in Earth system science (such as atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere) and global changes. This course also provides computer-based lab exercises that facilitate the understanding of remote sensing principles and the processing of remote sensing data.",

With the help from laboratory analysis and case studies, remote sensing applications in Earth system science can be further understood. The students will develop: 1) the ability to evaluate an issue critically based on evidence and scientific principle, 2) to acquire knowledge effectively by self-study and using information technology, and to work independently, 3) to work effectively in a team, and 4) to present information in a clear, concise and logical manner. The students also can acquire a responsible attitude in study and work, and have motivation for life-long learning.",
