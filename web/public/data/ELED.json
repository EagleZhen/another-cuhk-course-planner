Throughout the three courses, special attention will be paid to English language teaching pedagogy for current local curricular developments. These courses will include opportunities for observation of videotaped lessons and peer teaching. The first course focuses on developing the general competency, knowledge, strategies and skills a teacher needs in order to organise effective learning in the language classroom under the aegis of a communicative approach to language teaching and learning. A wide range of techniques and teaching strategies suitable for learners of different ages, proficiency levels and learning needs will be included. Topics include lesson planning, motivating, engaging and interacting with learners, classroom organization and management, dealing with errors, classroom language and using and evaluating learning materials. Teaching of grammar and vocabulary will also be covered.",
