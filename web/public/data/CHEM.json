Qualitative Feedbacks from Students\nFeedbacks are collected from students informally about their opinions on the course. The feedbacks are collected through the interactions between students and the instructor during the class sessions.\n\n4. Qualitative Feedbacks from Demonstrators\nFeedbacks are collected from the lab demonstrators about their suggestions/comments on the course. Meetings between demonstrators and the instructor are held to collect and discuss the feedbacks given by the demonstrators.\n\n5. Instructor’s reflection\nThe course materials/organization are regularly amended/adjusted with reference to:\n- Students’ feedbacks (qualitative and quantitative feedbacks)\n- Demonstrators’ feedbacks (qualitative feedbacks)\n- The learning needs of the students (designed/addressed by the course teacher/instructor)\n- Students’ performance in the course (qualitative – quality of their acquired skills and the laboratory reports submitted; quantitatively – the actual marks obtained by the students)\n- Peers’ comments (teaching staff of related fields in the Department)",

The lecturer will first introduce four types of biomolecules, namely peptides and proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids to chemistry students, with a focus on their molecular structures, higher-order structures and organizations, and the organic reactions to synthesize or to transform these molecules in a synthetic laboratory or inside cells. Enzymes, a special group of proteins will also be introduced to the audience, together with cofactors and coenzymes as one example of proteins possessing catalytic power. The second module of the course will focus on chemical biology, including current technologies developed and selected research projects in this field. Through this course, students will be able to apply their basic organic chemistry knowledge to complicated biological molecules, and deepen their understanding on molecules in life, from an organic chemist's point of view. This course will be distinct from an introductory biochemistry course by focusing on the organic chemistry aspects of the molecules in life, i.e. molecular structures, higher-order structures, functional groups, transformations, reactions and syntheses.",

The course has three modules. Module 1 covers the chemical structures, reactions, synthesis, and functions of biomolecules. The lecturer will first introduce four types of biomolecules, namely peptides and proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids to chemistry students, with a focus on their molecular structures, higher-order structures and organizations, and the organic reactions to synthesize or to transform these molecules in a synthetic laboratory or inside cells. The course will also focus on the functions that the structures and reactivities of the biomolecules encode. Enzymes, a special group of proteins will also be introduced to the audience, together with cofactors and coenzymes as one example of proteins possessing catalytic power. Module 2 will include current technologies developed in chemical biology, and selected research projects in this field, including literature review and guest lectures based on the knowledge delivered in the first two parts. Module 3 will be guest lectures in chemical biology. Through this course, students will be able to apply their chemistry knowledge to complicated biological molecules, to comprehend chemical biology research, and to identify/solve chemical biology problems.",
