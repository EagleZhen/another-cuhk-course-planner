The application of these theories and knowledge in early childhood education institutions will be illustrated in three levels: the social, school and individual level. First, rationales of accountability and quality assurance mechanism, data driven school improvement and matters in preparation for school self-evaluation and external review are examined. Second, the implementation of school-based management such as resource management, professional development of teachers and team building are discussed. Third, teacher professionalism and ways to equip early childhood practitioners with sufficient knowledge in order to fulfill their respective roles as school leaders or teacher leaders are presented. The course provides participants with conceptual knowledge in school management that serves as the basis of sustainable development of early childhood education institutions.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

Most importantly, evidence based interventions for young children with diverse needs, in particular, those with difficulties in cognitive, communication, early literacy, social, behavioral and emotional development will be discussed. The 3-tier support model and home-school collaboration will be emphasized in delivering the interventions for those children in needs.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.
