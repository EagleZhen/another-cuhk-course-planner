      "description": "(UGEA1212 is double-coded with GRMD1003.)  This course aims to introduce China’s cultural heritages from the perspective of cultural geography. As an important sub-discipline in human geography, cultural geography examines how people use space and develop it into places – a process of cultural landscape formation. “Space” here is nothing immutable or monolithic; instead, individuals, groups, civilizations and their culture “craft” characteristic places through interactions with the surrounding environment and specific political and economic systems (themselves determined by culture). China provides numerous extraordinary examples to illustrate these topics. The course includes four key components: 1) the theoretical foundation: fundamentals of cultural geography; 2) the legacies and regional variations of China’s cultural heritages; 3) topical issues about China’s cultural heritages; 4) the cultural convergence in aspects of globalization and cultural transformation. The course provides not only a body of knowledge about the cultural landscape and spatial variations of places in China, but also an understanding of their major transformations that have taken place in a globalizing world.",

This will reshape the socio-economic relations and the urban landscapes of the three places. Studying the changing relations of Hong Kong, Macao and the PRD will not only help students understand the dynamic socio-economic development of the Greater Bay Area as a rapidly growing mega-city region in the world, but also capture the latest transformation of the region.

The course examines these complexities of nature and discusses the ways in which different societies have dealt with it. Over the history of human civilizations, different societies have taken very different approaches towards nature.

It begins with a general introduction to geography and its sub-fields, and is divided into four areas of concentration which constitute our undergraduate curriculum in geography and resource management. An issue-based approach is adopted to address a wide range of selected topics with important local, regional, national and global significance from geographical perspectives. After taking the course, students will not only gain basic understanding of geographical concepts, principles and applications, but also become familiar with our curriculum and learning resources in their undergraduate study. All major students are required to take this introductory course and assigned to our teaching staff for academic advising.",

This field trip course is held during term breaks under the supervision of one or more faculty members or invited trip leaders. The theme of the field trip can be relevant to the Concentration Area(s) under geography and resource management.

The first part of the course will cover the general introductory concepts and provide students with theoretical and historical background of the discipline. This will be followed by in-depth study of specific environmental settings and resource issues that will complement our understanding of ecotourism. Hong Kong is the main focus of discussion though examples or cases in Mainland China and around the world are also provided throughout the course. Critical issues in ecotourism such as its multi-dimensional impacts, governance, planning, and resource and visitor management will also be covered. Lastly, students will be exposed to the relation of the phenomenon of ecotourism and the concept of sustainable tourism. Some of the lectures will address SDGs, for example, Goals 12, 16 and 17 embrace the knowledge and evolution of environmentalism and nature-human relationship; Goals 14 and 15 connect with the concept of protected areas and environmental conservation; Goals 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 12 and 13 cover multi-dimensional tourism impacts and, more importantly, climate change issue. The concept of sustainable development will frame and conclude the entire course since the concepts has played an indispensable role in tourism development nowadays.",

In an era of globalization, the regional and national aspects of growth are continuously contested through both spatial (e.g. areas, their interactions and relationship with other areas) and aspatial (e.g. institutional and political factors) processes. This course will provide an overview of key economic-geographical theories and concepts in analyzing economic processes at various geographical scales. To this end, the relationships between space, economy and society will be discussed using a number of cases. Topics cover globalization and local development, and how they work together to shape spatial organization and economic change, location of production and transnational corporations, and spatial interaction and network. The course provides an excellent vehicle toward understanding today’s increasingly interdependent world.",

This approach to development should not only generate economic growth, but also distribute its benefits equitably, regenerate the environment rather than destroy it, as well as empower people rather than marginalize them. The UN 2030 Agenda came into effect in 2015 promising to “interlink and integrate” Sustainable Development Goals in an attempt to implement solutions facing humanity. Sustainable development goals are an all-inclusive invitation to act to end poverty, secure the planet and ensure that all people appreciate peace and prosperity.This course introduces the concept of sustainable development, the evolution of models and the implicit assumptions they make, as well as their contradictions. It also traces the advent of the SDGs and the extent that they support the principles of sustainable development. We examine the emergence of environmental problems and critically review the institutional responses to these problems since the late 1960s. We then consider in detail the increasingly popular idea of efforts in the pursuit of the SDGs from different perspectives that centres around people, planet, prosperity, peace and the partnerships involved in achieving the goals. The lectures will explore how achieving sustainable development goals will depends much on effective planning and good governance. Examples from different parts of the world will be used to underline the tight inter-connections between processes in different regions and across geographical scales in the context of sustainable development.",

However, rising energy consumption also raises serious environmental challenges that are detrimental to human beings and our planet Earth. Accordingly, one critical goal of energy development is to maximize the positive impacts and to minimize the negative impacts of energy consumption. After discussing the role of energy consumption in a society, this course will analyze how energy consumption and the environment affect each other. Students will then be guided through various levels of a society, from individuals, households, communities, to cities, countries and the world in general discussion and case studies on how energy is consumed. Recognizing the importance of energy conservation as a key solution, this course will further examine two major barriers, particularly the behavior and efficiency gaps, to understand how we could achieve the goal.

      "description": "This course introduces scientific research methods and skills in geography. It aims to offer an integrative and broad introduction to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of geographic research. The course covers hands-on issues in planning and implementing research, such as generating research ideas and justifying research topics, using library resources, establishing theoretical framework, selecting the research design and sampling standard, conducting fieldwork, collecting data, and analysing and presenting the results. In addition, this course also discusses the principles in evaluating the quality of a research. This course is organized into three modules. The first module introduces how a research topic and its relevant questions are set up, how to use the existing literature and various geographic theories to frame a research, and how to design fieldwork and sampling schemes. The second module introduces the qualitative methods in geographical research, such as conducting fieldwork, collecting and analyzing data, writing research findings, and dealing with ethical concerns. The third module covers quantitative methods in geographical research, such as data types and sources, sampling methods, questionnaire design, non-parametric tests, and analysis of variation (ANOVA).",

      "description": "Map is an important tool to communicate spatial information based on which rational decisions can be made. Many geographic information system (GIS) related assignments are to produce maps, i.e. to present spatial data, process, and analytical results in form of map products. Cartographic knowledge and technique is a type of grammar that allows for the effective design and production of quality maps and other visual products. However, in recent decades, the process of map production is changing from supply to demand-driven and the function of maps emphasizes more on exploratory capability. Cartographers follow stipulated methods and techniques while incorporation of new ideas due to the emergent paradigm shift becomes equally important in map production. By adopting the five-step design thinking process, meaningful and innovative ideas can be generated in creating better maps for visual communication and exploration.This course introduces the principles of cartography and design thinking process. Fundamental concepts of cartography include map projection and conventional map design theories such as colour theory, symbolization and map design will be covered in the first part of the course. The design thinking process including empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test is introduced and practiced associated with a map-making problem that is going to be solved by students in group. This course is taught with lectures, laboratories and interactive class activities. Lectures are designed to cover important theoretical concepts while the laboratories are implemented to provide students hands-on experience and skills on cartographic presentation and visualization using several software tools. Design thinking ideology is penetrated through the process of map production.",

      "description": "Our modern society is built on modern energy consumption. However, rising energy consumption also raises serious environmental challenges that are detrimental to human beings and our planet Earth. On one hand, energy is a key foundation of our modern way of life. Electricity illuminates and operates the world. Modern transportation systems are energy intensive. The consumption of natural gas for cooking avoids indoor air pollution that is causing over one million premature deaths in poor countries. On the other hand, energy also creates many problems, such as air pollution, excessive water consumption and pollution, and most importantly, global climate change. Energy plays a crucial role in shaping the current global financial system through the petrodollar system, but also has frequently casted shadows on geopolitical and sometimes military conflicts. With a great majority of global CO2 emissions under national/regional carbon neutrality (or net zero) commitments, our utilization of energy resources will go through fundamental reforms. The ongoing energy transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewables is exerting profound influences on economic development, technological transformation and geopolitical disputes. This course aims to guide students through a wide and interconnected array of real-world topics covering energy consumption, fossil fuels and non-fossil resources, and especially their impacts on and from carbon neutrality. Students are not required to have prior exposure to the field but should be open-minded in analyzing issues from alternative perspectives. The course will be taught from an interdisciplinary approach according to the nature of topics.",

Recently, there is a call for an ecological approach to replace the rigid engineering and technological approach to solve the world’s environmental problems in a more sustainable manner. This course will introduce the principles and practice of ecological engineering in restoring disturbed ecosystems and creating new ecosystems that provide benefits to both humans and the environment, using a combination of global and local case studies. Students will integrate the knowledge of ecology and other fields of physical geography, e.g. hydrology and soil science, to examine holistically the influence of natural and anthropogenic perturbations on the structure and functions of terrestrial, wetland and aquatic ecosystems. Field trips will be conducted to enhance the students’ learning experience and technical skills in an outdoor setting.",

Environmental planning plays a vital role in urban design and the formulation of land use and other planning strategies in order to mitigate the effects of human activities on air, water, land, and ecological systems, and to promote sustainable use of energy, water and other natural resources. While the coverage is broad and comprehensive, emphasis will be placed on the two most prominent tools, i.e. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), in terms of their origins, legal and regulatory requirements, and practices around the world. After introducing the conceptual framework and theoretical foundation of environmental assessment, specific methods and techniques (both qualitative and quantitative) will be introduced for students to understand the procedures and systems and gain the technical skills for practical applications. Environmental planning considerations and impact assessment will be examined for different sectors (industry, commercial, transportation, etc.) and multiple environmental media (air, water, solid waste, and noise) at difference spatial scales (local, regional, and national). Although a global perspective and comparative approach will be adopted throughout the course, examples and case studies of mitigating and managing environmental impacts through planning and assessment will mainly come from Hong Kong and mainland China.",

The collected data are so massive and varied, coined as “Big Data”, that require novel techniques to store, process and analyse to support various applications in urban areas with a view to improve people’s lives in cities. This course is divided into two parts. The first part will introduce the fundamental concepts, methods and platforms to analyse urban big data. The second part will discuss the application of big data in various urban topics including urban planning, transportation, energy, extreme events and public health issues.
