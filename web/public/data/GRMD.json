As an important sub-discipline in human geography, cultural geography examines how people use space and develop it into places – a process of cultural landscape formation. “Space” here is nothing immutable or monolithic; instead, individuals, groups, civilizations and their culture “craft” characteristic places through interactions with the surrounding environment and specific political and economic systems (themselves determined by culture). China provides numerous extraordinary examples to illustrate these topics. The course includes four key components: 1) the theoretical foundation: fundamentals of cultural geography; 2) the legacies and regional variations of China’s cultural heritages; 3) topical issues about China’s cultural heritages; 4) the cultural convergence in aspects of globalization and cultural transformation. The course provides not only a body of knowledge about the cultural landscape and spatial variations of places in China, but also an understanding of their major transformations that have taken place in a globalizing world.",

After completing the course, students will be able to: * adopt a normative stance in evaluating the cultural landscapes; * identify essential features of China’s cultural heritages from the lens of cultural geography; * understand Chinese cultural heritages’ multiple dimensions and geographical variations, and how these factors shape and reinforce space, place and cultural formation; * discover cases or use experiences to describe and diagnose how the development of Chinese cultural heritages is associated with forces at different geographical scales such as local, regional, national and even global scales; * organize their ideas and information under the framework of cultural geography; and * explain their ideas in a communicative manner to promote Chinese culture. |\n| --- |",
      "course_syllabus": "As shown below, the course contents will be divided into 4 parts and 12 topics.\n\nPart I: Fundamental of Cultural Geography: Interpreting Places and Spaces of Cultural Heritages (3 lectures):\n\nThis component covers key theories and concepts developed over the past 30 years in cultural geography (both classical and new cultural geography approaches), and explain why cultural geography offers a very unique but important approach to study China’s cultural heritages. Theoretical exploration will help bring out ideas about space, place, power, cultural landscape, and identity. How people use space and develop it into place will be discussed. Many examples will be used to help students understand the approaches of cultural geography.\n\n1. Introduction: cultural geography as an approach\n\n文化地理方法导读\n\n2. Culture, space, place and power\n\n文化、空間、地方與權力\n\n3. Shaping of China’s cultural landscape: traditions, foreign imports, and globalization\n\n中国文化景觀的形成：傳統、外來影響與全球化\n\nPart II: Cultural Heritages and Regional Variations (5 lectures)\n\nIn the first three weeks, the course has laid the theoretical foundation. Now, student will begin their journey of understanding the subject matter, with a focus on several key cultural regions in China. The aim of this component is to covey a deep sense of place as an integral system engaging multiple force, e.g. myth and legend, power and politics, history and tradition, religion and symbol, nature and geography, cultural practices, and society’s interconnection with the environment. Students will make a good sense of a wide geographical variation of Chinese cultural values and practices.\n\n4. Beijing: Beijing Culture and the place of politics\n\n北京：京派文化與空間的政治\n\n5. Shanghai: Shanghai Culture and the place for spatial competition\n\n上海：海派文化與空間的爭奪\n\n6. Southwest: Ethnic culture and the place of ethnicity\n\n西南：民族文化與鄉土空間\n\n7. Tibet: Religious culture and the place of belief\n\n西藏：宗教文化與信仰空間\n\n8. Lingnan: Lingnan culture and the place of diversity\n\n嶺南：嶺南文化與多元空間\n\nPart III: China’s Cultural Imprints and Dynamics: Topical Issues (3 lectures)\n\nThe aim of this component is to let students further appreciate the diversified studies of cultural geography by introducing several topical issues.\n\n9. Ancient villages: A place of spatial representation\n\n古村落的空間意象\n\n10. The cultures of production and workspace\n\n生産的文化與勞動場所\n\n11. Graffiti: the cultural geography of Youth in China\n\n塗鴉：青年文化地理\n\nPart IV: Cultural Convergence and Transformation (Globalization) (1 lecture)\n\nGlobalization is an unescapable trend, and this powerful trend has greatly impacted on China’s cultural heritages. The cultural convergence and transformation will be discussed. The focus is not simply to interpret convergence as some kind of loss of unique characteristics of our cultural tradition. Rather, we wish to stress that when one gets involved in intercultural interaction, one should be likely to become aware of and even enhance one’s cultural tradition. Problems and local responses in cultural heritage conservation in China will be explored.\n\n12.

      "description": "This course looks at the interplay between the natural and human aspects of the world’s regions. Planet Earth is a complex system with diverse climatic zones, landforms, geology, soils, vegetation and habitats; the processes and forces leading to their evolution and formation are different in both spatial and temporal scales. The course examines these complexities of nature and discusses the ways in which different societies have dealt with it. Over the history of human civilizations, different societies have taken very different approaches towards nature. This is reflected in different aspects of social institutions (political, economic, social, cultural, religious, etc.) that human beings have created to organize themselves.",

      "description": "This course aims to introduce students to geography as a multi-faceted discipline with diverse fields, as well as its relationships with and contributions to the studies of resource management, social and environmental issues. It begins with a general introduction to geography and its sub-fields, and is divided into four areas of concentration which constitute our undergraduate curriculum in geography and resource management. An issue-based approach is adopted to address a wide range of selected topics with important local, regional, national and global significance from geographical perspectives. After taking the course, students will not only gain basic understanding of geographical concepts, principles and applications, but also become familiar with our curriculum and learning resources in their undergraduate study. All major students are required to take this introductory course and assigned to our teaching staff for academic advising.",

      "description": "Field studies are an integral part of the study of geography and resource management. The benefits of field studies are enhanced by a study trip to a destination outside of Hong Kong. The objectives are three-fold: (1) to broaden students’ horizons and knowledge base through exposure to a different and less familiar environment outside Hong Kong; (2) to enable students to make comparative studies across different countries or regions; and (3) to provide an opportunity for students to interact with non-local scholars and students in the same discipline. This field trip course is held during term breaks under the supervision of one or more faculty members or invited trip leaders. The theme of the field trip can be relevant to the Concentration Area(s) under geography and resource management. Students are required to participate in all activities throughout the course and submit individual and/or group-based assignments.",

This will be followed by in-depth study of specific environmental settings and resource issues that will complement our understanding of ecotourism. Hong Kong is the main focus of discussion though examples or cases in Mainland China and around the world are also provided throughout the course. Critical issues in ecotourism such as its multi-dimensional impacts, governance, planning, and resource and visitor management will also be covered. Lastly, students will be exposed to the relation of the phenomenon of ecotourism and the concept of sustainable tourism. Some of the lectures will address SDGs, for example, Goals 12, 16 and 17 embrace the knowledge and evolution of environmentalism and nature-human relationship; Goals 14 and 15 connect with the concept of protected areas and environmental conservation; Goals 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 12 and 13 cover multi-dimensional tourism impacts and, more importantly, climate change issue. The concept of sustainable development will frame and conclude the entire course since the concepts has played an indispensable role in tourism development nowadays.",

Students will acquire basic knowledge of ecotourism development and its potential and can be capable of making judgment in response to critical issues on conservation and natural resource management. Since ecotourism, sustainable tourism and sustainable development (including SDGs) are inter-connected concepts in theoretical and practical perspectives, students are expected to incorporate and integrate these areas of knowledge with various cases and examples provided in the course. Specifically, after successfully completing this course, students will be able to: - Understand the basic concepts of ecotourism and its relation with the overall tourism industry; especially connecting ecotourism with sustainable tourism development; - Acquire knowledge in operating and managing ecotourism activities; and particularly how these ecotourism activities may impact economic, socio-cultural and ecological/environmental sustainability; - Develop an understanding and the skills and approaches necessary for interpreting relevant policy and planning of natural and man-made resources for (eco)tourism; and - Enhance problem-solving capability using an integrative approach and critical thinking as introduced in the course, which draws students’ attention to how tourism and ecotourism may contribute to SDGs potentially |\n| --- |",

      "description": "Understanding uneven global development is an important agenda in geography and politics alike. In an era of globalization, the regional and national aspects of growth are continuously contested through both spatial (e.g. areas, their interactions and relationship with other areas) and aspatial (e.g. institutional and political factors) processes. This course will provide an overview of key economic-geographical theories and concepts in analyzing economic processes at various geographical scales. To this end, the relationships between space, economy and society will be discussed using a number of cases. Topics cover globalization and local development, and how they work together to shape spatial organization and economic change, location of production and transnational corporations, and spatial interaction and network. The course provides an excellent vehicle toward understanding today’s increasingly interdependent world.",

      "description": "(UGEC2171 is double-coded with GRMD2401.)\n\nSustainable development is a global vision for the future. This approach to development should not only generate economic growth, but also distribute its benefits equitably, regenerate the environment rather than destroy it, as well as empower people rather than marginalize them.\n\nThe UN 2030 Agenda came into effect in 2015 promising to “interlink and integrate” Sustainable Development Goals in an attempt to implement solutions facing humanity. Sustainable development goals are an all-inclusive invitation to act to end poverty, secure the planet and ensure that all people appreciate peace and prosperity.\nThis course introduces the concept of sustainable development, the evolution of models and the implicit assumptions they make, as well as their contradictions. It also traces the advent of the SDGs and the extent that they support the principles of sustainable development. We examine the emergence of environmental problems and critically review the institutional responses to these problems since the late 1960s. We then consider in detail the increasingly popular idea of efforts in the pursuit of the SDGs from different perspectives that centres around people, planet, prosperity, peace and the partnerships involved in achieving the goals. The lectures will explore how achieving sustainable development goals will depends much on effective planning and good governance. Examples from different parts of the world will be used to underline the tight inter-connections between processes in different regions and across geographical scales in the context of sustainable development.",

The course will specifically be useful to students interested in understanding the issues associated with use and misuse of natural resources. Lectures, field trips, seminars and study assignments will be used to focus attention and help analyze natural resources according to biotic resources, physical and earth resources and the social sciences, by identifying principles and practices used to organize natural resources for human use. Understanding these principles will allow for environmentally sound management of natural resources. The understanding of the physical and earth resources will facilitate the prudent management of resources such as land, water, waste. Applying social sciences systems of inquiry will prepare students for understanding the management, administration and policy issues that could affect humanities use of natural resources, globally, regionally and locally.",

It will examine the history and development of nature conservation in Hong Kong including legislation, designation and management of the protected areas. Specifically, country, marine parks and geopark are developed to protected terrestrial and marine habitats as well as the associated wildlife, and geodiversity, respectively. Threats and problems facing existing protected areas will be discussed. Nature conservation will be addressed through lectures, field trips and students’ projects. It will also introduce concepts and principles of nature conservation in the local and global context, including climate change, ecosystem services, geo-conservation and the global conservation efforts such as the World Summit and Convention of Biodiversity. The course helps students look at nature conservation from the perspective of sustainable development, incorporating the environmental, social and economic dimensions of development, focusing on SDG Goals 14 and 15 in particular. Both SDGs are directly linked to nature conservation efforts, focusing on preserving natural resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity, which are vital for the health of our planet, ensuring sustainable fishing/forest management practices for the benefit of communities.",

      "description": "The historical evolution of the human society is significantly affected by how we consume energy. Our modern society is built on modern energy consumption patterns. However, rising energy consumption also raises serious environmental challenges that are detrimental to human beings and our planet Earth. Accordingly, one critical goal of energy development is to maximize the positive impacts and to minimize the negative impacts of energy consumption. After discussing the role of energy consumption in a society, this course will analyze how energy consumption and the environment affect each other. Students will then be guided through various levels of a society, from individuals, households, communities, to cities, countries and the world in general discussion and case studies on how energy is consumed. Recognizing the importance of energy conservation as a key solution, this course will further examine two major barriers, particularly the behavior and efficiency gaps, to understand how we could achieve the goal. An open and especially active mind is a must for success in this course.",

      "description": "This course introduces scientific research methods and skills in geography. It aims to offer an integrative and broad introduction to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of geographic research. The course covers hands-on issues in planning and implementing research, such as generating research ideas and justifying research topics, using library resources, establishing theoretical framework, selecting the research design and sampling standard, conducting fieldwork, collecting data, and analysing and presenting the results. In addition, this course also discusses the principles in evaluating the quality of a research. This course is organized into three modules. The first module introduces how a research topic and its relevant questions are set up, how to use the existing literature and various geographic theories to frame a research, and how to design fieldwork and sampling schemes. The second module introduces the qualitative methods in geographical research, such as conducting fieldwork, collecting and analyzing data, writing research findings, and dealing with ethical concerns. The third module covers quantitative methods in geographical research, such as data types and sources, sampling methods, questionnaire design, non-parametric tests, and analysis of variation (ANOVA).",

      "description": "Map is an important tool to communicate spatial information based on which rational decisions can be made. Many geographic information system (GIS) related assignments are to produce maps, i.e. to present spatial data, process, and analytical results in form of map products. Cartographic knowledge and technique is a type of grammar that allows for the effective design and production of quality maps and other visual products. However, in recent decades, the process of map production is changing from supply to demand-driven and the function of maps emphasizes more on exploratory capability. Cartographers follow stipulated methods and techniques while incorporation of new ideas due to the emergent paradigm shift becomes equally important in map production. By adopting the five-step design thinking process, meaningful and innovative ideas can be generated in creating better maps for visual communication and exploration.\n\nThis course introduces the principles of cartography and design thinking process. Fundamental concepts of cartography include map projection and conventional map design theories such as colour theory, symbolization and map design will be covered in the first part of the course. The design thinking process including empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test is introduced and practiced associated with a map-making problem that is going to be solved by students in group. This course is taught with lectures, laboratories and interactive class activities. Lectures are designed to cover important theoretical concepts while the laboratories are implemented to provide students hands-on experience and skills on cartographic presentation and visualization using several software tools. Design thinking ideology is penetrated through the process of map production.",

      "description": "Contemporary economic processes, such as the globalization of trade and the emergence of economic blocs, have been accompanied by significant growth in the movements of people and freight. This course provides a broad introduction to transport geography. Basic ideas in sustainable development will be related to the provision of infrastructure and services of transport and logistics at various geographical scales, and to the development of different modes of transport. The course will provide students with a foundation for more advanced treatments of the subject.",

      "description": "Our modern society is built on modern energy consumption. However, rising energy consumption also raises serious environmental challenges that are detrimental to human beings and our planet Earth. On one hand, energy is a key foundation of our modern way of life. Electricity illuminates and operates the world. Modern transportation systems are energy intensive. The consumption of natural gas for cooking avoids indoor air pollution that is causing over one million premature deaths in poor countries. On the other hand, energy also creates many problems, such as air pollution, excessive water consumption and pollution, and most importantly, global climate change. Energy plays a crucial role in shaping the current global financial system through the petrodollar system, but also has frequently casted shadows on geopolitical and sometimes military conflicts. With a great majority of global CO2 emissions under national/regional carbon neutrality (or net zero) commitments, our utilization of energy resources will go through fundamental reforms. The ongoing energy transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewables is exerting profound influences on economic development, technological transformation and geopolitical disputes.\n\nThis course aims to guide students through a wide and interconnected array of real-world topics covering energy consumption, fossil fuels and non-fossil resources, and especially their impacts on and from carbon neutrality. Students are not required to have prior exposure to the field but should be open-minded in analyzing issues from alternative perspectives. The course will be taught from an interdisciplinary approach according to the nature of topics.",

It aims to present an overview and analysis of human settlement, planning and policy in relation to natural hazards in the light of their socio-economic impacts. Major geological, meteorological, hydrological, and ecological hazards will be addressed from physical science perspective. The interaction between nature, society, and technology will be analysed as we discuss how people and places experience and cope with natural hazards in terms of risk assessment, reduction of vulnerability, and disaster mitigation and management, etc. While the coverage will be broad and global, case studies of threats, occurrence and consequences of natural hazards in Hong Kong and Mainland China will be emphasized.",

      "description": "With increasing human population and diminishing natural resources, environmental degradation is a growing concern globally. Recently, there is a call for an ecological approach to replace the rigid engineering and technological approach to solve the world’s environmental problems in a more sustainable manner. This course will introduce the principles and practice of ecological engineering in restoring disturbed ecosystems and creating new ecosystems that provide benefits to both humans and the environment, using a combination of global and local case studies. Students will integrate the knowledge of ecology and other fields of physical geography, e.g. hydrology and soil science, to examine holistically the influence of natural and anthropogenic perturbations on the structure and functions of terrestrial, wetland and aquatic ecosystems. Field trips will be conducted to enhance the students’ learning experience and technical skills in an outdoor setting.",

      "description": "The course introduces and examines the theories, processes and methodologies of environmental planning and assessment as important tools and instruments for minimizing human impacts on the environment and achieving environmental sustainability through good governance. Environmental planning plays a vital role in urban design and the formulation of land use and other planning strategies in order to mitigate the effects of human activities on air, water, land, and ecological systems, and to promote sustainable use of energy, water and other natural resources. While the coverage is broad and comprehensive, emphasis will be placed on the two most prominent tools, i.e. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), in terms of their origins, legal and regulatory requirements, and practices around the world. After introducing the conceptual framework and theoretical foundation of environmental assessment, specific methods and techniques (both qualitative and quantitative) will be introduced for students to understand the procedures and systems and gain the technical skills for practical applications. Environmental planning considerations and impact assessment will be examined for different sectors (industry, commercial, transportation, etc.) and multiple environmental media (air, water, solid waste, and noise) at difference spatial scales (local, regional, and national). Although a global perspective and comparative approach will be adopted throughout the course, examples and case studies of mitigating and managing environmental impacts through planning and assessment will mainly come from Hong Kong and mainland China.",

      "description": "Urban areas, where nearly 70% of world’s population is projected to live and thrive in 2050, rely on loads of data to run smoothly every day. The concept of smart city brings together the innovative use and management of data and advancement of computational technology. The collected data are so massive and varied, coined as “Big Data”, that require novel techniques to store, process and analyse to support various applications in urban areas with a view to improve people’s lives in cities. This course is divided into two parts. The first part will introduce the fundamental concepts, methods and platforms to analyse urban big data. The second part will discuss the application of big data in various urban topics including urban planning, transportation, energy, extreme events and public health issues. Students will be equipped with knowledge and skills on big data analytics to deal with real-world challenges.",
