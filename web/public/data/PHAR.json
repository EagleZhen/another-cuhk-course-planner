Verbal and written communication skills are crucial in drug information in order for such information to be disseminated effectively. To emphasize these areas, students are expected to communicate with patients through drug counseling, with the public by conducting educational programs, and with other health care professionals and colleagues during therapeutic use evaluation. Utilizing the School of Pharmacy’s On-Line Drug-Enquiry Platform (AMPOULE), the clerkship exposes students to the many different types of questions from real patients who expect high quality and professional advice.",
