In terms of psycholinguistics, course content will examine the relationship between cognition, cognitive development and language; the stages, processes, and roles that affective factors play in first- and second-language acquisition. This course will also introduce sociolinguistics and study the ways in which groups of people use language, examining the close intertwining between a language and the social context in which it is used. Bilingualism and bilingual education in different contexts will be examined, with particular reference to Hong Kong. Aspects of language variation and dialects, societal bilingualism and multilingualism, language and power, and language policy and planning issues, together with the function of the second language and principles underlying the use of English as a medium of instruction in Hong Kong will also be covered.",

The course will look at the development of ICT in terms of the hardware and software available generally (as general-purpose software) or specifically for CALL. The course will examine the use of The Internet for computer-mediated communication such as email, chat programs and bulletin boards. Apart from standalone uses, the course will examine how ICT may be integrated into the broader language curriculum. Other issues covered will be ICT for teachers’ language development, for language research and the use of ICT in assessment.",
