This two-course series on special needs is designed to enhance the professional capacity of EP Trainees in collaborating with teachers and parents to facilitate the personal, social and educational development of students with diverse needs. Drawing on recent research developments, these courses attempt to demystify misconceptions in findings related to special needs. They show how the latest research improves our understanding of the mechanisms underlying different kinds of special needs and discuss the implications of these empirical studies for developing effective interventions. In this course, we introduce the contextual foundation for understanding students with diverse needs by looking at their families and schools. We then focus on the needs and characteristics of children and adolescents with different intellectual and learning abilities or disabilities. In particular, we examine topics related to global cognitive impairment, developmental delay, specific learning difficulties, and individuals who are gifted and talented.",

There will be administration, scoring, interpretation and report writing on some of the widely used instruments in Hong Kong. This course will also enable students to develop knowledge and skills to use academic-based achievement measures in school settings for students with specific learning difficulties or exceptional abilities, and discusses curriculum issues that are closely linked to the choice of measures and understanding of test scores. Overall, this course emphasizes the importance of collecting and using comprehensive data on individual’s cognitive functioning to make evidence-based decisions for effective intervention.",
