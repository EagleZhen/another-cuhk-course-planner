      "description": "This course provides an introduction to broad themes, key concepts, and major theories used to understand the global political economy, and how national political-economies fit into the global system. In the first half, we will cover a bit of methodology and the philosophy of science of political economy, the history of the global political-economic system, contemporary controversies, and possible futures. In the second half, we will cover the major theories that scholars have constructed to make sense of the global political economy, including economic nationalism or realism, liberalism, and critical theories. Having prior knowledge of international relations scholarship or economics will help, but is not strictly necessary. The aim of this course is to provide an intellectual foundation for understanding how the world system operates, and for further, more specialized studies in the many areas that GPE covers.",

      "description": "The Currency War that erupted in 2010 has weaken the financial foundation of the world’s advanced economies and eroded the currency functions of the three global currencies (the USD, Euro and Japanese yen), or G3 currencies. This has given the Chinese renminbi a window of opportunity to rise and challenge the global dominance of the G3 currencies. This is a structural change that will shake up the global political economy and monetary system in the decades to come by adding a new player – China – to the future currency war. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping is pushing through structural reforms to chase his \"Chinese Dream\" when the global powers are repositioning to accommodate the renminbi in the global system. The course will encompass the past, present and future aspects of the currency war by integrating China’s development in the global currency war environment. It will prepare students for understanding the coming changes in Mainland China and how they will affect the global monetary system and political economy. The course will start with some basic economic concepts that are needed to understand the economics part of the course. It will use the currency war development to explain the rise of the renminbi, the political and economic challenges behind the opening up of China and the evolution of China's policy and financial development in shaping the future of the world economy.",

      "description": "Energy drives the modern world. The availability of cheap and plentiful energy such as fossil fuels and nuclear energy has transformed every aspect of human civilization. Electricity and petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and petrochemical products are essential to the well-functioning of a world economy, and its availability key to lifting a country out of poverty. News headlines are often dominated by energy issues which include energy shortages and disruptions, spiking gasoline and diesel prices at the pump, acute electricity generation crisis in many developed countries, and unaffordable energy prices for developing countries, all with highly relevant political and economic consequences. Global energy instability is likely to be a paramount political issue of our time in the foreseeable future. This course aims to provide a rigorous and systemic overview and understanding of global energy markets, one of the most complex and capital-intensive economic systems in the world. This course teaches the basic language of energy and its measurements; supply/demand balance and what it means; how the various energy markets work and their interconnectedness; issues driving energy market trends and disruptions; and the critical and emerging issues that will impact these markets. This course offers a balanced and realistic understanding of energy issues, primarily with fact and data-based information and insights, aided by the introduction of powerful frameworks to help illuminate these topics and challenge conventional wisdom or myths. The course aims to enlighten understanding and discussion of energy market issues that will continue to dominate news headlines. Students should have an open mind and be creative. Active participation in class discussion is highly encouraged. Never hesitate to interrupt the instructor in the classroom. The instructor welcomes questions and appreciates challenges. The hope is that students will have fun in taking the course and get more interested in the topics after one semester.",

As an introductory course, no prior knowledge is strictly required, although prior study in social psychology will be helpful.

      "description": "The world is currently faced with many complex and interrelated socio-economic challenges that cannot be solved effectively either by government effort or market forces. Welfare services struggle to cope with budgetary constraints. 1.3 billion people are still living in the dark without electricity. 345 million people in 82 countries are facing acute food insecurity. When existing political economy framework doesn’t seem to be able to tackle these issues, we need new and innovative strategies to address the unmet social needs.Social innovation is the “reconfiguring of social practices, in response to societal challenges, which seeks to enhance outcomes on societal well-being and necessarily includes the engagement of civil society actors”. It intends to transform sustainably existing institutions, power structure, and social relations from a bottom-up collective agency approach. A successful social innovation is supposed to be more effective, efficient and sustainable in creating a community resilient to challenges that is based on social justice and mutual respect and through citizen involvement. It is a community with new forms of collaboration, improved capabilities, more equal power relations, and a better use of societal resources. If social innovation is embedded in our societies, our social life, in the end, will be transformed.By the end of the course, students should have a good understanding of the basic principles of social innovation. You will be able to complete a social innovation proposal and accomplish the following tasks: 1) to understand how to analyze why certain social issues cannot be effectively solved; 2) to use knowledge and skills developed in class to design an innovative solution; 3) to provide critical peer evaluation on other groups’ projects; and 4) to have insights on how to embed social innovation in your future career.",

Students will be challenged to “connect the dots” between the current dysfunction which riddles the system and the mistaken assumptions and strategic miscalculations that have been made over the decades. Topics under discussion will include paralysis in the World Trade Organization, the rise of protectionism and “worker-centric” policies, trade fragmentation and so-called “friendshoring”, the challenges of rapid technological advancement and trade governance, the rise of the global South, and the points of trade friction between the US and China. By diving deeply into the root causes, students will gain a “real world” perspective on the trade issues dominating global headlines.",

      "description": "China has embarked her economic reforms since the late 1970s when Deng Xiaoping initiated the “Reform and Open Door” policy. The economic transformation over the last four decades has been remarkable and significant. The most notable one is the successful transformation of a centralized and a planned economy into a market (non-market) one. Moreover, China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002 to engage fully with the globalization trend. With these internal and external backdrops, contemporary Chinese society has been undergoing many changes, facing challenges and having abundant opportunities too. In this course, several contemporary salient issues will be focused such as higher education, inequality, migration, aging, corruption and health, among others. Their causes, problems, consequences and implications will be examined within the framework of state-society relationship.Last, but not least, discussions will be encouraged in the class. The dialogue should provide an excellent forum for students to engage in an active mode of learning. Ideas can be tested; points will be made, and, above all, judgements will be formed. This will further cultivate a sense of intellectual dialogue within a productive and an encouraging environment.",

      "description": "As the world’s second largest economy and biggest trading nation, China is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy to enhance its role in the global political economy. While the quasi-superpower’s goals are focused on attaining a bigger say in reshaping the international financial architecture, its voice is being heard on issues ranging from Free Trade Agreements and commodity prices to climate change and food security. Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, Beijing is packing a bigger punch in institutions and forums including the International Monetary Fund as well as the G20 and APEC. Moreover, the Xi administration is trying to buttress China’s global influence through overarching undertakings such as the “One Belt, One Road” or the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI) to nurture cross-border and inter-continental infrastructure projects. The Belt and Road grand plan will also showcase China’s aggressive Outbound Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI) strategy as well as the country’s leaps-and-bounds advancement in high technology. In the course of the teaching and discussion, ample weight will be given to the roles of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, which are substantial players within the “Greater China” universe. Apart from analyzing world-sized projects and activities involving the Belt and Road, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the G20 as well as UN institutions, this course will examine China’s relations with major countries and regions, particularly the U.S., Russia, Japan, the two Koreas, India, the ASEAN and EU from the global political-economy perspective. A common theme will be to appraise the extent to which Beijing can sell its “win-win” scenarios in trade, investment and security-related cooperation to global partners. The Xi administration, however, has to counter the “anti-China containment policy” supposedly being spearheaded by countries including the U.S., India, Japan, Vietnam and Australia. Beijing must also reassure developed countries that it is not stealing their technologies through M&A operations – and developing nations that it is not pursuing neo-colonialist agendas. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) administration’s ability to win over countries and regions and to enlarge its global footprint depends, however, on the viability of the “China model.” Whether China can modernize government institutions and corporate governance – and raise the competitiveness of its industrial and services sectors – is pivotal to its objective of becoming a norm-setter in the global political economy. These important issues will be analyzed and discussed in class after students have gained a good understanding of the Chinese economic structure, the country’s foreign-policy and national-security priorities, and latest developments in the global political economy.",

      "description": "Why do most societies around the world positively discriminate light-skinned, but negatively discriminate dark-skinned people? Why do social norms often restrict the freedoms of certain social identities, such as women? Why is the Global North rich but the Global South poor? This course tries to answer questions such as these by delving deeper into the roots of global inequality. In particular, it will focus on the interactive nature of the relationship between the individual (psychological level) and the social context that maintains social inequality. The course draws heavily from a multidisciplinary body of scholarship to shed light on the multilevel predictors of social inequality including, but not limited to, the global level (e.g., imperialism/(neo-)colonialism, globalization, the international media), the cultural level (e.g., neoliberalism, individualism/collectivism, racism/white supremacy), and the individual level (e.g., social dominance orientation, microaggressions, the self-concept), and how all levels mutually constitute each other. The course heavily emphasizes the Global North vs. South regional differences and attempts to highlight the subjective nature of unequal human relationships. As such, it adopts a critical approach that attempts to break with mainstream hegemonic conceptions of social inequality that often misrepresent it as natural, stable and fixed.",

Over the course of the semester, students will contribute to an ongoing research project (topics vary annually), by performing policy-relevant research, surveying/canvassing, and/or data analysis. Each student is assigned a supervisor who will provide instruction, guidance, and assistance during the internship period. Students are required to submit a final report demonstrating the knowledge outcomes attained: for instance, background knowledge acquisition, experience in practical application of theory, data gathering, and data analysis. The student’s performance will be evaluated on the basis of his/ her final report and the supervisor’s assessment. This course is most similar to Independent Research (GPEC5850); the primary difference is that the focus of this course is on applied research, working with a team and supervised by a leading member of the partnering organizations concerned, while the focus of Independent Research can be more theoretical (e.g., literature review and analysis/interpretation) and is done independently under the supervision of a member of the MGPE teaching staff.",
