      "description": "This course provides an introduction to broad themes, key concepts, and major theories used to understand the global political economy, and how national political-economies fit into the global system. In the first half, we will cover a bit of methodology and the philosophy of science of political economy, the history of the global political-economic system, contemporary controversies, and possible futures. In the second half, we will cover the major theories that scholars have constructed to make sense of the global political economy, including economic nationalism or realism, liberalism, and critical theories. Having prior knowledge of international relations scholarship or economics will help, but is not strictly necessary. The aim of this course is to provide an intellectual foundation for understanding how the world system operates, and for further, more specialized studies in the many areas that GPE covers.",

      "description": "The Currency War that erupted in 2010 has weaken the financial foundation of the world’s advanced economies and eroded the currency functions of the three global currencies (the USD, Euro and Japanese yen), or G3 currencies. This has given the Chinese renminbi a window of opportunity to rise and challenge the global dominance of the G3 currencies. This is a structural change that will shake up the global political economy and monetary system in the decades to come by adding a new player – China – to the future currency war. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping is pushing through structural reforms to chase his \"Chinese Dream\" when the global powers are repositioning to accommodate the renminbi in the global system.\n\nThe course will encompass the past, present and future aspects of the currency war by integrating China’s development in the global currency war environment. It will prepare students for understanding the coming changes in Mainland China and how they will affect the global monetary system and political economy.

      "description": "Energy drives the modern world. The availability of cheap and plentiful energy such as fossil fuels and nuclear energy has transformed every aspect of human civilization. Electricity and petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and petrochemical products are essential to the well-functioning of a world economy, and its availability key to lifting a country out of poverty. News headlines are often dominated by energy issues which include energy shortages and disruptions, spiking gasoline and diesel prices at the pump, acute electricity generation crisis in many developed countries, and unaffordable energy prices for developing countries, all with highly relevant political and economic consequences. Global energy instability is likely to be a paramount political issue of our time in the foreseeable future.\n\nThis course aims to provide a rigorous and systemic overview and understanding of global energy markets, one of the most complex and capital-intensive economic systems in the world. This course teaches the basic language of energy and its measurements; supply/demand balance and what it means; how the various energy markets work and their interconnectedness; issues driving energy market trends and disruptions; and the critical and emerging issues that will impact these markets.\n\nThis course offers a balanced and realistic understanding of energy issues, primarily with fact and data-based information and insights, aided by the introduction of powerful frameworks to help illuminate these topics and challenge conventional wisdom or myths. The course aims to enlighten understanding and discussion of energy market issues that will continue to dominate news headlines.\n\nStudents should have an open mind and be creative. Active participation in class discussion is highly encouraged. Never hesitate to interrupt the instructor in the classroom. The instructor welcomes questions and appreciates challenges. The hope is that students will have fun in taking the course and get more interested in the topics after one semester.",

      "description": "The world is currently faced with many complex and interrelated socio-economic challenges that cannot be solved effectively either by government effort or market forces. Welfare services struggle to cope with budgetary constraints. 1.3 billion people are still living in the dark without electricity. 345 million people in 82 countries are facing acute food insecurity. When existing political economy framework doesn’t seem to be able to tackle these issues, we need new and innovative strategies to address the unmet social needs.\n\nSocial innovation is the “reconfiguring of social practices, in response to societal challenges, which seeks to enhance outcomes on societal well-being and necessarily includes the engagement of civil society actors”. It intends to transform sustainably existing institutions, power structure, and social relations from a bottom-up collective agency approach. A successful social innovation is supposed to be more effective, efficient and sustainable in creating a community resilient to challenges that is based on social justice and mutual respect and through citizen involvement. It is a community with new forms of collaboration, improved capabilities, more equal power relations, and a better use of societal resources. If social innovation is embedded in our societies, our social life, in the end, will be transformed.\n\nBy the end of the course, students should have a good understanding of the basic principles of social innovation. You will be able to complete a social innovation proposal and accomplish the following tasks: 1) to understand how to analyze why certain social issues cannot be effectively solved; 2) to use knowledge and skills developed in class to design an innovative solution; 3) to provide critical peer evaluation on other groups’ projects; and 4) to have insights on how to embed social innovation in your future career.",

Students will be challenged to “connect the dots” between the current dysfunction which riddles the system and the mistaken assumptions and strategic miscalculations that have been made over the decades. Topics under discussion will include paralysis in the World Trade Organization, the rise of protectionism and “worker-centric” policies, trade fragmentation and so-called “friendshoring”, the challenges of rapid technological advancement and trade governance, the rise of the global South, and the points of trade friction between the US and China. By diving deeply into the root causes, students will gain a “real world” perspective on the trade issues dominating global headlines.",

      "description": "China has embarked her economic reforms since the late 1970s when Deng Xiaoping initiated the “Reform and Open Door” policy. The economic transformation over the last four decades has been remarkable and significant. The most notable one is the successful transformation of a centralized and a planned economy into a market (non-market) one. Moreover, China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002 to engage fully with the globalization trend. With these internal and external backdrops, contemporary Chinese society has been undergoing many changes, facing challenges and having abundant opportunities too. In this course, several contemporary salient issues will be focused such as higher education, inequality, migration, aging, corruption and health, among others. Their causes, problems, consequences and implications will be examined within the framework of state-society relationship.\nLast, but not least, discussions will be encouraged in the class. The dialogue should provide an excellent forum for students to engage in an active mode of learning. Ideas can be tested; points will be made, and, above all, judgements will be formed. This will further cultivate a sense of intellectual dialogue within a productive and an encouraging environment.",

      "description": "As the world’s second largest economy and biggest trading nation, China is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy to enhance its role in the global political economy. While the quasi-superpower’s goals are focused on attaining a bigger say in reshaping the international financial architecture, its voice is being heard on issues ranging from Free Trade Agreements and commodity prices to climate change and food security. Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, Beijing is packing a bigger punch in institutions and forums including the International Monetary Fund as well as the G20 and APEC. Moreover, the Xi administration is trying to buttress China’s global influence through overarching undertakings such as the “One Belt, One Road” or the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI) to nurture cross-border and inter-continental infrastructure projects. The Belt and Road grand plan will also showcase China’s aggressive Outbound Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI) strategy as well as the country’s leaps-and-bounds advancement in high technology. In the course of the teaching and discussion, ample weight will be given to the roles of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, which are substantial players within the “Greater China” universe.\n\nApart from analyzing world-sized projects and activities involving the Belt and Road, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the G20 as well as UN institutions, this course will examine China’s relations with major countries and regions, particularly the U.S., Russia, Japan, the two Koreas, India, the ASEAN and EU from the global political-economy perspective. A common theme will be to appraise the extent to which Beijing can sell its “win-win” scenarios in trade, investment and security-related cooperation to global partners. The Xi administration, however, has to counter the “anti-China containment policy” supposedly being spearheaded by countries including the U.S., India, Japan, Vietnam and Australia. Beijing must also reassure developed countries that it is not stealing their technologies through M&A operations – and developing nations that it is not pursuing neo-colonialist agendas.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) administration’s ability to win over countries and regions and to enlarge its global footprint depends, however, on the viability of the “China model.” Whether China can modernize government institutions and corporate governance – and raise the competitiveness of its industrial and services sectors – is pivotal to its objective of becoming a norm-setter in the global political economy. These important issues will be analyzed and discussed in class after students have gained a good understanding of the Chinese economic structure, the country’s foreign-policy and national-security priorities, and latest developments in the global political economy.",

A key understanding of China’s objectives and strategies ranging from reshaping the world’s financial order to boosting investments in intercontinental infrastructure projects will enable students to gain fresh perspectives on China’s fast-changing economic and political ties with international institutions as well as major countries and regions.\n\nAfter taking this course, students should be able to fully understand – and be able to form their own views on:\n• The goals of Chinese foreign and national-security policies; and ways in which Beijing seeks to play a bigger role in reshaping the international financial order;\n• China’s strategies of enhancing its leadership capacity in global institutions and forums;\n• Beijing’s ambitious projection of financial power through massive overseas investment as well as boosting inter-continental infrastructure projects;\n• The pros and cons of major policy agendas such as the Belt and Road Initiative – as well as formidable challenges that they face;\n• Chinese concerns and game plans regarding the formation of free trade zones and handling global issues such as climate change, commodity prices and food security;\n• The pillars of the “China model” and the quasi-superpower’s drive to promote innovation in government systems as well as the industrial and services sectors.\n\nStudents should be capable of not only making informed analysis but also formulating their own theories and hypotheses regarding the full range of topics. For example, students should use IR and global political economy theories to assess the degree of success of China’s financial and trade-related “great leap outward.” Such prognosis and prognostication should be based on references to latest journal and news publications, ideas introduced by the lecturer, as well as debates within classes among advocates of different viewpoints. Guest lecturers who are practitioners in the finance, think-tank, and diplomatic sectors might be invited to give talks to students.",
      "course_syllabus": "Topic 1. CHINA’S CONCERNS AND STRATEGIES IN MAJOR ARENAS OF THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY\nThe lecture and class discussion will focus on how China the fast-rising quasi-superpower is boosting its clout in the global political economy through major initiatives in diplomacy, national security, and international economics and finance.\nThe Xi Jinping administration's new priorities on different aspects of state security -- including financial, energy and environmental security -- will be examined. Particular attention will be paid to China’s diplomatic and economic relations with powers and blocs including the United States, the EU, Japan, Russia, ASEAN, and world bodies such as the UN, the IMF, and the G20.\n\nTopic 2. CHINA’S ECONOMICS-BASED DIPLOMACY AND OUTBOUND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (OFDI); THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE “BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE”\nBeijing has since the 2000s sought to use its economic heft and influence as diplomatic tools to improve its relations with \"peripheral states\" and great powers alike.\nThe Xi Jinping administration’s employment of economic inducements such as overseas development aid and outbound foreign direct investment (OFDI) will be studied. Discussion will be held over the execution of China's economics-based diplomacy in selected theatres such as ASEAN, Africa as well as the U.S. and the EU. Assessment will be made of the efficacy of the “One Belt, One Road” game plan.\nStudents are encouraged to make suggestions as to how Beijing can better utilize OFDI and related strategies to win friends and neutralize enemies. Emphasis will be put on agendas including securing reliable supplies of energy and other resources; procuring high technology; and marketing Chinese products and know-how including high-speed railways.\n\nTopic 3. FOCUS ON THE CHALLENGES OF THE “BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE”\nAn assessment of the significance of the Belt and Road Initiative in view of comparative global undertakings such as the Marshall Plan in post-WWII Europe. Questions will be asked about whether Beijing is shouldering most of the investment burden given lackluster response from the U.S. and the EU. Thorough appraisals will be made of the long-term viability of multi-billion-dollar projects in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, which bear the hallmark of overseas development aid (ODA). Also discussed will be foreign economists’ views that Beijing’s commitments to big projects in Asia and Africa will exacerbate China’s already serious debt problems. Comparisons will be made between the B&RI and the Asia African Growth Corridor sponsored by Japan and India.\n\nTopic 4. CHINA, THE G20 AND BEIJING’S EFFORTS TO RESHAPE THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE\nBeijing has since the global financial crisis of 2008 sought to play a more assertive role in reshaping the international financial architecture. The Xi administration's strategies and performance in global forums such as the G20 will be assessed. Students will be asked to discuss major Chinese goals ranging from promoting the global status of the renminbi to ensuring fair trade particularly with the developed world. Also analyzed will be Beijing efforts together with other BRICS members to ensure that major developing countries will have a bigger say in reforming the global financial infrastructure. The long-term significance of the Asian Infrastructure Development Bank – and its perceived challenges to the Asian Development Bank and the IMF – will be appraised.\n\nTopic 5. GLOBAL INTERACTIONS: FTAs, FOOD SECURITY, COMMODITY PRICING AND CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe lecture and discussion will focus on China the assertive international actor in areas including the formation of free trade agreements and trade pacts with countries ranging from ASEAN members to Central Asian states. Also analyzed will be China’s efforts in engaging in global solutions relating to urgent tasks such as boosting food supplies, reducing carbon emissions, and promoting green energy solutions. Comparisons will be made between the Beijing-initiated Regional Comprehensive Economic Pact (RCEP) and the half-defunct Transpacific Partnership (TPP) spearheaded by the Obama administration. Emphasis will be put on how Beijing can prove itself as a responsible stakeholder if not a leader in the solution of global problems and the provision of global public goods. The fact that the Trump administration has displayed an anti-globalization stance – and Washington’s pulling out of the Paris Accord – has afforded the Xi administration new opportunities of demonstrating China’s commitment to globalization and to becoming a rule-setter in international intercourse.\n\nTopic 6. THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE OF CHINA-U.S. RELATIONS\nAfter examining the voluminous literature (in both English and Chinese) on Sino-U.S. relations since WWII, this class will discuss new challenges on the trade and foreign-policy fronts in the Xi Jinping and Donald Trump administrations. The traditionally win-win, symbiotic economic ties between the two giants could be jeopardized by security challenges epitomized by the North Korea crisis. One example is whether Trump could use trade-related threats to force Beijing to use more forceful means to restrain Pyongyang’s nuclear program. Also analyzed will be the role of Taiwan in complicating Sino-U.S. relations from the global political-economy perspective.\n\nTopic 7. THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE OF CHINA-RUSSIAN RELATIONS\nThe lecture and class discussion will focus on the global political economy factors behind the quasi-alliance relationship between China and Russia. For geopolitical and security reasons, both leaderships have developed a strong bondage based on their mutual concern about countering the American threat. Relevant IR theories will be explored to discuss the common China-Russian front on the North Korean issue. Manifestations of China-Russia cooperation in the form of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization will be assessed. However, these two former Cold War\nadversaries also harbor deep-seated distrusts over issues such as China’s economic predominance: Central Asia, hitherto Russia’s backyard, has become a Chinese economic sphere of interest particularly in the wake of the R&BI.\n\nTopic 8. THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE OF CHINA’S RELATIONS WITH THE TWO KOREAS AND WITH JAPAN\nThe North Korean missile and nuclear crisis has thrown into sharp perspective the convoluted quadrangular relations between China, the two Koreas, and Japan. What are the historical – and geopolitical – reasons behind Beijing’s refusal to jettison or at least curtail its alliance relationship with the DPRK? Questions of history as well as disputes over several pieces of rocks (called the Diaoyus or Senkakus) have put obstacles in the way of a symbiotic economic relationship between China and Japan. Discussion will be informed by latest research on the rich but complicated traditions of China-Korean and China-Japanese ties.\n\nTopic 9. THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE OF CHINA-INDIAN RELATIONS\nDespite exceptionally fast growth in bilateral trade in the past decade, Beijing and New Delhi are locked in dispute over border rows – as well as suspicions of each other’s “containment policies.” China and India, however, are important members of the BRICS group, as well as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China-India ties thus offer plentiful illustration of the interaction of potential economic symbiosis juxtaposed against increasingly ferocious geopolitical contest.\n\nTopic 10. THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE OF CHINA-ASEAN RELATIONS\nChina scored a major victory on the global political economy front when the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled against her claims on the South China Sea in 2016 – and nothing seemed to happen. Most ASEAN states are beholden to China due to massive trade and investment benefits emanating from their “win-win scenarios” with China. That Beijing can still hang on to its claims relating to the “nine dash lines” demonstrates the limits of international law in restricting the behaviors of a rising quasi-superpower.\n\nTopic 11. THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE OF CHINA-EU RELATIONS\nAlthough French President Emmanuel Macron has warned against Chinese firms acquiring high-tech EU manufacturers, Beijing’s buying power – and geopolitical clout – is such that it is picking up not only tech companies but also ports and mines in Europe. Beijing is also accused of “divide and rule” tactics through its special relationship with the 16 central and east European members of the EU (the so-called “16+1 cooperation”). The class will examine the obstacles that Beijing faces in its effort to use its new-found affinity with the EU to hedge against “American neo-imperialism.”\n\nTopic 12. THE VIABILITY AND FUTURE OF “THE CHINESE MODEL”\nThere is an intimate connection between China's domestic economic and political achievements on the one hand, and its status and game plans in the global political economy on the other. How viable and sustainable is the \"China model\" -- here understood as not only the country's unique path to economic growth but also the convoluted trajectory of economic and political reforms? The lecture and discussion will focus on reforms introduced by the Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping administrations – and how they impact on China's ability to make a difference on the world stage.\n\nTopic 13. CHINA’S WORLD COMPETITIVENESS, THE “SILICON VALLEY” MODEL, AND “MADE IN CHINA 2025” INITIATIVE\nFollowing the discussion in the previous class on the \"China model,\" this lecture will discuss China's global competitiveness. Students are encouraged to assess the country's unique formula for promoting innovation in government institutions and businesses, including state-own-enterprise conglomerates as well as private firms. Can China nurture a \"Silicon Valley with Chinese characteristics\"? The successful globalization of a selective number of enterprises ranging from Huawei and Haier to Baidu and Alibaba will be analyzed. Premier Li Keqiang’s ambitious “Made in China 2025” program will be examined. Also analyzed will be the diplomatic functions of leading Chinese multinationals as well as their growing international responsibilities.\n\nTopic 14.

      "description": "Why do most societies around the world positively discriminate light-skinned, but negatively discriminate dark-skinned people? Why do social norms often restrict the freedoms of certain social identities, such as women? Why is the Global North rich but the Global South poor? This course tries to answer questions such as these by delving deeper into the roots of global inequality. In particular, it will focus on the interactive nature of the relationship between the individual (psychological level) and the social context that maintains social inequality. The course draws heavily from a multidisciplinary body of scholarship to shed light on the multilevel predictors of social inequality including, but not limited to, the global level (e.g., imperialism/(neo-)colonialism, globalization, the international media), the cultural level (e.g., neoliberalism, individualism/collectivism, racism/white supremacy), and the individual level (e.g., social dominance orientation, microaggressions, the self-concept), and how all levels mutually constitute each other. The course heavily emphasizes the Global North vs. South regional differences and attempts to highlight the subjective nature of unequal human relationships. As such, it adopts a critical approach that attempts to break with mainstream hegemonic conceptions of social inequality that often misrepresent it as natural, stable and fixed.",

      "description": "This course provides an opportunity for students to gain policy research experience working under a supervisor at a partnering organization in or beyond CUHK that is endorsed by the course coordinator. Over the course of the semester, students will contribute to an ongoing research project (topics vary annually), by performing policy-relevant research, surveying/canvassing, and/or data analysis. Each student is assigned a supervisor who will provide instruction, guidance, and assistance during the internship period. Students are required to submit a final report demonstrating the knowledge outcomes attained: for instance, background knowledge acquisition, experience in practical application of theory, data gathering, and data analysis. The student’s performance will be evaluated on the basis of his/ her final report and the supervisor’s assessment. This course is most similar to Independent Research (GPEC5850); the primary difference is that the focus of this course is on applied research, working with a team and supervised by a leading member of the partnering organizations concerned, while the focus of Independent Research can be more theoretical (e.g., literature review and analysis/interpretation) and is done independently under the supervision of a member of the MGPE teaching staff.",
