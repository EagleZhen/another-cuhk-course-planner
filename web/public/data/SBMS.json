Students will be given hands-on opportunities to repeatedly practice the skills being taught in specially arranged sessions to increase their confidence, and prepared to become a reasonable lab operator for laboratory sessions in other biomedical sciences courses, and before they join their first research attachment. Skill-specific assessment will be used to assess students’ holistic abilities including attitude, competency and accuracy in handling the various skills and techniques.",

Traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine use many crude herbs or extracts. Understanding the origin, identification, development, production, quality control and usage of traditional Chinese medicine and other natural products are important for drug development, phytotherapy, and nutraceuticals. This introductory course will first cover the fundamentals of modern pharmacy and medicine, and the basic concepts of traditional Chinese medicine. Next, the extraction of various chemical constituents, authentication analysis and quality control of plant derived extracts, and the regulatory measures of traditional Chinese medicine will be discussed. More advanced topics including application of pharmaceutically active compounds in common diseases; good agricultural, cultivation, manufacturing practices of traditional Chinese medicine; herbal-drug interactions, etc. will be introduced.",

The abnormal conditions of immune system result in many types of pathological conditions, such as chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, allergy and immunodeficiency. This course will introduce main concepts of immunology including cells and organs in the immune system, innate and adaptive immunity as well as some immunological techniques. Particular emphasis will be given to immune disorder related human diseases, including allergy, hypersensitivities, autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, and cancers. The understanding on current approaches of immunotherapy in infectious diseases and cancers will also be discussed.",

Understanding how the nervous system works is not only a major scientific quest of the 21st century, but also a prerequisite for designing novel, effective treatments for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. This introductory course will first cover some fundamentals in neuroscience such as action potential generation, synaptic plasticity, and basic neuroanatomy. The physiology, development and disorders of the different neural systems (including the visual, auditory, somatosensory, and motor systems) will then be explored. More advanced topics such as the neural basis of memory formation, computational neuroscience, evolutionary neuroscience, and emerging technologies for research and disease treatment will be introduced where appropriate.",

      "description": "Preventing and avoiding harm to patients is the most important concern when a candidate drug is able to translate from bench to bedside. Biological products include a wide range of biopharmaceuticals and biosimilars which involve living cells of human and non-human origins, therefore the handling and production of biologics involves prudent measures for ensuring product safety while maintaining efficacy. Testing of drugs, medicine, starting materials and adjuvants, or validation of tests and equipment must be carried out in accordance with the regulation of the country of origin or which the product will be marketed, and meeting the quality as stipulated in the pharmacopoeias. By studying this course, students will have an understanding of the overall concepts of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and how it is applied in controlled facilities for biologics or Advanced Therapy Products (ATPs). Students will learn to solve problems by participating in discussions, case studies, and using innovative teaching tools.",

The use of genetic information for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases has become an important tool in clinical medicine.

By studying the impact of congenital defects or chronic diseases on individuals and families, cross-cultural issues, and risk perception, students will also be exposed to bioethics topics related to prenatal diagnosis, genetic counselling and decision-making.",
