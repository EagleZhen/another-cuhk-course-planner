The course consists of the following key components: foundation of public policymaking process and policy environment, competing models of policy-making, major policymaking actors and institutions, critical factors and stakeholders in major stages of policymaking. Case studies and real-world examples are used to illustrate how the theories are put into practice.",

Each of these contextual factors is dealt with theoretically, using internationally recognized public policy texts and, practically, through climate change-related case studies as follows:\n1) Economic factors and the deployment of the Green Climate Fund (GCF);\n2) Social factors and climate justice;\n3) Environmental factors and climate resilience to flooding in coastal cities;\n4) Technological factors and the uptake of renewable energy;\n5) Legal factors and the implementation of the Paris Agreement & its Rulebook.",

It gives a general picture of contextual challenges confronting contemporary governments in forming and implementing public policies and discusses the ways in which governments have attempted to cope with these contextual changes and challenges, and how governance theories in public administration and more broadly political science have been developed to study the evolving modes of policy-making since the early 1990s.",

The course also discusses some fundamental issues concerning the approach, scope and methods of doing comparative public policy. The course is divided into two parts. First, some foundational concepts, conceptual definitions and the underpinnings of doing comparative public policy will be given. Second, cases in major policy areas including Hong Kong, China and major countries in regions around the world will be examined by applying the concepts and theoretical frameworks introduced.",

      "course_syllabus": "This course examines the comparative study of the essence, characteristics, structure and process of public policies. The assumption is that through comparative study on countries (regions) based on substantive differences in institutions, different governance styles, developmental stages, and varied political processes that will entail differences for us to learn from each other. Put it simply, comparative public policy is to explain policy outcomes by comparing different political units, whether they are national or sub-national governments. The course offers foundational concepts and approaches in the field of comparative public policy, and begins with an introduction to the concepts of understanding comparative public policy. Questions and issues such as why comparative approach is needed to the study of public policy; What the significances and benefits of doing this are; And how it is conducted comparatively will be tackled, among many others. Then we will focus on a few substantive policies subsequently such as anti-corruption policy, higher educational policy, housing policy, poverty issue and aging policy. All these illustrate and demonstrate the importance, significance and insight drawn from the comparative study of public policy. In short, both conceptual ideas and empirical policies will be studied to enhance our understanding of public policies in a comparative manner. Moreover, p\nractical implications and lessons will be drawn and learned. Last, but not the least, group presentations will be encouraged in the final weeks of the class.\nThe number of groups will depend on the size of the class and the presentations should provide an excellent forum for us to engage in an active mode of discussion. Ideas can be tested; points will be made, and, above all, judgements shall be formed. This will further cultivate a sense of group learning within a productive and an encouraging academic environment.",

      "description": "The course covers a wide range of topics to systematically train students on climate and, more broadly, environmental policy analysis. It starts with an introduction to environmental externalities and the Environmental Kuznets Curve. It then focuses on analytical tools, including environmental valuation, carbon accounting, decomposition analysis, and cost-benefit analysis. The course also explores environmental justice and politics. Various climate/environmental policy instruments will be examined, including environmental impact assessments, voluntary agreements, emission taxes/fees, emission trading, and command and control regulations. The final module focuses on environmental governance, addressing climate change control, and culminates in a mock climate conference. Throughout, the course balances theoretical concepts with practical applications, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of climate policy analysis and environmental governance.",
