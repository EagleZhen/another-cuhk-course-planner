It is the basic contention of this course that the making of public policies cannot be made divorced from moral and political values. These values provide justification for the legitimacy of policies. The course is divided into two parts. The first part introduces some major political theories and theoretical frameworks for students to understand the meaning and importance of values in different moral outlook. Values discussed cover rights and obligation, justice and fair procedure, freedom and democracy, community and citizenship, and the proper relation between personal and social responsibility. The second part focuses on case studies.",

The course also explores environmental justice and politics. Various climate/environmental policy instruments will be examined, including environmental impact assessments, voluntary agreements, emission taxes/fees, emission trading, and command and control regulations. The final module focuses on environmental governance, addressing climate change control, and culminates in a mock climate conference. Throughout, the course balances theoretical concepts with practical applications, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of climate policy analysis and environmental governance.",
