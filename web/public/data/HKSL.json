Students should register the course via KEEP, a CUHK eLearning platform where the course materials are uploaded.]This online course enables students to acquire some basics of Hong Kong Sign Language and the general principles for communicating with deaf people in a visual-gestural modality. With different videoed scenarios, students are systematically guided to acquire elementary signing skills for fulfilling basic communication needs in everyday situations. Emphasis will be placed on a range of simple, general-purpose expressions, which allow students to converse with local deaf people, as well as prepare themselves for learning the language further.",

The descriptors covers signing competences of sign language repertoire, diagrammatical accuracy, sociolinguistic appropriateness and cultural repertoire, sign text structure, setting and perspectives, language awareness and interpretation, presence and effect, processing speed, and signing fluency. Developing the competences at Level Pre-A1, students are treated as novice to Hong Kong Sign Language who are yet to acquire a generative capacity and will rely upon a repertoire of signs and formulaic expressions to\n● introduce themselves by fingerspelling their name and stating their hearing status;\n● use some basic greetings;\n● sign yes, no, thank you, sorry;\n● ask and tell time, day of the week, and month; and\n● make simple requests where pointing or other gesture serves to make reference to objects and events.",

This course adopts a communicative approach to teaching communication in Hong Kong Sign Language. Students will strengthen their comprehension and expression skills in a variety of communicative tasks and situations. Students will continue to acquire vocabulary and grammatical constructions through exposure to situational dialogues and interactive activities. Students will learn to express simple descriptions or comments on selected topics like personal experiences or plans. They will also learn to comprehend complex sign language texts on both concrete and abstract topics. Selected topics on Deaf culture and customs will be introduced in class or out-of-class activities to enhance students’ understanding of the local Deaf community.",
