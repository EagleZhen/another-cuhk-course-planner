      "description": "In this digital age, philosophical inquiries can benefit from embracing powerful computational tools in their methodology. This course is an introduction to the use of computational tools in the investigation of philosophical problems and will focus on some prominent examples of leveraging computation tools in addressing philosophically significant issues. These examples may include (but are not limited to)• tools for data analysis in general (such as JASP) and corpus analysis in particular (such as Voyant), in connection with inquiries in the history of philosophy and in experimental philosophy • tools for agent-based modelling (such as NetLogo), in connection with inquiries in social epistemology and in moral and political philosophy• tools for probabilistic and causal modelling (such as Tetrad), in connection with inquiries in Bayesian epistemology and in general philosophy of science • tools for virtual reality (such as A-Frame), in connection with inquiries in traditional metaphysics and epistemology. Specific tools to be introduced in this course and related philosophical topics to be discussed are likely to vary from semester to semester, but the core purpose of the course remains the same: to expose students to various ways computational tools can help with philosophical investigations and to give them hands-on experience in using the tools to address philosophically motivated problems. In addition to exploring the power of computational methods, this course will also help students understand their limitations.Advisory to Majors: to be taken in year 2 or above.",
