It provides the students extensive hands-on training on robot prototype development and experimental evaluation. It adopts a project-based learning approach: the students are required to design and build a fully functional robotic system that must be able to perform a specific task. Both mechanical and electronic hardware will be designed and developed by the students. The lectures and laboratory sessions are designed so as to equip them with the essential knowledge to successfully complete their project.",

This requires the students to design a new application for robot manipulators that would be useful to the community and globally. By using the introduction to the state-of-the-art in robotics around the world, and fundamentals learnt in the course, the students have to innovatively design and present the idea as a mock start-up company project.",

      "description": "Combustion and its control are essential to our daily life and more than 80% of the energy used nowadays is from combustion sources. This course starts with the basic principles that govern combustion phenomena such as conservation of mass, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and the momentum principle. Then students will learn the new applications of these basic principles to account for the chemical transformations. We will discuss the basic concepts of chemical kinetics and the forms of reaction rate laws that apply in combustion processes, as well as mass transport phenomena. These laws will be applied to a variety of combustion phenomena, including spontaneous ignition of combustible mixtures, pollutant formation, internal combustion engine and fire safety.",

It begins by describing the main AM technologies and their respective advantages and disadvantages. It then examines strategic considerations in the context of designing for additive manufacturing (DfAM), such as designing to avoid anisotropy, designing to minimize print time, and post-processing, before discussing the economics of AM. The course then focuses on computational tools for design analysis and the optimization of AM parts, part consolidation, and tooling applications. Both designing for polymer AM and metal AM and its corresponding design guidelines will be provided. The main benefit of the course is its combined theoretical and practical approach, which provides directly applicable, “hands-on” information and insights to help students adopt AM in their daily practice.",

      "description": "This course is designed to allow students to acquire a basic understanding and the skills of the practical aspects of the Mechanical and Automation Engineering profession. During the internship, the student must attach to a company in a study-related position for no less than 12 weeks. The student will have an academic supervisor (as primary supervisor) and an industry co-supervisor from the company, both have the expertise to provide advice to the student. To be qualified for award of the subject credit, the student must submit a report summarizing the internship experience at the end of the internship. Additional presentation may be required by the hosting company.\n\nThe internship should normally take place in the summer term after a student has finished the first two semesters of studies. Part-time students can decide to undertake the internship in the summer term of either the first or second year of studies.\n\nStudents are recommended to seek the Professor-in-Charge's comment on potential internship opportunities before enrolling in the course.",
