Using an issue-inquiry approach, course participants will be led to critically reflect on the issues from various perspectives: philosophical, scientific, social and educational.

It also sensitizes learners to various aspects of school life at a micro level, in order to see how these are constrained by macro economic, political and social forces on the one hand, and how these forces go into the making of students’ identities and relationships on the other. This course attempts to portray all these macro and micro dynamics in the local context, and at the same time, depicts how these are played out in selected education policies and the process of policy-making itself.",

      "description": "Teachers are expected to play multiple roles in the education reform process. Shifting expectations require teachers to have a firm understanding of how schools operate and how reforms affect their roles both in and outside of the classroom. To effectively reshape their work in line with growing expectations, teachers must understand the current reality of school administration, their own personal weaknesses, commit to career-long professional development and consider strategies for maximizing their effectiveness. This course is designed to help teachers understand and shape their roles in a reform environment. In others words it aims to help teachers become leaders of their own professionalism. It does this in two ways. First, its aims to nurture teachers’ awareness of their own professional growth and how they can maximize the latest opportunities available in this area. Second, it helps teachers understand life in schools undergoing reform and the effect this can have on their professional life. Topics covered in the course are: understanding teachers’ role and the complexity of the school organization, developing personal mastery and personal vision in education, systems thinking and problem solving in the organization and in the classroom, learning shared vision and team learning skills, leading and managing change in school, etc.",

      "description": "Drawing on sociological and socio-psychological perspectives, this course tries to sensitize students to the gender implications underlying educational structures and processes. This course examines how various aspects of education, including its hierarchical structure, the curriculum and school processes, are shaped by the changing needs of capitalism and patriarchy. At the same time, this course will attempt to identify the various contradictions, paradoxes and space for resistance embedded in education. This course sees education as the site for the construction of and contests involving gender and sexualities. It also deconstructs dominant epistemologies, and introduces students to research concerning gender-differentiated modes of learning. The ultimate goal is to enable students to question existing power relationships in patriarchy, as well as concepts and views that are deeply embedded in such relationships, so as to be able to build up a broader intellectual space for themselves.",

Philosophical, historical, social, psychological and pedagogical foundations on moral education and citizenship education will be explored. Among other important considerations, students are asked whether teachers should or can teach their own values in the classroom, and whether this is indeed inevitable. Taking education as a means aiming at nurturing human qualities for the sake of personal and social well-being, the course examines a range of values such as truth, beauty, goodness and justice as embodied in ‘whole-person education’. Key concepts like human rights, rule of law, democracy, nation-state, and globalization will be compared. How these concepts can be taught and learnt in daily classroom will be discussed. During the course students will discuss the nature of morality and explore various perspectives of moral education, values education and citizenship education. Students will also be asked to reflect upon how they understand their own personal and professional development in relation to values, moral and civic education and how to enact their various roles in the school.",

It will draw on philosophical, historical, cultural, psychological, pedagogical and religious sources when relevant.　Among other important deliberations, students are helped to reflect on their quest of meaning of life, in which kinds of deaths and their causes (e.g. mental health problems) are explored. Students learn how to cope with suicidal tendency of oneself and others, or sudden deaths of family members or friends. They will also learn how to prepare themselves as teachers in helping their future school pupils to cope with related issues on meaning concerns in death and life education.",

An integrated approach of theory, research and practice will be adopted in this course. It begins with inviting course participants to explore major theories of motivation for deeper insights into the learning process. Current research findings on psychological constructs related to motivation and de-motivation in school learning will then be discussed. Examples of these constructs are self-concept, self-efficacy, goal orientation, self-regulation, curiosity, interest, flow, learned helplessness, teachers’ expectations and teachers' feedbacks. Individual differences in such aspects as cognitive style, memory, intelligence, creativity, problem solving, prior knowledge and personal epistemology will also be examined. To discuss teaching strategies that would optimize students’ motivational level and to accommodate for their individual differences, we will deliberate on various instructional designs, ranging from classroom strategies to a school-wide approach.",

Students will be able to integrate theory and practice in the classroom setting when they are attached to schools to have teaching practice. Students will compile a Teaching Practice Portfolio which promotes reflection and a critical awareness of their teaching. Completion of ‘School Experience’, during which students observe classroom teaching and school life in general, is a prerequisite for this course.",

It then evaluates the utilities and the limitations of various assessment formats for assessing student attainments including knowledge, skills and behaviors. The assessment formats include the traditional ones (e.g., multiple-choice questions, short answers, essays), the alternative ones (e.g., portfolios, performance assessments; self and peer assessment, group assessment), and the types of assessment rubrics (holistic or analytic; generalized or task specific) used for evaluating student performance on the alternative assessments.",
