The course is aimed at preparing students as global and future citizens who not only have critical understandings of the environmental issues, but also the capabilities and attitudes to take an active role in tackling the issues and educating for the environment. This course is structured around key issues pertaining to environmentalism and environmental education, including climate changes, sustainability, green groups and environmental curriculum and teaching at schools. Using an issue-inquiry approach, course participants will be led to critically reflect on the issues from various perspectives: philosophical, scientific, social and educational. The different approaches to environmental education in the Western and Chinese communities will be explored in the contexts of eastern and western cultures.

      "description": "This course introduces learners to a structural analysis of schooling: its nature and how it has been shaped and, at the same time, how it contributes to macro social divisions and contradictions along class, gender and racial/ethnic lines. It also sensitizes learners to various aspects of school life at a micro level, in order to see how these are constrained by macro economic, political and social forces on the one hand, and how these forces go into the making of students’ identities and relationships on the other. This course attempts to portray all these macro and micro dynamics in the local context, and at the same time, depicts how these are played out in selected education policies and the process of policy-making itself.",

      "description": "Teachers are expected to play multiple roles in the education reform process. Shifting expectations require teachers to have a firm understanding of how schools operate and how reforms affect their roles both in and outside of the classroom. To effectively reshape their work in line with growing expectations, teachers must understand the current reality of school administration, their own personal weaknesses, commit to career-long professional development and consider strategies for maximizing their effectiveness. This course is designed to help teachers understand and shape their roles in a reform environment. In others words it aims to help teachers become leaders of their own professionalism. It does this in two ways. First, its aims to nurture teachers’ awareness of their own professional growth and how they can maximize the latest opportunities available in this area. Second, it helps teachers understand life in schools undergoing reform and the effect this can have on their professional life. Topics covered in the course are: understanding teachers’ role and the complexity of the school organization, developing personal mastery and personal vision in education, systems thinking and problem solving in the organization and in the classroom, learning shared vision and team learning skills, leading and managing change in school, etc.",

      "description": "Drawing on sociological and socio-psychological perspectives, this course tries to sensitize students to the gender implications underlying educational structures and processes. This course examines how various aspects of education, including its hierarchical structure, the curriculum and school processes, are shaped by the changing needs of capitalism and patriarchy. At the same time, this course will attempt to identify the various contradictions, paradoxes and space for resistance embedded in education. This course sees education as the site for the construction of and contests involving gender and sexualities. It also deconstructs dominant epistemologies, and introduces students to research concerning gender-differentiated modes of learning. The ultimate goal is to enable students to question existing power relationships in patriarchy, as well as concepts and views that are deeply embedded in such relationships, so as to be able to build up a broader intellectual space for themselves.",

      "description": "This course aims to help student-teachers to reflect on their own values and on the ways they teach values, especially those values related to moral education and citizenship education in school. Philosophical, historical, social, psychological and pedagogical foundations on moral education and citizenship education will be explored. Among other important considerations, students are asked whether teachers should or can teach their own values in the classroom, and whether this is indeed inevitable. Taking education as a means aiming at nurturing human qualities for the sake of personal and social well-being, the course examines a range of values such as truth, beauty, goodness and justice as embodied in ‘whole-person education’. Key concepts like human rights, rule of law, democracy, nation-state, and globalization will be compared. How these concepts can be taught and learnt in daily classroom will be discussed. During the course students will discuss the nature of morality and explore various perspectives of moral education, values education and citizenship education. Students will also be asked to reflect upon how they understand their own personal and professional development in relation to values, moral and civic education and how to enact their various roles in the school.",

      "description": "Understanding the motivation of and individual differences among students is essential for effective teaching and learning. An integrated approach of theory, research and practice will be adopted in this course. It begins with inviting course participants to explore major theories of motivation for deeper insights into the learning process. Current research findings on psychological constructs related to motivation and de-motivation in school learning will then be discussed. Examples of these constructs are self-concept, self-efficacy, goal orientation, self-regulation, curiosity, interest, flow, learned helplessness, teachers’ expectations and teachers' feedbacks. Individual differences in such aspects as cognitive style, memory, intelligence, creativity, problem solving, prior knowledge and personal epistemology will also be examined. To discuss teaching strategies that would optimize students’ motivational level and to accommodate for their individual differences, we will deliberate on various instructional designs, ranging from classroom strategies to a school-wide approach.",

      "description": "The course “Dynamic Curriculum Development for Innovative Learning Experiences” immerses students in the realm of curriculum design, emphasizing the creation of dynamic and innovative learning opportunities. Through this course, students will have the opportunity to explore the foundational principles and models that guide curriculum development. They will delve into a wide array of innovative approaches, such as curriculum integration, cooperative learning, experiential learning, project-based learning, and inquiry-based learning. The course will also cover essential aspects of implementing and evaluating dynamic curricula, such as assessing student outcomes and gathering valuable feedback from stakeholders. Students will gain insights into administration and risk management considerations crucial to effectively implementing innovative curriculum designs. By showcasing both local and global best practices, the course offers a comprehensive perspective that equips students with the ability to drive positive change, lead initiatives, employ diversified pedagogical approaches, and evaluate curriculum innovations to optimize student learning outcomes.There are five big questions guiding the course:1. How can we adopt a dynamic approach to curriculum development that fosters innovative learning experiences, captivating, and motivating students?2. How can change agents drive curriculum development and cultivate a culture of innovation in schools to create dynamic and meaningful learning experiences?3. What are the key principles, models, and strategies that drive the development of dynamic curricula?4. What innovative approaches and methodologies, such as integrated curriculum, collaborative learning, project-based, and inquiry-based learning, can be used to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes?5. How can we effectively implement and evaluate dynamic curricula to ensure successful implementation and continuous improvement?",
