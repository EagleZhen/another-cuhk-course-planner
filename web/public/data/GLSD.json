More specifically, this course offers an overview of the changing paradigm of global communication by studying the interrelation between cultural, economic, political, social, and technical dimensions of media and communication in the contemporary world, as well as examining the changing nature of power and the process of power diffusion in an information age. In doing so, this course will discuss the evolution of the transnational communication, the phenomenon of “electronic colonialism”, and the debate of New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) etc. This is an interdisciplinary course, which covers the essential theories and concepts ranging from political science, international relations, media studies and communication. The first session of this course will first introduce the new trend of globalization, in particular, the emergence of broadcasting news agency and social media. The second part of this course will then critically assess the impact of the new way of world communication on international affairs and domestic events.",

However, in this globalization era, people often have many cultural lenses. Through understanding the impact of globalization on cultures and societies, we will have nuanced understanding of how people from different cultures construct reality. Many scholars and activists argue that globalization will lead to a worldwide homogenized consumer culture dominated by Western values. Others believe that globalization can lead to the clashes of incorrigible cultures. Meanwhile, globalization has catalyzed formation of new hybrid cultures and fostered the blooming of creative cultural industries. In this course, we will explore the above topics through understanding the effects of globalization on personal identities, the economy, consumerism, and communication, etc. in the immediate and distal environment.",

This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to global politics, focusing in particular on its origins and historical evolution, its key concepts, major theoretical frameworks, main actors and institutions, the global architecture of power, and its dynamic nature in the process of globalization. It aims to offer students with the basic knowledge and analytical tools for making sense of current issues in global politics. It adopts a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates theoretical issues with regional case studies. The course will first offer a general survey of the key concepts and major theoretical perspectives in the study of Global Politics (Liberalism, Realism, Social Constructivism and Marxist theory, etc.). It then proceeds to cover selected topics of global politics in the areas of War and Peace and the Clash of Civilization. It focuses on how world politics is transformed by globalization, with a particular focus on its impacts on issues concerning the identity and national pride, balance of power, peace and conflicts, borders and security, etc. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of latest trends of global governance, with a particular focus on the emergency of international and regional organizations. Relevant real world examples and case studies will be adopted to illustrate the big ideas and key concepts of global politics.This course intends to promote students’ appreciation of the role of ‘power’, ‘security’ and ‘justice’ in shaping the global political order nowadays. Students will gain deeper insights into not only latest developments in global political affairs, but also concepts and theories useful for further studies in politics, international relations, and global political economy. The course is designed to introduce essential concepts, major theoretical perspectives and basic mechanisms of global political order, allowing students to communicate issues in world politics effectively in group work and individually, in oral as well as written forms.",

The capacity symbolizes the balance between population size and environmental resources ––the underlying foundation for sustainable development. In history, it is shown that the human carrying capacity was periodically shrunk by climate deterioration and human-induced environmental degradation, resulting in catastrophic social consequences such as mass migrations, wars, or even population collapses. In this course, the background knowledge of climate-induced and human-induced environmental change will be introduced. The associated physical and social dimensions of environmental change will also be covered. Based on the lessons of the past, together with recent trends in global climate change and social development, the human carrying capacity in contemporary societies will be systematically examined. Some controversial issues related to human-environment nexus will also be discussed. This is a course of general appeal to students with different backgrounds.",

      "description": "People from all over the world are similar to and different from one another. Besides being individuals, they are also products of their culture—their psychological processes (i.e., thoughts, feelings, behavior, identities, beliefs, and assumptions) are shaped by their cultural backgrounds and experiences. In this course, we learn about how cultures influence and shape individuals’ psychological processes, what happens when individuals from different cultures meet one another (resulting from globalization), and when cultures meet one another within individuals (resulting in multiculturalism).The course will focus on timely, essential and at times sensitive and controversial topics central to the psychology of globalization, such as colonialism and how it shaped our psychological understanding of ourselves and others; how racism and stereotyping are psychological phenomena that interfere with successful globalization today; or how different moral cultures understand and often conflict with each other.This course adopts an introductory approach to cultural psychology and focuses on how our individual psychology interacts with an increasingly globalized world. The first part of the course will introduce students to fundamental concepts and findings in the field of cultural psychology. The second part of this course will explore the relevance of this body of knowledge in a time of rapid globalization, one of the most important developments in the twenty-first century.",

After providing a brief historical advancement of addressing trans-boundary environmental problems, it proceeds to examine how different actors respond to the problems. Also, the roles played by different actors in global environment governance on selected topics are discussed. It focuses not only on how the responses of different actors towards global environmental crisis are driven by world politics, but also the tight connection between global political-economy and physical environment, including how socio-economic factors contribute to, and also being affected by, global environmental problems. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of the latest trends and future of global environmental governance, particularly the recent dynamics of international and regional organizations.
