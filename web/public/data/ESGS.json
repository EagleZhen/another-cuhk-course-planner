While the topic of earth environmental modelling is broad, this course will focus on the fundamental concepts of numerical modelling, such as temporal and spatial discretizations, parameterizations, model uncertainty and evaluation. Various components of earth system model will be introduced, including atmospheric general circulation model, regional climate model, weather prediction and land surface model, oceanic general circulation model, air quality model, health assessment model and integrated assessment model. In addition, this course will discuss numerical model design, application and testing. Practical exercises such as weather forecast and air quality prediction are also provided for students to gain technical skills and hands-on experience in modelling.",

The integration of SN and positioning technologies offers a powerful combination of distributed sensing capacity, real time data visualization and spatial analysis and integration with remote sensing data sources. The combined technologies are greatly needed in large-scale environmental monitoring and Smart Cities developments. Another half of the course introduces the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and other indoor positioning technologies. It covers the basic principles, advanced techniques as well as their applications in Earth System Sciences and urban management. With the background knowledge and the practical skills, students shall be able to integrate GNSS and SN in their future research and studies.",
