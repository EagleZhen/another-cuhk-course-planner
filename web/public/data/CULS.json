      "description": "This course is interested in how modernity is defined by contradiction and plurality not simply within the same city but across disparate geographic locations and historical periods. Looking at the variances of urban modernity, we will examine how blueprints for modernist, global, creative, and smart cities are articulated within the greater Asia region. Such templates are often standardized, top-down visions for urban renewal, economic growth, and technological progress with contrasting degrees of triumphalism and failure. The focus on metropolitan areas and city clusters offers a way of thinking beyond (or beneath) the nation. Uncovering characteristic tropes in film and visual cultures of the city, we will explore how multiple modernities are produced, disseminated, consumed, and reproduced through different media ecologies such as cinema, photography, visual art, architecture, maps, comic books, video games, and social media. Embracing a more expansive definition, we will regard Asia as sprawling, archipelagic, and diverse, inclusive of the marginalized, diasporic populations of Southeast Asia.We will ask: How can the complex flows, processes, and rhythms of a modern metropolis be visualized? What social and economic changes prevail in the shift to modes of governmentality characteristic of the conditions of neoliberal capitalism, media convergence, and immaterial production? How do urban infrastructure and architecture manage the dynamisms and tensions of modern flows and rhythms to reshape work productivity, public order, and collective memory? How are the voices and rights of the burgeoning class of cosmopolitan consumers and transnational migrants delimited and excluded from the configuration and operation of the modern Asian city?",

How is the understanding of the body informed and transformed by scientific development? Throughout this course we will seek answers to these questions by focusing on the Western and the Chinese traditions from the cultural and the scientific perspectives. We will analyse some important themes of the subject by integrating a theoretical approach with art, photography, films, novels and short stories.",

      "description": "Cinema is one of the most important forms of representations in contemporary culture, and in this course we study film and video from the perspective of cultural studies. The course is not aimed at teaching students basic skills of textual and image analysis, but we read cinema culturally and politically. We want to examine how the cultural forms of moving images carry meanings, and how it can and cannot be used as ideological apparatus. Through the studies of film and video we also trace the development of contemporary visual culture and examine how it defines (post)modern lives and experience. Studying through the history of moving images, this course provides students a general theoretical landscape to understand and criticize our contemporary mass representations. Our ultimate aim is to interrogate the boundaries and to locate new terrains between cinema studies and cultural studies.",

This course will trace the development of the concept across different disciplines and theoretical paradigms, review socio-economic and cultural accounts of globalization, study artistic production, and examine counter-discourses and social movements against globalization. Throughout the course, we will interrogate the politics of representation around globalization, questioning specifi cally the grounds on which global claims are made; the categories, processes, and practices foregrounded and occluded; the voices privileged, heard and silenced; and the kinds of subjectivities and collective identities enabled and produced in globalization discourses.",

      "description": "The last two decades witness the rise of vibrant new social movements in the field of sexuality, which, together with many other intersecting social forces, has tremendously reshaped the socio-political landscapes, here and abroad. This course aims to examine the historical trajectory of queer movements as well as the issues and debates pertinent to them so as to make sense of the complexity of sexual politics in the late modern society. It also poses challenges to the commonly held division between academy and social activism by examining their intertwined but not very smooth relationship. To that end, the course will draw on the works of lesbian and gay historians such as Lillian Faderman, Jeffrey Weeks, John D’Emilio and Michel Foucault to lay a social constructionist framework through which the emergence of polymorphous sexual subjects is understood. The social construction of homosexuality in Hong Kong since the 1980s will be discussed as a case in point. The works of Diana Fuss, Judith Butler and Eve Segewick will guide us to explore the internal dilemma of identity politics and the queer turn in the study of sexuality.",

      "description": "AI have radically changed our idea of who we are, how we behave, and our notion of identity, agency, and society. This course explores the fascinating intersection of computation, digital technologies, and ethical concerns, exploring pivotal questions regarding the relationship between AI functionality (and dysfunctionality), human labor, and humanities. What is the labor, environmental, and social issues behind the use of AI? Where does human agency lie in the world undergirded by various systems of machines, networks of computers, and the cloud? This course introduces key intellectual commitments of digital studies and its recent engagement with AI ethics, including untangling the stories we tell ourselves about human uniqueness in face of machine intelligence, the material infrastructure of information, and the ethics issues that arise in the evolving landscape of AI infusion. In this class, we will use various media, including movies, anime, and documentaries as illustrations to facilitate the critical assessment of conceptual frameworks.",

      "course_syllabus": "This course introduces the following 11 fundamental aspect of AI as it is embedded in our cultural history and contemporary society.\nDigital: \"Digital\" refers to the broad transformation of information and processes into digital form. The course may explore how AI relies on digital data and processes, as well as the implications of the digital transformation on society.\nCybernetics: Cybernetics is the study of systems, control, and communication in animals, machines, and organizations. This course examines the history of cybernetic and how the military roots have morphed into both popular culture (cyberpunk) and everyday life.\nAlgorithm: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing tasks. The course would likely delve into the significance of algorithms in AI, the mythical association of algorithms, and the fetishization of this term in various commercial practices.\nGhost Work: Ghost work refers to the often invisible and under-appreciated human labor that supports AI systems, such as data labeling and content moderation. The course may investigate the ethical and labor-related aspects of ghost work.\nInfrastructural Turn: This concept focuses on the environmental implications of AI infrastructure, including data centers and energy consumption. Students might explore the environmental concerns associated with the growth of AI technologies.\nGeopolitics of AI: The course would likely examine the global political and economic dimensions of AI, including questions of power, influence, and competition among nations and corporations in the AI domain.\nArtificial Communication: AI's capacity to communicate is a central theme. The course may emphasize that AI is not about intelligence but also about the ways in which AI systems communicate with humans and other systems.\nConsent and Surveillance: Consent relates to the ethical and legal aspects of data collection and use in AI systems. Surveillance explores how AI technologies can be used for monitoring and its implications for privacy and civil liberties.\nChatbots Disciplines: This concept may involve an examination of how chatbots and conversational AI shape human cognition, social interaction, and information consumption, and how they are integrated into various disciplines.\nAI Auditing: Students might explore the need for auditing AI systems to ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in their decision-making processes. This relates to addressing biases and ethical concerns.\nAI Fairness: AI fairness deals with ensuring that AI systems do not discriminate or reinforce societal biases. The course may delve into methods and principles for achieving fairness in AI algorithms and applications.\nOverall, this course would provide a comprehensive understanding of AI's multifaceted impact on society, covering technological, ethical, labour-related, environmental, and geopolitical dimensions, among others.",

      "description": "The idea of the Anthropocene – the geological Age of Man – has become widely adopted as a way of describing the entanglement of human activities and the natural world after its popularization by Paul Crutzen in 2000. In the age of the Anthropocene, challenges arising from global environmental change are numerous: extreme weather, land and water pollution, species extinction, toxic contamination, just to name a few. These challenges are now raising concerns both from scholars in the natural science and from the humanities and the social sciences. This course works on a rapidly growing field of Enviornmental Humanities constituted by the work of scholars from a wide variety of disciplines including history, literature, philosophy, cultural studies, religion studies, arts.It aims to provide students with some recent methodological and theoretical approaches of understanding the anthropocene, including cultural ecology, environmental history, science studies, poststructuralist cultural studies, and eco-feminism. Envisioning the field as a trandisciplinary arena, the course will foster students to think across disciplinary borders in order to tackle the environmental and social challenges of current times.",

Nevertheless, as the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, protection policy, law-making and media portrayals of animals are the hot topics in our (post)modern culture, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of an advanced human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals’ life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.",

Identify the key issues and critical assessment of human-animal relationship;\n3. Understand the approach in studying culture, animal and environment;\n4. Enrich the angle of analyzing human living and animal species.",
      "course_syllabus": "This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:\nA. Entering Jurassic World – Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)\nB. Attacking Godzilla – Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)\nC. Leaving Zootopia – Revitalizing Animals in the City (Lecture C1-C4)\nEach area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life.\nArea B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in animation, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making.\nArea C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.",

      "description": "This course is designed to study Hong Kong from the perspectives of HK discourses formed in the past decades, with emphasis on the post-1997 context, where we witness the proliferation of HK discourses consolidating, contesting or displacing each other incessantly. In this course we will examine them in both breadth and depth; topics discussed include (post)coloniality, transborder, city and space awareness, variegated localism, China factor, cosmopolitanism, mega-region, generation, social movement, etc. While the topics are not in strict chronological order and each has a narrative of its own, they are unfolded in a sequence that overall form a historical picture of Hong Kong and its discourse formation. For each topic, students will be introduced with theoretical concepts, narrative and representations involved. Students will also get to know some key scholars involved in the discussion. Not shun from taking position, students are encouraged to keep open-minded and evaluate the issues critically, particularly to treat the discourses as ongoing process rather than static products. While we focus on one topic per week for explication purpose, students should note the intricate relationship among the related topics, and keep in mind to build the linkage and dialogue among them.",

      "description": "This course aims to trace affinities and linkages among cultural processes, geopolitical conditions, and media representations within the greater Asian region, broadly defined. Expanding its scope beyond a single nation, race, or language, the course builds on the comparativist work of Benedict Anderson, Chen Kuan-hsing, Aihwa Ong, and Anna Tsing in Asian Studies and Inter-Asia Cultural Studies to uncover the multiplicity of diverse Asias. Its focal points are keywords, objects, and images that would have social resonance in particular locations and societies. Examining their global interchange through an array of print, audiovisual, and digital media, it focuses on their variance in form, use, and meaning across distinct spatial environments and historical periods with a spotlight on vernacular perspectives and experiences.In each semester, the course will explore a combination of the following questions: How are different understandings of ‘neoliberalism,’ development,’ and ‘democracy’ exemplified by contrasting conditions of political, social, and historical transformation? How are the racial, ethnic, or religious identities of Chinese-ness or Muslim-ness shaped by diaspora, tourism, and media? How is the experience and consumption of nostalgia configured by particular conditions of intensifying economic and emotional instability? How is colonialism a system that exceeds the dichotomy between East and West to encompass intraregional hierarchies centered on the economic and cultural superiority of Japan or China? How have interactions and exchanges among intellectuals, revolutionaries, and migrants constituted imaginaries of ‘pan-Asianism’? With this transnational orientation, the course hopes to expand the locus of the discussion beyond Asia to encompass its trans-oceanic connections with Africa and Latin America.",

      "description": "Fandom, or fan culture, is a term that accompanies lots of stigma in the past and is now a fancy entry into cyberspace subculture in the web 2.0(or even web 3.0) era. It describes communities built by like-minded people in any aspect of popular culture, such as sports, movies, television dramas or music, who actively produce creative content for their uses. As Henry Jenkins once suggested, most fan cultures show elements of participatory culture, as fan communities enjoy their own readings of popular culture and encourage artistic creations and expression. While scholars of popular culture criticise consumers of popular content as \"disciplined readers\" who are being manipulated by the culture industry and follow suit the mass culture, scholars who underpinned the participation of fans consider popular culture consumers as poachers who appropriate ideas from the media text and reinterpret them in creative ways. Therefore, by focusing on fan activities, this field of study provides gateways for further investigation of both individual and collective human agency in media and popular culture through community building, mass consumption, subculture in mediascape and participatory culture. Through this course, students will learn the relationship between fan cultures concerning consumer culture, identity formation, gift economy, emotion economy etc., in contemporary mediascapes.",

      "description": "Cultural meanings of health and disease are shaped not only by scientific and medical discourses but also by media technologies, from film to smart phones to medical imaging technologies like X-rays. Through an interdisciplinary approach that combines cultural studies, media studies, science and technology studies, and cultural anthropology, this course examines how the media of medicine shapes well-being and vitality in a global context of profound inequality and geopolitical tension. Through topics like mental health, vaccine politics, surveillance, clinical research ethics, and refugee medicine, we will learn how media shapes ideas of normal vs. abnormal, public support for health interventions, and how individuals and collectives understand and contest biomedical knowledge. Our investigations will show us why some people's bodies and lives are made to suffer more in the name of public health and medical advancement—which often reflect race, class, gender, sexuality, and other categories of social difference— and why the legacies of colonialism in health and medicine persist in both local and global contexts.This course is open to all, and no background in medicine is necessary.",

      "description": "The cultural and creative industries have become the central to policies around the world as in the promotion of a Global Creative Economy. Art, culture and technological innovation are employed in the branding of cities in order to compete on the global stage, contributing to inequality and sky-rocketing property prices in urban centres like Hong Kong, Paris and Tokyo. Cultural policies are resulting in major cultural development projects in the accelerated modernisation of China. These projects, including the Greater Bay Area as part of the Belt and Road Initiative will transform the life, culture and economy in these regions and around the world. In consideration of these developments, how can artists and practitioners consider their own roles within this economy, without being complicit or left behind? In this class, students will gain a deeper understanding of the global cultural economy and how cultural policies impact the work of practitioners. Topics around cultural work and labour conditions, ideologies of technological innovation and entrepreneurship, soft power and cultural diplomacy and creative cities and the role of art and culture in urban regeneration will be discussed in the course. This course will aid students in developing tools for analysing and critiquing cultural development projects and policies through different theoretical and artistic perspectives to support their own research and practice in the field.",

      "description": "One of the most challenging aspects of visual arts management is the practice of curatorship. With the rapid global growth of museums and the popularity of the biennale culture, curatorial interpretation has become an influential force in shaping the definition of art and museum. Exhibition venues are the places where various artistic practices and concepts intermingle and drift. Act of curating is not only administrative and managerial activities but becomes part of the exhibition itself nowadays. Thus, this course provides the idea of the curatorial and its history, theory, and praxis. This course nurtures students’ creative and interpretive skills in conceiving and developing curatorial ideas, equips students with the technical, managerial, and communicative skills in planning, organizing, and interpreting exhibitions. It also introduces a critical study of practice of curatorship, reviewing its traditions, limitations and possibilities for abuses and development.Prerequisite course(s): CULS5307",

      "description": "In the last decade, there has been a significant growth in the number and types of arts and cultural venues in East and Southeast Asia. Increasingly, cultural managers are expected to contribute to the day-to-day operations of various types of cultural venues. At the same time, cultural managers are also taking on key roles in the venues’ programming decisions. Many of these new venues are developed as cultural landmarks of their respective cities (for instance, the rapid roll out of performing arts centres and museums in Mainland China) or revitalized from existing heritage sites. Apart from these mega cultural venues’ projects, there is also a growing number of non-conventional arts and cultural spaces initiated by business owners and cultural organizations. The pandemic has also triggered new thinking in the role of physical cultural venues as well as accelerated the shift towards digital venue and art tech. This course aims to address all the above issues.",

A single course on Special Topics in Cultural Management is no longer sufficient to cover new topics related to this time of massive transformation in the arts and cultural sectors. Special Topics in Cultural Management II focuses on a specific topic on cultural management that is not covered in the regular course offerings of the cultural management programme. It aims to enrich the programme with fully developed topics concerning cultural management. As the content of this course changes from year to year, students are allowed to take this course more than once (not within the same term) and gain the units each time they pass the course. However, students cannot take the same topic twice.",

      "description": "This course will study contemporary art systems and institutions as cultural forms within the broader ‘cultural ecology’ of modern cities such as Hong Kong. It will consider the development of post-formalist art forms and time-based media such as installation art, digital media art, video art and performance art and how these art forms are employed within traditional art spaces, public spaces, social media platforms and activist movements. The aim of the course is also to introduce students to a general historical framework of contemporary art with a focus on dialogic aesthetics and participatory art forms. The students will learn about movements and concepts and how to apply these discourses by researching Hong Kong artists as well as traditional and grassroots institution and cultural precincts. Finally, students will contribute to artistic discourses by curating an innovative work of contemporary art and artist residency. The course will outline institutional and promotional structures of art curating and the benefits of cultural interactivity and exchange.",

The course is concerned to chart the development of new technocultural forms of literacy and their conceptual frameworks in cognitive and affective thought processes, in ‘information aesthetics’ and in distributed network theory. The aim is to understand the cultural implications of these developments as well as considering cultural and economic dimensions of the transformation of the ‘public sphere’ in, for example, the use of tracking and surveillance technologies for both security and market research activities.",

The course will consider the histories of techniques embedded in new tools of impage production (the metaphoric containment, for example, of the histories of painting, photography and printing in programs like Photoshop). The course will also consider the impact of new photomedia technologies on public access to archive resources in digitization projects and new systems of database design and indexing which image resources require.

      "description": "This course examines the intersection of urban and cinematic experiences, it will investigate the images that define and brand cities, their implications to our future life, and it also encourages students to record and decipher their own experiences and imagine their living cities with self-produced short films essay that counteract emerging global cityscapes. Based on the theories of Gilles Deleuze, cinematic image as a thinking tool is used to see and reflect on the world and the experience of it. Certain poetic languages of cinema and urban theories are introduced as a plethora of expressive visual languages for students to examine their own thinking and experience in the city critically and reflectively.",

      "description": "The twentieth century is a period of rupture for Chinese arts, in which artists experimented ferociously to develop different forms of modern arts that could respond to drastic social change. A central concern is to transform Chinese visual arts into both modern and Chinese, representing an independent people and nation marching into modernity. Developed around the visual arts, the course would ultimately like to ask a political question: is there a national style? This course focuses primarily on the Chinese arts, but we will also pay attention to artistic movements outside China. We will explore different genres of visual arts as well as the overall social and political order of the time. In contrast to the traditional art history approach, this course is devoted to the investigation of how arts and politics became so mutually constitutive with each other in the Chinese context, and how the revolution discourse relied heavily on the arts to connect to the people. We will also explore how Maoist arts cannot be understood simply as political tool. In addition to providing a general overview of the development of arts, we will also investigate the meanings of artistic freedom in China, and explore the identity of artists and authors under an official ideology in which collectivity is deemed much more important than individuals. At a time when nationalism perpetuates Chinese society, a revisit of the “national style” of Chinese arts developed in the twentieth century invites students to reflect on the meanings of Chinese arts beyond narrow-minded Sino-centric frameworks. We could instead go back to some basic aesthetic values and concepts such as emancipation, democracy, and plurality. This course is as much one of art history as one of political and intellectual history.",

      "description": "An introductory seminar to all postgraduate research students beginning in the field of cultural studies, with the special focus on the understanding of contemporary culture. While no single course can aptly fulfill this enormous task, in this seminar we will tackle specifically the interactions of three major forces making up contemporary culture, namely, modernity, capitalism, and globalization. We will discuss their underlying ideologies and mechanism, and how they interact to form a larger network conditioning our everyday lives. We will investigate not only how they constitute contemporary culture discursively but also how their differences or sometimes contradictory agendas created rooms for interrogations and alternatives. This course is designed to provide a macro framework for students to understand certain major social mechanisms at work, but students are also expected to provide their own micro readings of contemporary culture to comprehend, supplement, and criticize these theoretical writings.

But the main purpose of the course is not to simply expand the possible meanings and manifestations of the notion of “text”. Through various examples, we want to theorize what representation is and can be. We will examine the complex relationships between form and content, production and reception, theories and the actual materiality and non-discursiveness of culture. The course materials include various perspectives to understand the nature and the politics of representation, and it also includes selected examples of scholarly interpretations of different representations that could benefi t students’ own research.",

      "description": "This course examines the slippery category of “things” that has emerged in the past decade as an interdisciplinary endeavor involving anthropologists, political scientists, philosophers, literary critics and natural scientists among others. The new field of studies considers ontological ideas about the relationship between humans and 'things'. In her book Vibrant Matter (2011), political theorist Jane Bennett argues that non-human forces actively participate in socio-economic and political process, and that matters or “things” possess power that is not reducible to human meanings. This course asks students to throw away old conceptualization that human makes things and history. It turns the question around to ask how “things” make people and how to have a new imagination of world politics and social justice based on new connection between human and non-human “things.” Can things, such as technology, corporeality and matters be understood as having a form of subjectivity, being, and agency of their own? Can we think of a new way of understanding the social with non-human “things?”",

      "description": "This course is interested in the interaction, passage, and convergence between different modalities of media production and representation. Exploring the theoretical, semantic, and historical relationships among cinema, photography, visual art, and social media, it will examine the complex, ambivalent intermedial space between image and text, print and audio, analog and digital, and platform and infrastructure.The term ‘inter-’ might suggest a smooth, uninterrupted state or process of synergy. This course will uncover how intermedial encounters or exchanges within disparate social, historical, and cultural milieus are messy, contingent, and pluralistic situations of juxtaposition, overlap, and negotiation. In such intermedial situations, the components, functions, and processes of different media modalities are often modulated, constricted, or subtracted to be made more workable and effective within larger ecologies of signification and usage.",
