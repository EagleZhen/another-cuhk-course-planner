Understanding how to create, manage and manipulate data is of paramount importance for young designers entering into a digital industry. The ability to manipulate formulae is a powerful tool for digital designers. It is an invaluable asset in architectural expression and lays the foundation for building a set of dynamic drawing tools.

It will reach this goal by identifying and investigating historic works of architecture from China and other Asian cultures that survive to the present. These investigations, which will employ the methods that historians currently use to analyse architecture, will provide students with the means to study other building types and architectural dynamics in further courses ARCH3322 and ARCH3323 of the architectural history and theory sequence.",

      "course_syllabus": "The course will deal primarily with the history of Chinese architecture. It will be centered on Beijing as the focus to explore the various cultural on the architectural forms. As the capital city of China for more than 600 years, Beijing is a rich deposit of various building types, from the grandest to the humblest. These are the examples for the study of Chinese architectural. By extension, examples from outside Beijing will also be drawn, including those from East Asia. It is structured into two main parts: Part I will deal with the architectural language of China and East Asia, and Part II will deal with specific examples of Chinese buildings within the historical development. It will be divided into three thematic sections relating to forms of human and social activities: dwelling, religious pursuits and political manifestations. These are the most essential activities of the human world, individually and collectively, in the traditional period of time. Here, the language of the architectural form will be overlaid with historical and cultural contexts so that the perception of these forms and meaning ascribed to them by their users will be explored.",

      "description": "Architectural Design Studio I to IV (ARCH3113, 3114, 4115, 4116) form a sequence of project-based professional courses in architecture. This course, through different projects, will allow students to learn the process of building design and hone their design skill by either focusing on specific aspects of architecture or addressing various factors that influence the architectural form. These factors include activities, environmental technology, sustainable design and urban setting. Students are also required to demonstrate an understanding of structure, construction system and materials through their design.",

      "course_syllabus": "Architectural design and natural forces.\nThe basic forces in nature; gravity, light, wind, air movement, and temperature, can serve as primary generators of form and architectural intention. Addressing both the functional and aesthetic criteria of design is seen as compatible and contributing to a legible, non-derivative expression of form.\n\nBuilding technologies: catalyst for inspiration and basis for architectural strategy.\nMaterials and methods of construction play a key role in defining both the logic and the visual character of a building. The interplay between computer-controlled fabrication (mass customization), collaborative digital modeling (BIM) and integrated component assembly is driving many of the most innovative architectural designs today. However, in a world that is refocusing on the benefits of sustainable design, old and proven materials and methods of construction, seen in a new light, may also provide new inspiration for achieving low energy/low carbon footprint building design.\n\nMaking: material, fabrication, connection and assembly.\nBuilding is an act of making. Making involves both an activity of the mind (thought) and the physical action (skill) of fabricating and constructing. This studio views craft in construction as a design activity in itself. Decisions about the choice of materials, the methods used for shaping/forming, and the techniques employed for connecting/joining are all considered part of the design process. To better understand the implications on built form, the studio engages students in the design and construction of functional objects at full scale.\n\nPerformance evaluation in the design process.\nAll building design is based to some degree on performance criteria. These criteria are either explicit or implicit in the building program. In order to predict and measure performance in a hypothetical or un-built design, some form of simulation is required. The studio employs several forms of simulation in design including physical modeling, full-scale prototype testing and various types of computer modeling to simulate the effects of structural loadings, airflow, lighting, and thermal conditions.",

      "description": "Computational design, as an approach to architecture, applies the science of design problem solving to space, analysis, representation, interactivity, and buildability in the real world. Understanding how to create, manage and manipulate data is of paramount importance for young designers entering into a digital industry. The ability to manipulate formulae is a powerful tool for digital designers. It is an invaluable asset in architectural expression and lays the foundation for building a set of dynamic drawing tools. This course guides students through the rudiments of computational design, and gradually builds up a vocabulary of operations necessary to control elements within a three-dimensional environment.",

As the culmination of three-course sequence in architectural history and theory, the course will reach this goal by identifying and investigating historic and modern works of architecture from cultures around the world (including Asian and Chinese). These investigations will employ the methods that historians currently use to analyse architecture. It will provide students with the means to study building types and architectural dynamics of different places while drawing out relationships between past and present.",

It will be centered on Beijing as the focus to explore the various cultural on the architectural forms. As the capital city of China for more than 600 years, Beijing is a rich deposit of various building types, from the grandest to the humblest. These are the examples for the study of Chinese architectural. By extension, examples from outside Beijing will also be drawn, including those from East Asia. It is structured into two main parts: Part I will deal with the architectural language of China and East Asia, and Part II will deal with specific examples of Chinese buildings within the historical development. It will be divided into three thematic sections relating to forms of human and social activities: dwelling, religious pursuits and political manifestations. These are the most essential activities of the human world, individually and collectively, in the traditional period of time. Here, the language of the architectural form will be overlaid with historical and cultural contexts so that the perception of these forms and meaning ascribed to them by their users will be explored.",

It provides an understanding of the physical aspects of the city around and beyond architecture to allow the students to think critically about the spatial phenomena of contemporary urbanism. By reading and analyzing various components of the urban built environment, students learn to develop systematic approaches to understanding the relationship between spatial design and the city holistically across multiple spatial scales. The course is organized into three interrelated modules: (1) ‘Urban Morphology’ reviews classic and contemporary discourses pertaining to how urban built environment is to be designed; (2) ‘Urban Landscape’ introduces the increasingly important field of landscape architecture in urban development; (3) ‘Urban Sustainability’ explores theories and practices associated with the ideology of sustainable or eco cities.",

What are the physical attributes of different forms? What shape cities? The course refers to The City Shaped by Spiro Kostof as textbook, and draws upon a broader list of other readings. It includes a number of lectures to examine the form and process of cities. The course material focuses on five predominant city forms in history namely: the organic pattern, the grid, city as diagram, the grand manner of cities, and skyscraper cities. Using Hong Kong as a site of investigation, students will examine the physical attributes and historical process of particular places, and critically evaluate them against the form of cities.",

This course, through different projects, will allow students to learn the process of building design and hone their design skill by either focusing on specific aspects of architecture or addressing various factors that influences the architectural form. These factors include activities, environmental technology, sustainable design and urban setting. Students are also required to demonstrate an understanding of structure, construction system and materials through their design.",

Using specific sites in Hong Kong as a context, the studio searches for the design of architecture and settings so as to respond to: 1) the disintegration of urban fabric; 2) the ineffective use of space; and 3) the lack of a coherent urban strategic plan. Behind the studio is an attempt to use architectural design as a vehicle to explore alternative urban strategies to current architectural and planning practices in Hong Kong.",

This course, through different projects, will allow students to learn the process of building design and hone their design skill by either focusing on specific aspects of architecture or addressing various factors that influences the architectural form. These factors include activities, environmental technology, sustainable design and urban setting. Students are also required to demonstrate an understanding of structure, construction system and materials through their design.",

      "course_syllabus": "The intention behind comprehensive building is to guide students in the design of a building that addresses most of the issues common to a medium size building. Some aspects of the design may remain at a schematic level, such as the structural system, the site development or certain building services, such as fire code compliance (the design should demonstrate an understanding of egress requirements and other basic fire safety design rules). Other areas should indicate a level of development beyond previous studio work. The accommodation of program area requirements should be met and the spatial composition of the plan resolved to a higher level than previous work (compare to U5). The use and functions of the major space should be carefully studied and articulated. The design should satisfy these fundamental requirements while also expressing a design concept that has clarity and a consistent formal order.",

In these works - office buildings, shopping centres, airports, multifunctional urban complexes, etc. - students will examine what occurred, architecturally and globally, as a result of the historical changes they have studied in the first two courses of the sequence. In so doing, students will be well-grounded in understanding historical continuities and ruptures, as well as the unity of forms and diversity of solutions.

It provides an understanding of the physical aspects of the city around and beyond architecture to allow the students to think critically about the spatial phenomena of contemporary urbanism. By reading and analyzing various components of the urban built environment, students learn to develop systematic approaches to understanding the relationship between spatial design and the city holistically across multiple spatial scales. The course is organized into three interrelated modules: (1) ‘Urban Morphology’ reviews classic and contemporary discourses pertaining to how urban built environment is to be designed; (2) ‘Urban Landscape’ introduces the increasingly important field of landscape architecture in urban development; (3) ‘Urban Sustainability’ explores theories and practices associated with the ideology of sustainable or eco cities.",

It includes a number of lectures to examine the form and process of cities. The course material focuses on five predominant city forms in history namely: the organic pattern, the grid, city as diagram, the grand manner of cities, and skyscraper cities. Using Hong Kong as a site of investigation, students will examine the physical attributes and historical process of particular places, and critically evaluate them against the form of cities.",

      "course_syllabus": "This course will explore ideas on informal architecture and urbanism. In early societies, spatial orders were evolved out of the necessities of daily patterns. People dwelled under shelters, exchanged at crossroads, played on open fields, and defended within walls. Settlements, then cities, were shaped and rebuilt according to prescribed orders of divinity or democracy. Architecture and its extending urbanism, thus, take forms to accommodate, to contain and even to express design ideas. But when forms are substituting spaces, and formalities are replacing meanings, architecture without its proper engagement of the people’s cultures and their associated ethos will become a convention, or simply an art of composition.\n\nIn places under the pressure of rapid development, like most Asian cities, where transplantations of formal architecture and urbanism colonize prominent locations, core values of local communities have been diluted. In fact, there is much to be appreciated when we ‘go to the crowds’ and learn from them how to cohabit with the conditions. Recently there has been a social awareness of the local culture and its direct application in design. And if we examine the ways of living and see how they are transforming spaces to be informal but meaningful, our environment will be more colorful and humanized, just like David Adjaye noted, “…A similar notion could be applied to the way that vines work with walls in a symbiotic way; they start to destabilize the wall and eventually the two cohabit. And co-dependency becomes a requirement of this cohabitation.”\n\nIn this perspective, we will put forward critical issues on urban phenomenon, organic growth, collective memory, public engagement and community building. Cases will be introduced, students’ initiatives will be encouraged and guest speakers from Asian cities will be invited to confer further ideas.",

Students are expected to design an architectural proposal from concept to final representation, through careful consideration to scale, context, tectonics, material and technology. The course offers a wide range of topics including: Urbanism, Building Technology, History & Theory, Digital Design and Design & Practice. It is geared towards developing innovative forms of competence and enabling students to work on different architectural fields, from the design of urban masterplans to individual buildings, from landscape redevelopments to adaptive reuse of existing buildings, from sustainable building designs to application of the latest building technologies.",

Students are expected to design an architectural proposal from concept to final representation, through careful consideration to scale, context, tectonics, material and technology. The course offers a wide range of topics including: Urbanism, Building Technology, History & Theory, Digital Design and Design & Practice. It is geared towards developing innovative forms of competence and enabling students to work on different architectural fields, from the design of urban masterplans to individual buildings, from landscape redevelopments to adaptive reuse of existing buildings, from sustainable building designs to application of the latest building technologies.",
