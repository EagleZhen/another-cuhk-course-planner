Another means of evaluation is using Course and Teaching Evaluation to evaluate the course. There are also opportunities for students to feedback about the course, lectures, tutorials and lab days during the staff-student consultative committee. During the lectures, tutorials and lab days, students are welcomed to approach the teaching staff to give their feedback as well.\n\nStudents can review their assessment materials. The review period will be held within two weeks after grades are released to students. The date will be determined by the Course Coordinator. Student who wishes to review the assessment materials must make a formal request to the Year Administrator within four calendar days after grades are released.",

The pathophysiological basis and pharmacological treatment of medical-surgical nursing conditions will be examined together with the principles of therapeutic management and nursing therapeutics skills. Students will learn to assess, plan and implement appropriate evidence-based nursing interventions to reduce or overcome the effects of these conditions.",
