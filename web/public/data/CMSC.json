The student will have an academic supervisor as assigned by the Professor-in-Charge and an industry supervisor from the company. There will be a mid-term company visit by the academic supervisor. At the end of the internship, the student must give a presentation to the academic and industry supervisors, and submit a report summarizing what the student has done and learnt from the internship. The student's grade will be determined by (1) the presentation, (2) the student report and (3) a testimonial from the industry supervisor.The internship should normally take place in the summer term after a student has finished the first two semesters of studies.
