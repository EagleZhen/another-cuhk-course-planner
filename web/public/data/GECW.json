Students may take these opportunities to share news/ interests and exchange ideas with other College members which may help enhance their bonding and sense of belongings to the College.\n1c. Students will be encouraged to express their views/ ideas/ opinions through the casual sharing sessions held at the communal dinners.\n1d. With the guidance from College teachers, students will learn proper presentation skills and social manners via these College gatherings.\n1e. Guest speakers from all walks of life will be invited to deliver short dinner talks which will help widen students’ horizons and range of experiences.\n1f. Students will be able to meet distinguished persons/ leading figures from different sectors of the community who will share their wisdom and insights through high table dinners.\n\n(2) Service (voluntary)\n2a. In line with the Vision Statement of the College to be ‘involved’, students will be encouraged to participate in social and community services that reflect their interests and engage their passions; they may also make use of their own skills and aptitudes in the service of others.\n2b. Through such service opportunities, students will learn and grow, and develop responsibility and leadership.",

Students (either on individual or group basis) may take these opportunities to share their field trip/ exchange/ service-learning experiences with other College members; amusements/ leisure activities may also be arranged in these sessions.\n1d. High table dinners will be arranged several times a year.\n1e. Students must enrol in the College meal plan for communal dining.\n1f. The requirement of communal dining will only apply to those in residence, but students who are not in residence (e.g., MBChB students after the fourth year) may participate in some communal dining on a voluntary basis.\n\n(2) Service (voluntary)\n2a. Students of CW Chu College will be encouraged to take part in a range of social and civic service activities, on a voluntary basis. Some of these activities may be organized by the College; others may be organized by various units within CUHK/ partner organizations. Such service per se is not credit earning.\n2b. Students may consider combining the service activities with Senior Seminar. If so, they need to plan ahead of time, and submit to the College GE Office a preliminary project proposal for Senior Seminar before the service activities take place.\n2c. Detailed arrangements on social and community services will be worked out by the Mentorship and Internship Committee of CW Chu College in due course.",

      "description": "This course gives students the opportunity to synthesize their academic skills beyond the limits of the major programme, engage with a real-life issue of relevance to society, analyze the factors, constraints and options, and present their findings in a cogent, reasoned and persuasive manner.\n\nIn this student-oriented course, each small group will select a topic ideally of interdisciplinary nature; conduct field, survey or literature research; make a presentation and submit a written report. With preparation in the preceding term and most of the research work done in the summer, each group will make an oral presentation and submit a written report in the first term, normally in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th year of study (or as suitably adjusted in the case of students admitted with Advanced Standing, variations to be approved by the Chair of the GE Committee of the College).\n\nAdvisory:\n\n1. Students must have taken GECW4010 OR GECW4021 OR GECW4022 before they can graduate. Students are advised to inform the College Office of their plans as early as possible. (Note: GECW4010 will no longer be offered from 2022–23 onwards, but is written into the above condition to cater for students in the pipeline who have already taken GECW4010.)\n\n2. Students enrolled in programmes that require more than four years (e.g. BEd, MBChB, BChiMed) should normally follow the same schedule and register for the course not later than the 4th year of study. Students who for reasons such as exchange or internship need flexibility of arrangement should apply to the College for approval.\n\n3. Students should pre-register with the College in the preceding term, and conduct most of the research project required in the summer.\n\n4. For students who have time-tabling difficulties due to outbound exchange or term-time internship arrangements, may take one of the options below:\n\ni) Option 1. Students who go on exchange in Term 1 may still join teams to do their projects in the preceding summer, on their own schedule. These students must make normal contributions. The rest of the team will register and make presentations in Term 1 as usual, but the student(s) who are on exchange in Term 1 will register and make presentations in Term 2.\n\nii) Option 2. If Option 1 is for any reason not feasible, then students may take IASP4280 as an alternative. If IASP4280 is not offered, IASP4090 will be the alternative.\n\niii) Option 3. If Option 2 is also for any reason not feasible, then students may apply to take a University GE course of the same number of units; approval is granted only if the course is broadly similar.\nThe above options are (a) available only to students who are on approved exchange or approved internship in Term 1, and (b) every case must be subject to individual approval at the normal time when project teams are formed.\n\nStudents pre-assigned to this course are advised to pay special attention to the latest information and arrangement of the course via the mass email and Blackboard messages issued by the College.",

Through such service opportunities, students will learn and grow, and develop responsibility and leadership. The expected learning outcomes are\n\n(1) An appreciation of some of the wider issues in society (either local, regional, national or global), and an interest and ability to engage with these issues in a mature and scholarly manner (V, K)\n\n(2) A rudimentary ability to plan, organize and evaluate service projects, and through that experience the ability to engage with broader issues not related to the major subject, and basic knowledge of research methodology (S, K)\n\n(3) The willingness and ability to work in a team with members drawn from different backgrounds (V, S)\n\n(4) An appreciation of plural values and conflicting choices in society, and a recognition that all choices involve consequences; an appreciation of the value of personal contributions to issue in society (V)\n\n(5) The ability to collect and analyze data, to reflect on service experience, to synthesize ideas and to present arguments in both oral and written forms, at a level appropriate to a university graduate (S)\n\nK = knowledge; S = skill; V = value",
