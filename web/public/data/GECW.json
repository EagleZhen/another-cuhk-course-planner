      "description": "This course gives students the opportunity to synthesize their academic skills beyond the limits of the major programme, engage with a real-life issue of relevance to society, analyze the factors, constraints and options, and present their findings in a cogent, reasoned and persuasive manner. In this student-oriented course, each small group will select a topic ideally of interdisciplinary nature; conduct field, survey or literature research; make a presentation and submit a written report. With preparation in the preceding term and most of the research work done in the summer, each group will make an oral presentation and submit a written report in the first term, normally in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th year of study (or as suitably adjusted in the case of students admitted with Advanced Standing, variations to be approved by the Chair of the GE Committee of the College). Advisory:1. Students must have taken GECW4010 OR GECW4021 OR GECW4022 before they can graduate. Students are advised to inform the College Office of their plans as early as possible. (Note: GECW4010 will no longer be offered from 2022–23 onwards, but is written into the above condition to cater for students in the pipeline who have already taken GECW4010.)2. Students enrolled in programmes that require more than four years (e.g. BEd, MBChB, BChiMed) should normally follow the same schedule and register for the course not later than the 4th year of study. Students who for reasons such as exchange or internship need flexibility of arrangement should apply to the College for approval. 3. Students should pre-register with the College in the preceding term, and conduct most of the research project required in the summer.4. For students who have time-tabling difficulties due to outbound exchange or term-time internship arrangements, may take one of the options below:i) Option 1. Students who go on exchange in Term 1 may still join teams to do their projects in the preceding summer, on their own schedule. These students must make normal contributions. The rest of the team will register and make presentations in Term 1 as usual, but the student(s) who are on exchange in Term 1 will register and make presentations in Term 2. ii) Option 2. If Option 1 is for any reason not feasible, then students may take IASP4280 as an alternative. If IASP4280 is not offered, IASP4090 will be the alternative.iii) Option 3. If Option 2 is also for any reason not feasible, then students may apply to take a University GE course of the same number of units; approval is granted only if the course is broadly similar. The above options are (a) available only to students who are on approved exchange or approved internship in Term 1, and (b) every case must be subject to individual approval at the normal time when project teams are formed.Students pre-assigned to this course are advised to pay special attention to the latest information and arrangement of the course via the mass email and Blackboard messages issued by the College.",

Through such service opportunities, students will learn and grow, and develop responsibility and leadership.In this student-orientated course, students will form small teams to carry out voluntary social and civic service activities in the preceding years, with project proposal approved beforehand by the teacher(s) responsible for this course together with the Chair of the GE Committee and the Chair of the Service Committee of the College before the service project takes place. With preparation in the preceding term and most of the work done in the summer (or earlier), each group will make an oral presentation and submit a written report in Term 1, in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th year of study.Advisory:1. Students must have taken GECW4010 OR GECW4021 OR GECW4022 before they can graduate. Students are advised to inform the College Office of their plans as early as possible. (Note: GECW4010 will no longer be offered from 2022–23 onwards, but is written into the above condition to cater for students in the pipeline who have already taken GECW4010.)Students are advised to pay special attention to the latest information and arrangement of the course via the mass email and Blackboard messages issued by the College.",
