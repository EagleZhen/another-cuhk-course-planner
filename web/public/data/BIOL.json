      "description": "This course helps students build up solid foundation in cell biology for their future research and studies in life sciences. Core modules of this course include: 1. Functions of technology and engineering in advancing understanding of cell; 2. Chemistry and physics of cell membrane and its mechanism of communications and transportation; 3. Endomembrane system and cytoskeleton in intracellular structuring and trafficking; and 4. Mechanisms of signal transduction in cell proliferation and programmed cell death. As the final capstone module of this course, the significance of cell biology in understanding and improving human health and disease will be discussed. Clinical researchers may be invited to share their innovative research design and findings and to inspire our students about the importance of basic discoveries in applied studies.Topics 1-8 introduce students our current understanding about the structures, functions and mechanisms of a number of components in a eukaryotic cell and illustrate how these components interact, leading to cell proliferation and programmed cell death. The final capstone topic “Clinical Application of Cell Biology” inspires the students about how they can apply what they have learned in the previous topics, seemingly fundamental and discrete, in an integrative manner for understanding and improving human health and diseases. This capstone topic will also stimulate the students to think out of the box and realize the significance of basic research in applied studies.Senior Student Mentorship Programme (SSMP) is implemented in this course so that the hundreds of students will be assigned into groups, mentoring by some selected senior students, who have taken this course before with good academic results. Besides sharing their learning experiences and answering their mentees’ questions about cell biology, these senior students, who are mostly engaging in experimental projects in their capstone courses, can also inspire their mentees about the innovation and design of their scientific studies. Clinical researchers are also invited to share their innovative research design and finding and to inspire our students about integration and application of some basic discoveries in cell biology for understanding and improving human health and diseases.",

      "description": "This course provides students with an introduction to the general principles of ecology. The course covers four broad areas: behavioural ecology, population ecology, community ecology and ecosystem ecology. Behavioural ecology examines how behaviour contributes to survival and reproduction. The relationship between behaviour, ecology and evolution is emphasized. Population ecology concerns how populations grow and how they are limited by food, competition and predation. The community ecology component will focus on factors that determine the structure and function of biological communities, including nutrient cycles and biogeochemistry. The course will conclude with a module on ecosystem ecology discussing how ecosystem structure, function and services may be influenced by disturbances. Mathematical models will be used to illustrate the theoretical background for topics discussed.",

      "description": "This course introduces the study of man as a zoological species, through the examination of the extant primates and fossils, biochemical microevolution of mankind and embryonic development. The concept that humans, like other biological species, exhibit variations will be dealt with. The importance of these variations in adapting to environmental stresses will be discussed. Much of this course, therefore, will outline the wide range of adaptive power that humans possess with particular emphasis on the plasticity of human adaptability as a factor contributing to the success of mankind. The final part will treat man as a social animal and discuss the possible future of man in the light of his present activities.",

The course begins with an introduction of the history and philosophy of evolutionary ideas, followed by the genetics of adaptation, natural selection and speciation, and then on to the geological record and the fossil record of origination and extinction, and finishes with a morphology-focussed discussion of phylogenetics and the molecular basis of evolution. Case studies on the use of different data in the study of evolutionary processes, biogeography and the history of life (including dinosaur evolution) will be included. This course is specially designed for advanced level of undergraduates, not only because of the course content, but it requires the students to think and integrate knowledge learnt from different courses in biology, molecular biology, cell biology, biotechnology, genetics, ecology, etc. In addition, a project will be initiated by students based on their own interests that will be completed by searching for and synthesising ideas and knowledge from diverse channels not only limited to scientific journal articles. Furthermore, a lab practical is organized so students can apply what they have learnt in class. Students will also be quizzed during tutorials about course sections and project work. These course features will help students to understand and analyse the problems from various aspects and multiple angles. Feedbacks will be provided throughout the course at different checkpoints",

We will focus on how global warming, and associated changes such as altered rainfall, sea level rise, and ocean acidification, have changed the biological communities of the Earth’s various ecosystems, from forests to coral reefs. The impact at biological levels from molecules to cells, organisms, populations, and communities will be explored. Models for projecting future changes in Earth systems, biological communities and ecosystem services under climate change will be introduced. While the major focus is on climate change, other aspects of global environmental change, such as habitat deterioration, will also be considered.

In the management aspects, students will know the assessment method for deciding the endangered status of a species and thus formulate the proper conservation plan for a species. Students will know the principles of conservation practices in situ and ex situ for terrestrial and aquatic organisms and habitats. Also, students have to learn the basic principles of restoration ecology for conserving lives. Besides, students are required to make a group presentation on an endangered species in the IUCN Red List.\nLearning outcomes to be achieved:\nExaminations: All the learning outcomes listed above on the basic concepts of biodiversity and environmental conservation, including the I&D component (10%) such as design of conservation planning of endangered species, including protected areas, as well as GC&SE component (30%) such as biodiversity loss as a major global environmental issue and the responsibility of mankind in conservation.\nPresentation: Presentation usually focuses on an endangered species on the IUCN Red List, where the students review the basic biology of the species, and understand how it becomes endangered and what has been and could be done to protect the species, all of which involve I&D (10%) and GC&SE components (40%).\nMore focus on the global issue of biodiversity loss; with the use of examples of conservation management from different parts of the world. The design of conservation planning of endangered species, including protected areas, is the component of the course related to I&D. Through presentations on endangered species on the IUCN Red List, students will comprehend the policy and social issues of biodiversity conservation in different parts of the world, thus implementing GC&SE.\n10% on Innovation & Design and 35% on Global Citizenship & Social Enterprisingness",

The course is based on the model of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), where effective teaching is construed as the integration and transformation of subject content knowledge (CK) and pedagogical knowledge (PK) in accordance with specific learners. The course is thus cotaught by biologists and biology educators, who will together work out the most accurate concepts and how they can be taught in the most effective ways for a range of difficult biology concepts at secondary levels.",
