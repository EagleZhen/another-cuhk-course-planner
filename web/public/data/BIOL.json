      "description": "This course helps students build up solid foundation in cell biology for their future research and studies in life sciences. Core modules of this course include: 1. Functions of technology and engineering in advancing understanding of cell; 2. Chemistry and physics of cell membrane and its mechanism of communications and transportation; 3. Endomembrane system and cytoskeleton in intracellular structuring and trafficking; and 4. Mechanisms of signal transduction in cell proliferation and programmed cell death. As the final capstone module of this course, the significance of cell biology in understanding and improving human health and disease will be discussed. Clinical researchers may be invited to share their innovative research design and findings and to inspire our students about the importance of basic discoveries in applied studies.Topics 1-8 introduce students our current understanding about the structures, functions and mechanisms of a number of components in a eukaryotic cell and illustrate how these components interact, leading to cell proliferation and programmed cell death. The final capstone topic “Clinical Application of Cell Biology” inspires the students about how they can apply what they have learned in the previous topics, seemingly fundamental and discrete, in an integrative manner for understanding and improving human health and diseases. This capstone topic will also stimulate the students to think out of the box and realize the significance of basic research in applied studies.Senior Student Mentorship Programme (SSMP) is implemented in this course so that the hundreds of students will be assigned into groups, mentoring by some selected senior students, who have taken this course before with good academic results. Besides sharing their learning experiences and answering their mentees’ questions about cell biology, these senior students, who are mostly engaging in experimental projects in their capstone courses, can also inspire their mentees about the innovation and design of their scientific studies. Clinical researchers are also invited to share their innovative research design and finding and to inspire our students about integration and application of some basic discoveries in cell biology for understanding and improving human health and diseases.",

      "description": "This course provides students with an introduction to the general principles of ecology. The course covers four broad areas: behavioural ecology, population ecology, community ecology and ecosystem ecology. Behavioural ecology examines how behaviour contributes to survival and reproduction. The relationship between behaviour, ecology and evolution is emphasized. Population ecology concerns how populations grow and how they are limited by food, competition and predation. The community ecology component will focus on factors that determine the structure and function of biological communities, including nutrient cycles and biogeochemistry. The course will conclude with a module on ecosystem ecology discussing how ecosystem structure, function and services may be influenced by disturbances. Mathematical models will be used to illustrate the theoretical background for topics discussed.",

The concept that humans, like other biological species, exhibit variations will be dealt with. The importance of these variations in adapting to environmental stresses will be discussed. Much of this course, therefore, will outline the wide range of adaptive power that humans possess with particular emphasis on the plasticity of human adaptability as a factor contributing to the success of mankind. The final part will treat man as a social animal and discuss the possible future of man in the light of his present activities.",

The course begins with an introduction of the history and philosophy of evolutionary ideas, followed by the genetics of adaptation, natural selection and speciation, and then on to the geological record and the fossil record of origination and extinction, and finishes with a morphology-focussed discussion of phylogenetics and the molecular basis of evolution. Case studies on the use of different data in the study of evolutionary processes, biogeography and the history of life (including dinosaur evolution) will be included. This course is specially designed for advanced level of undergraduates, not only because of the course content, but it requires the students to think and integrate knowledge learnt from different courses in biology, molecular biology, cell biology, biotechnology, genetics, ecology, etc. In addition, a project will be initiated by students based on their own interests that will be completed by searching for and synthesising ideas and knowledge from diverse channels not only limited to scientific journal articles. Furthermore, a lab practical is organized so students can apply what they have learnt in class. Students will also be quizzed during tutorials about course sections and project work. These course features will help students to understand and analyse the problems from various aspects and multiple angles. Feedbacks will be provided throughout the course at different checkpoints",

We will focus on how global warming, and associated changes such as altered rainfall, sea level rise, and ocean acidification, have changed the biological communities of the Earth’s various ecosystems, from forests to coral reefs. The impact at biological levels from molecules to cells, organisms, populations, and communities will be explored. Models for projecting future changes in Earth systems, biological communities and ecosystem services under climate change will be introduced. While the major focus is on climate change, other aspects of global environmental change, such as habitat deterioration, will also be considered. Students are required to present case studies of global change biology based on latest research findings.",

Topics include the structure of the human genome (chromosomes), different modes of inheritance, epigenetics, variations and their uses in human genetics studies, aberrations and diseases, and genetics of various biological processes or diseases. The future outlook of human genetics and practical applications will also be discussed.",
