The interrelated development of empathetic understanding, imagination, and creativity through the arts will be discussed. Focus will be given to the design of activities that facilitate young children's appreciation and creative expressions of different forms of arts. These forms encompass visual arts (e.g. drawings, paintings, handicraft, sculpture, photography), language arts (e.g. picture books, poems, fairy tales), expressive arts (e.g. music, dance, drama), and the integrated arts. All the above forms could be actualized in various kinds of play, which serve as an ideal form for creative expressions. With the view to uncovering the dynamics of creativity development, we shall pay attention to the processes of symbolic mediation (internalization and externalization processes inclusive). Recognizing that creativity is the essence of human existence, deliberations will be given to facilitate creative expressions of a young child in the context of kindergartens, home, and community.",

The purposes and processes of various types of educational research, such as ethnographical research, survey research, experimental research, ex post factor research, action research, and etc. will be illustrated with examples of educational studies. The primary statistical tools will be demonstrated to help the participants understand how the tools can be appropriately applied to educational research. In learning and understanding the various aspects of educational research, the participants will be provided with the opportunity to experience how to generate and shape a research question and how to choose a research method to approach to the question.Students’ competence is assessed by their performance in writing coherently and fluently a proposal for a potential research project, demonstrating sound ideas of identifying a research question, selecting appropriate research designs to address the question, and presenting clear understanding of the requirements for each component of a research project. Specific learning outcomes (as shown below) and assessment criteria are aligned with each individual task.",

Topics to be covered include: ways to build rapport with young children, use of toys, drama, art, music and other creative techniques to work with children with various abilities. Throughout the course, students are expected to gain better understanding of children's feelings and needs, and become more aware of the ways to respond to children. Such an understanding will enable students to facilitate the development of positive emotional relationship and improve behaviors of children, which ultimately allow more learning to take place. The roles of family and school in working with young children will be emphasized.",
