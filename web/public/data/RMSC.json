It usually involves some events that rarely happen but lead to huge lost. Therefore, extreme value theory is crucial to characterize the behaviors of these events. Moreover, copula is an important tool to model the dependency among the operational risks from several business lines. In this course we investigate the use of extreme value theory and copula on managing operational risk. Machine learning techniques for managing operational risk will also be explored.",

In this course, we will cover the cat-and-mouse history of regulation of credit, taking us to the present day. Along the way, we cover various attempts at modeling and quantifying credit risk, which will lead us through topics like VaR, copulas, credit derivatives, different credit risk methodologies (e.g. Credit Risk Plus, CreditMetrics) and much else besides. We will also discuss various case histories of financial institutions failing due to poor credit risk management.",

      "course_syllabus": "The Credit Crisis of 2007 devastated the global financial industry and demonstrated that, despite unprecedented financial sophistication, proper credit risk management is vital for the good health of any financial institution. In this course, we will cover the cat-and-mouse history of regulation of credit, taking us to the present day. Along the way, we cover various attempts at modeling and quantifying credit risk, which will lead us through topics like VaR, copulas, credit derivatives, different credit risk methodologies (e.g. Credit Risk Plus, CreditMetrics) and much else besides. We will also discuss various case histories of financial institutions failing due to poor credit risk management.",
